The cassette four track was only used as a mixer for the different sources and also to loop sounds back through the effects. All of the sounds were then captured on the Panasonic tabletop micro-cassette recorder. I'm always picking up walkmans and micro-cassette recorders at thrift stores, so it was my happy day when I found this gem in a junk shop for $2.00. My \"songs\" are generally improvisational, and I believe the a-side track was my fourth try, and the b-side was the first take.

I have childhood memories of manipulating the tape speed and rewinding or fast forwarding while playing my dad's microcassettes (of mostly lectures). I always held onto the tapes I made planning to integrate them into more high fidelity recordings. It wasn't until 2007 when I met Hal McGee that I started to perform live with the microcassette recorder (sometimes as my only sound source). By 2009 Hal was producing international microcassette compilations and throwing events such as Dictaphonia Fest that focused on a dying format. Needless to say I was thrilled when my blank microcassettes showed up in the mail in August of 2013 for my inclusion in the Museum of Microcassette Art. I planned on taking my time with my contribution, but the blank tape acted beckoned me like a muse and by the next morning my MOMA tape was complete. \n\n\n\n An improvised catharsis in one evening on the town involving a duet with my dog Chaka, tales of a stage hand (referencing interactions with Ringo Starr & Billy Corgan), mingling with fellow artists at club TSI for Joe Van Dykes art & music showcase, e.v.p., & various objects. Essential cut ins and over dubs include singing bowls, drum kit, vichitra veena (in need of a tuning like my energy on this evening), steim cracklebox, broken trumpet, & canjo. Exhibiting 2 paintings (WASTE NOT / WANT NOT) & a fresh mixed media piece (cellular telephone, coal, rat skull, bee, porcelain face, x-ray film, paint, broken mirrors, circuit board, & sea glass on wood) in my friend Joe's show was an honor (ART LIFE - ha ha).\n\n A \"save the world' noise set with Scared Rabbits at CoRK art collective and social interactions along with cut ins = RABBIT STEW. It's ridiculous and lewd at times (like reality) but I hope that the sounds contained in \"Shaman\" encourage you to enjoy life.\n\n\n\nemail\n\njaypeele (at) Yahoo (dot) com\n\n\n\nBandcamp \n\nwww.facebook.com/JayPeele",

He had a micro recorder and said he was almost done with your tapes, and was recording pieces of audio all evening for the finishing stroke. At the end of the night he saw me and was walking toward me to catch a few snippets of my natural audio. He stumbled slightly and the recorder flew out of his hand! It broke, shaking clamors internally. Luckily he said he has another recorder, but even better - the tape was mere moments from the end!\"\n\n\n\nto which Bob Bucko replied:\n\n\"All true, except perhaps 'stumbled slightly' - though recorded mostly at an art opening, I feel this tape may be more an expose of Dubuque, IA's love of the alcoholic beverage.\"",

The heartbeat driven beat and the haunting drone guides the higher futuristic sounds to a intriguing rhythmic ambiance. Part 2 opens with a blast from the past. It then continues with an explosion of wondrous sounds and samples. I thoroughly enjoyed the copious amounts of sounds flowing through this entire recording. I hope to hear more from Chateau D'if.\n\n- Roberto Rosaly, December 30, 2013",

      "about": "Recorded in Upper Mount Gravatt, Queensland, Australia\n\nSeptember 2013\n\n\n\nHal McGee's producer's note, 10:30 AM, Friday, October 4, 2013.\n\n\n\nPlaying the tape for digital transcription was a performance OF the tape. Not a performance of the tape by me necessarily. The tape itself performed or didn't perform.\n\n\n\n In the letter that Massimo Magee enclosed with his microcassette he told me that if the tape slows down or stops when I play it while transferring to digital, I should just give it a nudge, and to leave these moments in the digital master - they are intentional.\n\n As with all previous MOMA albums I attempted to play Magee's tape in my Panasonic RR-930 desktop microcassette transcriber. This worked pretty well for a few minutes, and I was amused at the tape stopping and me getting to nudge it by pushing the PLAY button on the recorder, or, if that didn't work, pressing FAST FORWARD just a bit, and then PLAY again. I got the sense that I was performing the tape, or, rather, that the tape was performing or not! After about four minutes the RR-930 simply would not move the tape forward any more, no matter how much I tried to FF or PLAY the tape. It simply stopped. WTF, I thought! I ejected the tape from the deck to find that the tape had come unspooled from inside the microcassette and was crinkled as well! Additionally, I saw what looked like blue paint affixed to the the tape itself. I inserted the shaft of a ballpoint pen in one of the MC's spindle holes and spooled the tape back up into the microcassette shell. \n\n I cleaned the heads and rubber roller of the RR-930 and put it away. I didn't want to risk it getting damaged (since it would be possibly ludicrously expensive to replace it), and it just wouldn't play the tape any way...\n\n I retrieved one of my Sony M-470 handheld microcassette recorders, and inserted Massimo's tape and rewound it to the beginning of Side A. I played the tape in the M-470 as I digitally transferred it and it only stopped about three or four times. Again, I did my best to get it to move forward by pressing PLAY, but when that didn't work I used FF. After about 14 minutes the tape just kept on stopping, no matter how many times I pressed PLAY and FF. Massimo had painted the shell of the microcassette black and I couldn't see whether it was at the end of the side or not. Since most MOMA tapes usually run at about 15:40 per side of tape, I couldn't be sure if the tape kept on stopping because it had reached the end of the side or because of a blockage or obstacle as it had done previously on the side.\n\n Playback of Side B of the tape went much more smoothly, with only three or four stoppages, but also with very few glitch/bump sounds. And Side B lasted almost exactly 15:40, so that answered my question about the ending of Side A.",

      "about": "Conspiracy Theory With S.O.S., vol. 1\n\n\n\nrecorded in Jacksonville, Florida\n\nSeptember 2013\n\nwith a SONY microcassette-corder M-450 Clear Voice Plus\n\n\n\nS.O.S. attempts to bridge the gaps in our consensual reality, providing clues and insight into the world of conspiracy as he sees it, spy tech discotheque and astral garage psych with a splash of Mario paint for colour, rated G.\n\n\n\nDeciphered * best at lower volume\n\n\n\n\n\nadditional explanatory texts by Seth Ossachite Stephens below\n\n\n\nI kept thinking of someone using a microcassette recorder to archive and document their paranoid conspiracy theories sort of like Mel Gibson's character in \"Conspiracy Theory \" in the fashion of a noir detective rambling on into a Microcassette about his case , so my conception of the album is meant to have some relevant information that I firmly believe constitutes the reality of social engineering and mind control as a further example and warning to listeners that nothing is what it seems yet parts of the tape are meant to be stylized abstraction of paranoia secret agent case numbers though I think that only comes off at one point n side 2 , I had a lot of ideas for the tape but there was a picture in my head that I followed until I felt that the basic colors I needed were all there so there was only a direction by sight and feeling and not by direct initiative of words , on side 1 I do a reading from the \"silent weapons for quiet wars \" chapter in \"Behold A Pale Horse\" , the bit on 440 hertz was written by a fellow whistleblower but is well documented and relevant , I wanted to direct the conspiracies to music related phenomenon considering we're all experimental musicians here, I took various bits of knowledge offline by searching on The Beatles and tavistock and also from the Laurel Canyon Conspiracy which I recommend everyone read , search Laurel Canyon Conspiracy and it's the first thing that pops up , it talks about how the children of the Elite ruling bloodlines and military intelligence came together to create the hippie movement and subsequently they were all killed or died with conspicuous timing or else were promoted into hollywood or the pentagon etc. , other sources include ninja turtles , 80's cartoons , Ancient Aliens , UFO documentaries , and I wrote the lyrics for the Mario Paint rap on side 2 that essentially pegs what I want the listeners to know , this album constitutes more of a representation of my ideal conspiracy theory album rather than an actual conspiracy theory album itself , the acid garage psych is performed by my band \" the Space Brothers \" and the listener will experience a moment from my other band \" The Two Witnesses\"a.k.a. S.O.S. & West Of Whisper (W.O.W.) the Mario paint music was made on ye olde Super Nintendo, I also play Sitar and Ectara , I utilized previously extant writings for the most part to assist me in my artistic vision as opposed to the overwhelming task of penning my own explanations for the preliminary volume \n\n\n\nmy birth as an artist coincides with and is a product of my spiritual awakening, and chronicles my development as a living soul, so too I have felt the compulsion to spread awareness and attempt to transcend material illusion and conformity to the false reality we are subjected to in the war between light and darkness , since the dawn of time an array of cosmic beings have engaged each other on Earth with man's destiny hanging in the balance , these beings come from both higher and lower vibratory worlds and dimensions , there is a reality behind the consensual reality we all agree on , many of our conceptions of reality have been suggested to us without our knowledge and implanted into our human subcultures to bend our will, I believe the royal bloodlines we refer to as Illuminati have been working hand in hand with celestial \" watchers\" to guide the destiny of man into self deification but really I believe this is an act of rebellion against the Creator the ages old rebellion of Lucifer who masquerades as an angel of light love and peace , thus when the Beatles sing \"all you need is love \" they are talking about a love removed from the Creator of love , which can not truly exist , it is a trick , we are being lied to by wicked subservients of Lucifer who control the world's governments and technological civilizations , science and math and psychoanalysts and pharmacology breaking down mens' genes and dna into chemicals which can be controlled and turn a huge profit , psy-ops attacking man's subconscious mind , his faith in the Spirit of true life, the war of words which can create and destroy , the battle for man's soul , the matrix , the pentagon creates our subcultures , Hegelian dialect , slide of hands smoke and mirrors master mind plot to convince us to give away our God given cosmic inheritance to the devil who denies the Power of the Spirit , psychological warfare engaged through consumer media , the Masons are the architects across the world building the most perfect prison for the human race , secret societies binded by the blood oath to protect the secret of the angelic power to create and destroy given by the \"ancient aliens\" or fallen ones , the gods , people today do not think their own thoughts , we are programmed and have been successively programmed from generation to generation , I strayed from giving this album any religious connotation but the reality for me is that conspiracy and the battle of good vs. evil is inseparable and yet to the modern mind is intangible and sounds like kids' stuff , the turn of the last century began the last great psy-op for the mind of man \" do what thou wilt \" is the law which permeates our culture , Babylon , unfortunately as an artist I am frequently shunned by the so called free thinkers who have simply bought their conformity into witchcraft and and twist truth into a fabrication of their own to take credit for what clearly belongs to \"God\" or Elohim , the Creator , the english language is a masonic language that further capitulates our enslavement in our own thinking , this is the foundation of what I call conspiracy and this is tenement to my own thinking as an artist.\n\n\n\nin short I do believe this world is brilliantly controlled by dark hidden hands and the truth is stranger than fiction , ancient megalithic monuments ? hollow earth theory ? Bermuda triangle , psychic phenomenon , slip of the tongue acknowledgements from people who pretend spirits are not real ? I found that the microcassette is the perfect medium to chronicle my thoughts as the medium was created for dictation , combined with an abstract stylization almost mocking paranoid conspiracy theorists in good fun of course but providing relevant insight into fact driven information and inspired by shows such as Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura and Ancient Aliens , it's high time for S.O.S. to show the reason behind the name , it's intriguing in this information age ever since the last paradigm shift everyone has access to this knowledge and it's mostly either a joke to people or people carry it so far out it's ridiculous , but the truth is still out there , I've been into conspiracy thought heavily since the mid 1990's when it opened my eyes and I try as best to rely on my intuition when wading the waters as well as humbling myself to the Spirit of Truth that pervades throughout Creation\n\n\n\nconspiracy is a fact because darkness hides from light ! the conspirators ultimate goal is to kill off the light and bring their darkness out from hiding , a global paradigm shift in consciousness disguised as world peace but without a moral compass \" do what thou wilt\"",

      "about": "Recorded by Martin Sasseville\n\nMontréal, Québec, Canada\n\nSeptember 2013\n\n\n\nA sharp, funny, abrupt, surprise-filled microcassette cut-up tape collage of radio and television samples, street recordings, conversations, machine sounds, audience/crowd noises, and more snapshots of Sasseville's daily life, all punctuated with the sounds of the recorder being turned on and off. We even get to hear Martin sing along with the radio, as well as other vocalizations. I found myself smiling and chuckling as I listened. For some of you who are familiar with Sasseville's harsh noise work under the Wapstan moniker, \"Ça II\" will be a refreshing contrast that will still please your crazy brain.",

      "about": "Recorded in Lawrenceville, Georgia, USA\n\nSeptember 2013\n\nwith a Sony RP3538 microcassette recorder.\n\n\n\nI own a lot of Dave Fuglewicz recordings (perhaps a complete collection), and \"Panic Switch\" is probably the downright creepiest of all. It starts out with Dave telling an odd, obtuse story about turkey vultures... The album sounds great, and in many ways is one of the strangest MOMA albums. There's this weird unsettling psychedelia thing going on, but it's dark, not happy - there's something a little paranoiac about it - a feeling of dread, which is accentuated by the abrupt starts and stops of the synth drones - hence the title I guess! VST's, found metal percussion sequence involved a couple of scrap pieces of aluminum: the \"stick\" (hitting device) was a box wrench, the voice experiments involved recording at the 1/2 speed setting. In case you are wondering, a turkey vulture is a \"turkey\" that feasts on YOUR dead carcass rather than the other way around. \n\n\n\nwww.davefuglewicz.com\n\n  fuglewiczd@bellsouth.net",

      "about": "Recorded non-linearly from August to October 2013 in Gainesville, Cape Canaveral, Viera, and Orlando, Florida, as well as Virginia and West Virginia.\n\n Side A features amidst other things Arkm Foam on banjo in a duet with Jenifer Gelineau on violin followed by the voices of Id M Theft Able and Newton and fragments of music selections by DJ Dr. Quinn at the Voice of the Valley V fest from August 16-18, 2013 in Chloe, West Virginia.\n\n Side B features interactions with the YouTube video \"Hal McGee and his new dog take their first long walk -- Gainesville, Florida\" along with many other things.\n\n Rosemarie Romero, Hal McGee and Big Whatever are prominently heard throughout both sides along with many other friends heard less often.\n\n Recorded for Hal McGee's Museum of Microcassette Art, long may it hiss.\n\n Photographs and all microcassettery by Andrew Chadwick.\n\n Recorded with a Realistic Micro-18 microcassette recorder.\n\n\n\nHal McGee:\n\n Chadwick is one of the true masters of microcassette audio art, and on \"Micromysteries\" he takes it all to a new level, and has created his greatest work yet. Highly intimate and personal (you're right THERE with Andrew), yet abstract, funny, mundane, and much more, \"Micromysteries\" is an investigation into the mechanics, the physicality of the microcassette medium itself, as a tool for re-constructing reality via pause button edits of time, fragmented, spliced, diced, rewound and fast forwarded into a microreality that defies linear reality, and explodes notions of past and future into one NOW. I won't give it all away by describing in advance this smorgasbord of audio delights. This IS the sound of microcassette, and I am now intimately familiar with the unique humming tone of Andrew Chadwick's microcassette recorder in the spaces between fragments.\n\n\n\nAndrew Chadwick contacts:\n\nironingmusic(at)gmail(dot)com \n\nandrewchadwick.bandcamp.com\n\n  ironing.bandcamp.com\n\n  youtube.com/ironingfl\n\n  facebook.com/ironingmusic",

VIII: 'Mosquito::Mistletoe'\n\n\n\n In early 2013 I embarked on a recording project titled 'The Blue van Meer Sequence,' a disciplined attempt to stretch my abilities to create and harness darker, more visceral sounds and melodies. Pts. I thru IV were either studio recorded or archived (and are available @  troubledbyinsects.bandcamp.com),  while pts. V-VII were live performances, un-recorded and without archive.\n\n Pt. VIII is an attempt to forge a final moment frozen, a story told and re-told and forgotten and re-imagined. It may very well be the concluding chapter in the Blue van Meer story, the last loose ends I have to tie up.\n\n\n\nSide B:\n\n\"Flight UA1452Y\"\n\n\n\n All sounds found on this side of the microcassette come from single field recordings made September 22, 2013, from aboard the titular flight, Santa Ana, CA, to San Francisco, CA; 7:42 PM to 9:05 PM.\n\n\n\nall sounds recorded/processed/created by d.Schultz\n\nSide A: electric guitar, contact mic, various Android applications\n\nSide B: microcassette field recording\n\n\n\nPortland, Oregon, USA\n\nOctober 2013",

I manipulated the pitch of the tea kettle by applying pressure down on the handle on the pot, which I’m sure drove the mice crazy. You can’t hear the mice rustling around much until after the water has boiled and the book has stopped. I did manage to get one tiny, almost inaudible squeak out of one mouse at the end. If you listen very closely you might hear it.",

Using a 1990s Yamaha consumer keyboard, his cell phone as a multitrack recorder, loops, and an I AM T-Pain microphone, Moulttrigger takes us to places we never thought we'd go, even after numerous beers (except perhaps the bathroom), and furtively whispering secrets to our cassette karaoke machine.\n\n\n\nHey Hal!\n\n Here is my microcassette for MOMA. First off, this is all sanitary. The TP used is from a new roll fresh out of the package and the roll is actually a paper towel roll cut to size. I used a potato stamp to make the Moulttrigger logo and superglued TP on the j-card. The album is called \"Wun/Tew\". Hope you dig it!!\n\n\n\nDave Wren's artist statement:\n\nI used a Panasonic RN-180 microcassette recorder. Most the album was recorded with Yamaha PSS-270 and my I Am T-Pain microphone. I also used the voice recorder on my phone to do multitrack recording. There are a couple tracks where I looped unused tracks I had on the computer and held the recorder up to the speaker. Anything else was just me dicking about finding found sounds.",

      "about": "Recorded in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA\n\nOctober 2013\n\nwith a Sony BM-575 microcassette recorder\n\n\n\nSide A. Machi no Chushin-bu 2005\n\n\n\n Side A was recorded in one take close to the entrance of the park. It’s one of those fake towncenter deals like Busch Gardens. I pretty much laid down my gear and recorded, then packed up and moved on.\n\n\n\nSide B: 捕獲\n\n\n\n The introduction is me being discovered by the park security, who were more baffled than angry. I guess the patrolling security wasn’t a rumor after all! It’s actually an edit of two takes, recorded by a stage where Batman themed shows happened when the park was open.\n\n\n\nEquipment:\n\nVoice, Fender Guitar, MFOS Monosynth, Bleep Labs Thingamagoop, and Cassette tapes through Zvex Distortion, Line 6 Looper, and compressor into a portable Karaoke amp. \nscfiguer@gmail.com\n\n  proudfather1.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n Greetings Hal!\n\n\n\n If you’re reading this, than the tape has successfully made it back to you. It’s been a fun experience planning, recording, performing, and designing for this release. I’ve had the idea to record at the abandoned six-flags rolling around in my head for a few years, and I used to joke around that I was recording my albums there. It always seemed like too much trouble to lug gear, a generator, recording equipment to such a sketchy (and creepy) location and risk being caught. When I heard about MOMA, I decided it would be a great opportunity to finally catalogue an event there, using battery powered gear and as little prep as possible, to hopefully capture some worthwhile sounds bouncing off the derelict amusement rides.\n\n\n\n Six Flags New Orleans first opened as Jazzland in the Summer of 2000. I remember going once or twice in middle school, but I don’t remember too much about it. It was really just like any Florida theme park; rides, lines, food, and scheduled musical/theatre events all kind of happening at once, but with a “New Orleans” tinge (there was an arcade, but I never dropped any quarters there). It went under about a year later and was bought up by Six Flags. They refurbished the park and re-opened in 2003.\n\n\n\n My family and I went to the grand opening that year. I feel it’s important to note the park is located in New Orleans east, in Bayou Sauvage, about 20 minutes (depending on traffic) from the actual city. It’s trapped between massive subdivisions and absolute wilderness (which gives way to Lake Pontchartrain). I remember the parking lot was larger than the actual theme park. We went back several times the next two summers to see live music events and walk around in circles, but it was never a big part of our lives or a regular spot, though it was only 15 minutes away from our home in Slidell.\n\n\n\n Katrina hit in August of 2005. I remember the power going off while watching a news report the night before. Way too much happened to go into detail here, but it seems impossible to talk about New Orleans without the subject coming up. Life moved on and the park became like many of the deserted structures in the area, just something I drove past. There were reports of trespassers as early as the waters receded, but I didn’t venture out until about 2011 with some photography friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n It seemed to good to be true; gates wide open, total access, completely abandoned, and security was but a rumor. I thought it would be the perfect place for a generator show, as Proud/Father was playing out a lot at the time, but I knew people in the scene rarely travelled farther than 10 minutes for a local show (New Orleans east does feel like a different city). I kind of shelved the Idea for a couple more as I continued to visit the location. When I moved back to New Orleans from Jacksonville in September, I knew I had to record there, and MOMA was the final motivation. After an overnight shift on Friday, I bought some batteries, loaded up my equipment, and drove across the bridge.",

Sound sculpting on tracks.\n\n\n\nB1-2 were done using synthesizers included with MAGIX Music Maker MX Production Suite. Mixed sampling means that some non‐microcassette samples were used on the track. All samples including voices were obtained legally and include samples from old microcassettes dating back to 1995. Voice samples for the track “I Always Know Which Way To Go” were produced from old ESL practice sessions during several different courses I ran in both Canada and the UK over a number of years. The young woman (Emile) would surely be proud to know she made such a large contribution. Final recording transferred to tape via direct connection to mic wires.",

I get to spend a precious half hour with a friend who lives far away! The first side, \"Econoise 1\" consists of distinct passages of improvised wooden flute melodies, Casio keyboard sounds which seem to be the echo of the flute, and mellifluous spoken word passages. I do not understand the Spanish language well enough to know for certain what Claudia is saying, but I get the impression that she is extemporizing on the connections between acoustic instruments, machine instruments, and the sounds of daily life in a kind of new \"economy of noise\". The second side is a more layered and collaged sound environment, with crackly buzzy circuit bent Casio SA-1, flute, voices and saxophone. It is almost as if on the first side the elements are presented separately so that we can hear them in isolation from each other as we might usually think of them, and on the second side of the tape we are immersed in that econoise world of experience.",

I wonder if Anders is at all capable of doing something musically, which i mean in the utmost positive sense. \n\n His tracks tell me everything about how he experiences music, and how he can find the surreal and absurd in what seems to be the most common. \n\n In fact a deeply religious attitude.”\n\n- Rinus van Alebeek",

Recorded in and around his home and neighborwoods in an area of Jacksonville characterized by unique folk architecture, \"Gates For M.O.M.A.\" is a personal collage tape that takes us into Kevin's sound world - acoustic guitar improvisations with a blues-folk kind of John Fahey sound, small incidental sounds of daily life, the voices of loved ones, animals, jaw harp, and much more - all punctuated with the stop and start clicks and idiosyncratic squeenk sound of Kevin's microcassette recorder pausing. This tape shows how microcassette can admirably capture/document the archaeology of the present moment. This certainly ranks among my Top 10 personal favorite MOMA tapes.\n\n-HM",

On the other side of eruption, then implosion, someone twists the dial to a brain channel where a 12 note guitar figure loop arises from the wreckage, lives a short life of reiteration and decayed development before it all just burns down to a smoking ember in the dark. The second side is more overtly aggressive, perhaps less variegated, but no less organic and ear-tantalizing.",

      "about": "Artist statement:\n\nRecorded in Stavanger, Norway, in August 2013 on a pump organ that once belonged to my great grandfather. I love the sound of this beautiful beast. For this MOMA release, I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and record something completely different from what I normally do. Without sounding too much like The Wire, I wanted the range of the actual medium - the microcassette - to be a part of the improvisation. I wanted to see how the warm and glowing drones from the pump organ would sound like on my handheld GE 35370 microcassette recorder. It's quite distorted, but somehow the pump organ is alive and well in there...\n\n\n\nIf you want to follow my activities, have a look here from time to time:  sindrebjerga.wordpress.com\n\n\n\n Here is Tore Stemland's review in Norwegian, from his blog \n\nmusikkfranorge.blogspot.no/2013/12/ny-sindre-bjerga-utgivelse.html\n\n\n\n Sindre Bjerga kom i går med ett nytt album. Denne gangen i Museum Of Microcassette Art serien. En serie av utgivelser komponert og innspilt i år for, ja nettopp mikrokassetter. I samme serie har norske Nicole Shugborough og NXP allerede utgitt album og Ronny Wærnes kommer i løpet av måneden (eller i januar 2014). Vi kommer selvsagt tilbake til det.\n\n\n\nBjerga har her forlatt komfortsonen sin og gitt seg i vold med sin bestefars gamle pumpeorgel. Vi snakker her om et lydbilde i improvisasjonens ånd, men likefullt ett godt stykke tilside for det man ellers forventer fra Sindre Bjerga. Her er det tidvis rytmikken som er i\n\nhovedfokuset og tidvis en slags dronestemning i korte åndedrag. Av og til overlapper disse hverandre.\n\n\n\nMens den første delen (side A) uten særlige variasjoner i volum og intensitet har den andre delen (side en oppbyggingsfase som strekker seg langt utover siden for å holde på fokuset og avta litt mot slutten. Man hører at Bjerga var i samme fokus men likefullt er disse ganske forskjellige.\n\n\n\nUansett ett mektig album som krever høyt volum, øretelefoner og stummende mørke for 100% nytelse.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\n\nand here is Google's translation of the review:\n\nSindre Bjergafjellet arrived yesterday with a new album. This time the Museum Of Art Microcassette series. A series of releases composed and recorded this year, yes just micro cassettes. The series has Norwegian Nicole Shugborough and NXP already released albums and Ronny Wærnes come during the month (or January 2014). We will of course return to it. Bjergafjellet have here left their comfort zone and given in violence with his grandfather's old pump organ. We are talking about a sound in the spirit of improvisation, but still one good piece aside for what would otherwise expect from Sindre Bjergafjellet. Here it is occasionally rhythm that is the main focus and occasionally a kind of drone mood in short breaths. Sometimes overlap each other. Whereas the first part (side A) without significant variations in volume and intensity, the second part (side a development phase which extends beyond the side to keep the focus and slow down a bit towards the end. You hear that Bjergafjellet was in the same focus but nevertheless these are quite different. Either one mighty album which require high volume, earphones and complete darkness for 100% pleasure.",

We are also treated to visits with relatives, an orchestra concert, a voice electromanipulation piece and lots more real moments from \"real life\". The absolute highlight is the debate between Kathy and her husband Doug, about the \"reality\" of seahorses vs. unicorns > Unicorns seem to be more real than seahorses, when in fact seahorses ARE real? I was laughing out loud throughout. There is a reprise of the controversy later, and we get to ride along with Kathy and Doug as they discuss words for \"pussy\" and the differences between playing a home version of a game show versus what it would be like to do it for real in the studio in front of a real audience. On the surface this tape seems just about as mundane as it gets, but underneath the banality and everydayness there's something going on - to quote from the info sheet that accompanies the tape: \"Know how unbelievably unimportant most every moment really is, though it may feel as though the earth is opening up beneath your feet and if it, in fact, does, that is an earthquake, for nothing is stable, everything is in flux... Certainty is a fool's delight, a mirage, a buffet of plastic food that is eaten and can never be digested.\"\n\n- HM",

It's an audiowork called RADA. There are a lot of drones, guitars floating, layers of looping synths, soundscapes, and several noises from the underground and a near highway.\n\n While I was recording this tape I had in my mind Russolo and his book \"L'Arte dei Rumori\". Maybe this recording is a kind of tribute....\n\n 100 years of noises!\n\n\n\n\n\nBest regards from Barcelona,\n\nAntonio Clavijo Victori\n\naka Primo Gabbiano",

All sounds were recorded directly with the microphone, unmixed & unmodified, onto the Radio Shack MC30 microcassette that Hal sent me, on an AIWA TP-VA300 dictaphone. The mailing of this 30 mins tape incited me to start recording the 24 hours string quartet that gave it its name, in my living room, with windows open; well underway by now.\n\n Mingled with the very first recorded sketches for the quartet, this micro cassette piece contains snippets of Gersande singing along to Valerian's electric guitar, of the sounds of a mechanical toy picked from the pavement on December 9th, of vendors at the Saint-Maudé Sunday market, of French philosopher Mehdi Belhaj Kacem lecturing at La Générale on the spirit of nihilism, of a metro musician playing in the station, and of my mother, calling from Maastricht in the Netherlands to wish me a happy birthday.\n\n - Harold Schellinx, HAR$\n\n December 12, 2013\n\n\n\nwebsite \n\nharsmedia.com\n\n\n\n Twitter \n\ntwitter.com/soundblog",

I used only the on-board microphone of a malfunctioning microcassette to record through (no direct-in). I found out right away that the sounds recorded through the mic took on a different character from their source so I decided to exploit that by creating chambers to live-record inside. I positioned a cardboard box around a small practice amp (also malfunctioning: it has a short and crackles at times for no obvious reason), and would carefully place the microcassette into the box to record, every now and then dropping small objects or crumpling paper into the box around the tape recorder. When the 15 minutes was finished I would digitize that and make purposely careless edits via music software (reverse portions, add in bursts of noise, pitch shifts sounds, etc) and then play it through the amp while recording again. The process took probably 20 overdubs in this manner to get to the point you hear on the finished tape.\n\n\n\nPBK Discogs:  www.discogs.com/artist/PBK\n\n PBK Wiki:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBK_%28composer%29\n\n\n\n email\n\nnoiseambient (at) gmail (dot) com",

      "about": "Recorded in Angleton, Texas, USA\n\n\n\nemail\n\nVforVictorian (at) gmail (dot) com\n\n\n\nArtist statement:\n\n Side A was recorded from around August 2013 to Early November 2013, though there was one or two tracks that were from earlier dates that I included on the tape. Side B is a straight live recording that was squashed together with some various sounds I decided to add in on the spot around December before I sent it in to try and make it a little more in the spirit of the MOMA. Whether that turned out well is up to you. Most of the sound sources you hear is an old Wurlitzer Piano, my (processed) voice, an unamplified electric guitar being strummed with a microphone, and an old Radioshack keyboard. There is some Microcassette found/daily life sounds on side B, mostly from my own life, though a recorded 78 record was featured on side B as well. There isn't too much of that, though.\n\n Generally the only equipment used was Audacity to process the sounds some since I do not have any equipment to do that live, and the Microcassette recorder itself, a generic no model number recorder by Radioshack, bought from an Antique store. \n\n Generally, the concept of the album is that there wasn't one. I went into this a little over my head, taking it too seriously while not taking it seriously enough. I was happy to be able to participate in a project like this, but I had done none of the sort before on Microcassette or any other medium. What that caused is the abomination that is this tape. Some decent sounds, I'd like to think, but they simply don't complement each other. What I do like about this tape is what it is as an idea. My views on any sort of experimental noise was greatly changed through creating this, and those ideas will go on to influence every tape I may or may not make in my future.",

I feel it is very significant to note that this is the first full length recording I've done in MANY years.\n\n\n\nIt was recorded as a live mix directly onto the micro cassette, using the built-in microphone.\n\n\n\nI have packaged it as a box set, or mail art, with specially created art pieces made of polymer clay, 12 art cards, an info card, and the micro cassette. It is a Limited Edition, consisting of one copy of a limited edition of one, i.e. 1 of 1.\n\n\n\nThe photography was done in-camera, there is no Photoshop manipulation of any sort on the Art Cards.\n\n\n\nRecorded December 21, 2013 in Los Angeles, California, USA.",

High tech electronics, kitchen utensils, children's toys, a guitar with effects, and sounds of the human body were used. This was a very enjoyable recording project done in an evening by a group of good friends. The group was put in a context (by the recording format) that challenged them to create in different ways, and the experience was very positive.",

Some sections are from large bits of broken pipes - the city is on a hill between the confluence of the Monongahela River and a large creek, so big pipes and old works shoot out of either side fairly regularly if you know where to look. Others were taken throughout a manmade reservoir that doubles as a sort of nature preserve (looks like Canada). Only a few of the falls evolved naturally, on their own... and for some reason we're fascinated by them!\n\n- Dwight",

It was just after Chuseok, a traditional harvest festival which is quite important in the Korean culture. We planned a few art actions in the streets of Paris. The sounds of of Side A were recorded using my Sanyo microcassette dictaphone at this occasion, with no particular musical intention. At the beginning one hears the sounds of some other dictaphones playing during a kind of rehearsal, then comes the atmosphere of a circuit bending workshop, in a park, with some children, and then some other street art events featuring some acoustic instruments, some of them of Korean origin.\n\n\n\n\n\nSide B: Stairwells and escalators.\n\n Straight from the Sanyo dictaphone, some sounds of me climbing / descending the stairs at various occasions, hitting the handrail as much as possible, evaluating the possibility to create rhythms and tones. The second half of side B consists only of sounds from some noisy escalators in a Parisian train station.",

      "about": "Hello Hal! Was so great doing these small experiments! A-side is made electronically and live played through speakers. The raw material is a malfunctioning microcassette recorder that I recorded. B-side is purely in the moment, improvising with electroacoustic and traditional instruments (a la Derek Holzer). There is the Mbira, the toy organ as well as two of the feedbacking cigar boxes. And my cat Siri, 18 years old, making playing a bit random (She is also at the beginning on A-side, purring).\n\n\n\nAll the best!\n\nBjörn Eriksson / Miulew 21/12-2013",

      "about": "Recorded in London, Ontario, Canada by David Cereghini.\n\n\n\n\n\nHal McGee's producer note: This tape came damaged in the mail. I was able to transcribe Side A of the tape with the Panasonic RR-930 desktop microcassette transcriber that I have used to transcribe all of the other MOMA albums (except for one). Due to damage to the shell of the tape Side B would not play in the RR-930. Therefore I had to play back Side B of the tape in my trusty Sony M-470 handheld microcassette recorder.",
