      "about": "Humanity is extinct, only their genetically warped progeny, the GenoMods, retain myths of the old world. Unchecked automated systems have run amok for eons, transforming the galaxy into a living, interconnected biomechanical expanse. Planet-sized factory zones and mind-sync hubs spot synthetic energy fields that stretch for millions of miles in all directions. \n\n\n\nLife-form settlements have mysteriously begun mutating into cannibalistic creatures that crave rare oils. The GenoMods believe a cure for the mutation, and a key to their evolution, lies hidden in a mythical human genome sequence. A small group of believers venture into the galactic wasteland in search of the lost genome.",

      "about": "“Since 2014 we have been releasing albums under the death’s dynamic shroud name in pairs or as individuals, but Darklife is the strongest representation of our combined sensibilities, shifting from heavy electronic dance music to bubblegum pop, from gentle ballads to harsh digital abstractions; it is an outpouring of ideas and acts as a new beginning for the group. Much of the album is about the nature of love as a metaphor for our individual philosophies sparking and melding in the music, examining love as a social construct, or as the fabric of the universe, or as not existing at all. As our debut for 100% Electronica, Darklife can also be seen as a bridge between the underground tape and electronic scene of the 2010s into the dance and pop world the label has been shepherding.” -death’s dynamic shroud\n\n\n\n\n\nCRITICAL RECEPTION\n\n\n\n8/10 -The Needle Drop\n\n\n\n“On a new double album, the experimental collective continues its journey from vaporwave toward fractured, maximalist pop music… Darklife documents DDS’s humanity emerging from their once purely digital world. While it still features the internet-damaged sample manipulation that has become their trademark, it also incorporates more original production, instrumentation, and vocals than previous releases.” -Pitchfork \n\n\n\n\"A dizzying, idea-packed journey into fractured maximalist pop from Death's Dynamic Shroud.\" -Bandcamp\n\n\n\n\"...Tech Honors, James Webster, and Keith Rankin of Orange Milk Records are in fine form with the new project, which demonstrates a poppier development since their niche beginnings on tracks like \"Fall For Me,\" \"Neon Memories,\" and \"Judgement Bolt.\" -FADER\n\n\n\n“Stunningly beautiful” -The Needle Drop on ‘Messe de E-102 during NMF The Needle Drop: Best Tracks of the Week in Weekly Track Roundup: 4/17/22\"\n\n“Messe de E-102” is a spooky electro-pop thriller brimming with tension and triumph.\" -What's Good on ‘Messe de E-102’\n\n\n\n\"It’s a bear that death’s dynamic shroud have wrestled with for years and consistently come out on top with adventurous triumphs like 'Neon Memories.'\" -FADER on Neon Memories 10 songs you need in your life this week: 4/18/22\n\n\n\n\"...indie-pop track that evolves into a massive electronic behemoth... there’s never been a better time to be a fan of Death’s Dynamic Shroud.\" -Lyrical Lemonade on Neon Memories\n\n\n\n“...Fucking awesome…” -The Needle Drop on ‘Judgment Bolt’ during NMF\n\n\n\n“‘Judgment Bolt’ continues the search for untraditional dancefloor bangers, channeling Skrillex and the digital miasma of classic vaporwave.” -THE FADER on ‘Judgment Bolt’\n\n\n\n“…a pixelated, dancefloor-shaking blur of digitized beats, trippy orchestral passages and mutated vocals that stoke excitement for the full-length to come.” -Columbus Alive on ‘Judgment Bolt’",

The idea of misinterpretation through \"legacy support\" obsolescence. The fear of abandonment, or worse, being patronized long after losing relevance - and yet trying to savor all the joy that comes between youth and death. A cautious celebration, with the surreal dread of existence permeating from a colorful emotional core.\n\n\n\nAlso available from Orange Milk Records:  orangemilkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/heavy-black-heart",
