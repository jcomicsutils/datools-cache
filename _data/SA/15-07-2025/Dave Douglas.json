      "about": "From the liner notes - Elan Mehler:\n\n\n\nI’ve been pitching Dave Douglas to come record for Newvelle Records since the label began, so it genuinely surprised me when Dave proposed recording a project together. Dave had set some haikus to music in the early 2000’s, and we had covered one of those songs — “Village of No Bells” — on a gig we played together in Denver. I loved the way Dave told an almost parallel story to these short lines from 17th century poet Basho, amplifying the message but also turning it on its head.\n\n\n\nVillage of No Bells\n\nSpring evenings\n\nWhat’s to listen for?\n\n\n\nDespite my lack of knowledge of Japanese poetry, I started reading haikus and searching for a “click” that would inspire some compositional ideas for me. It was rough going. I had expected this world of ancient Japanese poems to yield images and gestures that would be fertile ground for musical exploration. Haikus, to my uneducated ears, were often quotidian and startlingly matter of fact. But, inspired by Dave’s faith in me, I spent weeks reading through collections, feeling completely lost. Then, I found my spark:\n\n\n\n--\n\nEven a Nameless Stream\n\nYosa Buson\n\n\n\nMay rains\n\nEven a nameless stream\n\nIs a frightening thing\n\n--\n\n\n\nI heard those first two words, “May rains,” in an ascending interval of a fifth. A declaration and a harbinger and the rest of the song followed in minutes. I loved building these compositions out of such coded input. It felt like a key to a secret world. When I heard what Dave had been composing in our first rehearsal, it sent me reeling (and back to the drawing board on my own tunes). Dave is well-known in certain circles for his fastidious charts, but not in the way you would expect. There’s a movement in improvised music toward the overly elaborate composition. Mixed meter, thorough composition, elaborate counterpoint, and huge stylistic changes are all commonplace. In contrast, Dave’s compositions are generally very simple but also very precise. This rigor of attention is actually freeing for the musician, because the departure point is so clear. Something in Dave’s style has a clear consonance with the haiku form: \"Start here. Jump.\"\n\n\n\nWhat an incredible band we’ve pulled together for this record! John, Dominique, Simón and Dayeon have such unique perspectives and voices, and it was humbling to see how they threw themselves into these compositions. This band coalesced around the initial gig in Denver in 2018. Dave and Dominique had known each other for many years. I had just met Dominique at a Lee Konitz show, and we subsequently played a duo show. Dominique is a bit of a legend around Boston. She’s been a mentor and a teacher to many if not most of the outstanding vocalists of the last couple of decades, and her years of work with Ran Blake are a continual astonishment.\n\n\n\nWorking on these pieces made me think of one of my favorite poets and song writers, Adam McBride-Smith. Adam has a real gift for evocative natural depictions. I had set to music a poem of his, “Here on the Plains,” for a project we released together in 2010. I knew it would be perfect for this band. OnceI started tinkering with it, I reached out to Adam about working on something new, and he wrote the astonishing lyrics to “Wolf Orchard.”\n\n\n\nThe overwhelming emotion I get out of listening again to the record, almost a year after we got out of the studio, is gratitude. I’m writing these notes in June 2020, and the world feels VERY unbalanced and frightening. It’s such a balm to feel thankful. To feel connected—with these poets, these amazing musicians, the music, the Newvelle Community, Marc Urselli and our home at East Side Sound, the visual artists who lend us their work every year... It all spins out into something larger and it alights on an evening like this, like an enormous gift.\n\n\n\n— Elan Mehler\n\n\n\nVery proud to finally see the CD and digital release of this recording originally made for vinyl-only release on Newvelle Records. Here it is, with four extra pieces!\n\n\n\nIt was inspiring to work with these words. Enjoy and happy listening!\n\n\n\n— Dave Douglas",

Like 2021's Hudson Solos, Songs of Ascent: Book 2 - Steps is exclusive music available as a stand-alone CD and download to non-subscribers as well.\n\n\n\n=== \n\n\n\nThis quintet began playing together in 2011, so it was uplifting for me that we could come together again from our separate spaces to record this suite. Inspired by the biblical psalms, I wrote these while I was in the process of making Secular Psalms, wanting to go and revisit all the originals. There are 15 psalms known as Songs of Ascent. These psalms are fascinating, somewhat mysterious and inspiring. Each of these pieces was written as a reflection of one of these psalms, with the exception of the first one, which I wrote somewhat impulsively on the day I decided to do this. In my excitement and haste, I neglected to give it a number. So there are 16 pieces in all. The first 8 are on the album subtitled Book 1 - Degrees. The subsequent 8 are released here, and they will be immediately available to members of Greenleaf Music. Thank you all for your support!

      "about": "The Dream: Dave Douglas and Monash SZCSoM musicians\n\n\n\nI’m very grateful to Paul Williamson, Robert Burke, Jordan Murray, Johannes Luebbers and the SZCSoM for instigating the invitation to compose and record this music with these fine musicians. In looking for an Australian connection to inspire the work, I stumbled on the prose and poetry of Kevin Gilbert. His connection to land, to people, ancestors, and to love, moved me deeply. The imagery in his work, and as I later found out, his graphic artwork, felt keenly attuned to sound and musical expression. Each piece was inspired by one of his works and, with deep respect and feeling, we crafted a lyric and an improvisational content in collaboration. All the players here are excellent, and in each round of recording and production, these pieces became finely honed and sharp edged gems. \n\n\n\nThe process of recording varied greatly: some pieces used pre-produced audio guides, others had more open ended and free-form frameworks. Each musician recorded their part in their home studio on their own schedule, reacting and adapting to recordings made by other ensemble members. Convenings differs slightly in this regard: the score is a series of instructions for each performer to be performed strictly in time; the musicians all recorded their parts by themselves without hearing the others. All of the audio on the album was then blended together after the fact, and brilliantly mixed and mastered by Daniel Tan and Hadyn Buxton.\n\n\n\nJust as Monash University acknowledges the Elders and Traditional Owners of the land on which the four Monash University Australian campuses stand, I would like to acknowledge and honor the Elders of my own land, the Lenape people. May The Dream be a tribute, and inspire fair treatment and a just, equitable system in our societies.\n\n- Dave Douglas, New York, 2021\n\n\n\nComposed by acclaimed American composer and jazz trumpeter, Dave Douglas, The Dream was inspired by the poetry of First Nations author, activist, artist, playwright and printmaker, Kevin Gilbert (1933–1993). It features Douglas alongside the outstanding jazz and improvisation musicians from the Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music (SZCSoM), Monash University (Melbourne, Australia). The nature of this recording was particularly ambitious as a result of the challenges posed by asynchronous performance and recording (in response to the COVID-19 distancing restrictions), with the performers working across distance and differing time zones and restricted to recording from their respective home studios. Recording such as this enable students the privilege and rare opportunity to be mentored by artists in workshops, rehearsals, performances and the recording process gaining a deep understanding of collaboration with international leaders in the field. This unique student experience is a key pedagogical approach within the SZCSoM, that focuses on mentoring the emerging next generation of jazz and improvisation musicians. \n\n- Paul Williamson, Sir Zelman Cowen School of Music, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia\n\n\n\nThe Dream\n\nComposed by Dave Douglas\n\nLyrics by Natasha Weatherill\n\n\n\nTrumpet: Dave Douglas\n\nVoice: Natasha Weatherill\n\nDrum Kit: Sam Hunt\n\nVibraphone & Rhodes: Miro Lauritz\n\nGuitar: Eugene Stone-Marques\n\nBass: Tim Hannan\n\nAlto Saxophone: Mitchell Hand\n\nTrombone: Oskar Moore\n\n\n\nNobler Truths\n\nComposed by Dave Douglas\n\nLyrics by Olivia Chamoun\n\n\n\nTrumpet: Dave Douglas\n\nVoice: Olivia Chamoun\n\nDrum Kit: Marissa Di Marzio\n\nVibraphone & Rhodes: Miro Lauritz\n\nBass: Vasilios Drakopoulos\n\nTrumpet: Ashley Ballat\n\nTrombone: Callum Mintzis\n\nAlto Saxophone & Flute: Mia Barham\n\n\n\nConvenings\n\nComposed by Dave Douglas\n\n\n\nTrumpet: Dave Douglas\n\nVoice: Olivia Chamoun\n\nVoice: Natasha Weatherill\n\nDrum Kit: Marissa Di Marzio\n\nDrum Kit: Sam Hunt\n\nVibraphone & Rhodes: Miro Lauritz\n\nGuitar: Eugene Stone-Marques\n\nBass: Vasilios Drakopoulos\n\nBass: Tim Hannan\n\nTrumpet: Ashley Ballat\n\nTrombone: Callum Mintzis\n\nTrombone: Oskar Moore\n\nAlto Saxophone & Flute: Mia Barham\n\nAlto Saxophone: Mitchell Hand\n\nTree\n\nComposed by Dave Douglas\n\nLyrics by Natasha Weatherill\n\n\n\nTrumpet: Dave Douglas\n\nVoice: Natasha Weatherill\n\nDrum Kit: Sam Hunt\n\nVibraphone & Rhodes: Miro Lauritz\n\nGuitar: Eugene Stone-Marques\n\nBass: Tim Hannan\n\nAlto Saxophone: Mitchell Hand\n\nTrombone: Oskar Moore\n\n\n\nThe Pen\n\nComposed by Dave Douglas\n\nLyrics by Olivia Chamoun\n\n\n\nTrumpet: Dave Douglas\n\nVoice: Olivia Chamoun\n\nDrum Kit: Marissa Di Marzio\n\nVibraphone & Rhodes: Miro Lauritz\n\nBass: Vasilios Drakopoulos\n\nTrumpet: Ashley Ballat\n\nTrombone: Callum Mintzis\n\nAlto Saxophone & Flute: Mia Barham",

      "about": "Overcome is a new Dave Douglas recording, alongside vocalists Fay Victor and Camila Meza, trombonist Ryan Keberle, bassist Jorge Roeder, and drummer Rudy Royston, who banded together over a period of months to create a new album of songs. A statement of purpose, an acknowledgement of forebears, and an exhortation to activism, Overcome involves the six musicians in an emotional and powerful statement of human engagement towards justice: Racial justice. Climate justice. Voting justice. Gender justice. \n\n\n\nThe project began with a reimagining of the Civil Rights anthem, “We Shall Overcome,” featuring Victor and Meza each singing a verse before joining for a rousing final verse. As Douglas began working on the originals for the album, this unique communal vocal interplay became a key element of three more pieces: “Overcome” and “When We Are Together Again” are both inspired by the challenges of pandemic isolation; “Good Trouble” celebrates activist John Lewis. Victor takes the spotlight on “Peace” as she voices poignant poetry from Langston Hughes. And the free-spirited Royston original “Perspective” brings a nice balance to the proceedings. This is spirited communal music on a mission.\n\n\n\nLiner Notes:\n\n\n\nThe project began in discussions with Ryan Keberle about what more we could do to address the changes towards justice we both see as crucial to our country and our society. Racial justice. Climate justice. Voting justice. Gender justice. Scientific justice. And now the push for science to begin to push back the virus so we can all gather together again. We decided we could make music devoted to civic engagement and speaking out on these issues. And in an election year, we saw the band touring in swing states around the country. Without any touring, those plans changed. But I was determined to follow through on the creative vision for the project and began writing in earnest in April 2020. \n\n\n\nThe first thing that came naturally to the project was my arrangement of We Shall Overcome. We’ve been singing that for years and felt like with two vocalists like Fay and Camila, we could make a new unique version of the piece. Camila chose the verse, “We Are Not Afraid,” from among several available. It’s so strong. Then I began writing the original pieces. The word “Overcome” started to take on new resonances through the depth of feeling and resilience during this time of isolation. We began the process of recording in July 2020, and passed files back and forth over the next few months. \n\n\n\nOnce complete, it was hard for any of us to imagine we had not been in the same room when this music was made. I am so grateful to Jorge, Rudy, Ryan, Fay and Camila for helping me pull this off. I’m all grateful to Tyler McDiarmid for helping us out with engineering throughout the whole process. We are Overcome. We Shall Overcome. Enjoy.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas",

      "about": "Inspired by and dedicated to The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb by Jan and Hubert van Eyck - a polyptych originally painted for display in St. Bavo’s Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium. Begun in the mid 1420s and completed by 1432.\n\n\n\nSecular Psalms took shape over a medieval-seeming time span. The first messages from Wim date to July 10, 2018, when we began to formulate a plan to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the Altarpiece with creation of new music. Research led to a few discoveries: elements of the polyptych were moved and/or stolen, then almost entirely recovered over the years. A restoration begun in 2012 discovered that the work had been mostly overpainted around 1550—removal of the overpaint revealed an almost entirely new contemporary vision of the piece.\n\n\n\nThe Van Eyck worked in the court of Philip The Good of Burgundy, speaking multiple languages. It’s likely they would have encountered composer Guillaume Dufay and writer Christine de Pisan in the same court. Bringing in elements of both these artists helped give me a connection to the atmosphere of those times. With a band and instrumentation in place, we were on our way.\n\n\n\nThen all work came to a halt. Initially, like for so many of us, it was unclear how work would carry on. I kept writing. The meaning of the piece (and the title) took on a new scope as we dealt with the global crisis. Close communication with the assembled musicians, shut down in their own home countries, helped cement the message and the meaning of Secular Psalms: sacred songs for all of us as we are. We continued working. The first parts were recorded around May 2020. Over the course of a year and a half, my score came to life as I worked with each musician to create their performances. New techniques had to be invented to capture interactive improvisations. And new texts came in as I began to write them myself, in addition to the Latin Mass, Marvin Gaye, and Christine de Pisan.\n\n\n\nThis music came to life as a result of many forces: artistic, spiritual, pragmatic, physical, psychic, poetic, and interpersonal. In a visual sense, the piece begins in the space of the outer panels, with muted colors and dank interiors. Subsequent sections explore the inner panels, full of light, showing people from all walks of life. With Edge of Night, the piece returns to the mysterious and darker panels of the Arrival, where Van Eyck’s Gabriel and Mary play out this mystery for all eternity.\n\n\n\nVery special thanks to Wim Wabbes of Handelsbeurs for staying with me through the long process of getting this piece made. Thanks to Keller Coker for talking me through the matrix of Dufay. Thanks to Tyler McDiarmid for being available to go through the countless sound and tech issues as they arose. Thanks to all the musicians for your patience, persistence, and belief in me. Thanks also to my entire family of loved ones, friends, colleagues, correspondents. We hung together through this and we will always have each other eternally. I am grateful for this most of all.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas, New York, August 2021",

Like last year's ENGAGE, we decided to make this exclusive music available as a stand alone CD and download to non-subscribers.\n\n\n\n=== \n\n\n\nMARCHING MUSIC\n\nMarching Virtually | Voting Actively\n\n\n\nHere’s a new suite of compositions for our moment. I conceived of these pieces as music you could have in your headphones when you attend Climate Marches, Demonstrations for Equal Rights, Voting Rights Movements, and all other actions towards a just society. Also, it’s music to spur all of us to go and vote in November 2020 in incontrovertible numbers. Non-voters are among the biggest voting blocs in the U.S. This is the moment when everyone has to step up an be a part of what our nation truly is. We can do it. May this music help and inspire you. I am optimistic and believe that we can make change, but we have to all be involved and engaged.\n\n\n\nWe are grateful to these organizations (and many others!) for their hard work on the issues. Support them if you can:\n\n\n\nSunrise Movement, Fair Fight Action, Brennan Center For Justice, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, International Rescue Committee, ACLU, Planned Parenthood, Black Voters Matter Fund, American Friends Service Committee.\n\n\n\nAnd don’t forget to get out the vote and vote yourself, while taking others to the polls! Work with the candidates, local and national, that you agree with.\n\n\n\nDave",

This album puts Douglas in dialogue with several staunchly creative partners: guitarist Rafiq Bhatia, bassist Melvin Gibbs and drummer Sim Cain.” – Nate Chinen, WBGO Take Five feature\n\n\n\n“Cain’s face-slapping, polyrhythmic backbeat is back like it never left, and Gibbs’ bass is a huge post-metal throb. On “Safe Space,” they set up the same kind of simmering groove they had on “Liar” all those years ago, and the muted trumpet and wavering haze of heavily effected guitar are the perfect counterbalance to the moodiness.” – Stereogum\n\n\n\n“Marching Music is music with a purpose that also widens Douglas’ already expansive palette…. this album’s time is certainly now.” – Something Else\n\n\n\n“Marching Music is consistently engaging and satisfying qua music. The quartet establishes and maintains a strong group identity but embraces a variety of moods... I have never been disappointed with anything I have heard him do.” – Jazz Journal ★★★½☆\n\n\n\n“From the first notes, his music emits a spooky, dirge-like gravitas, often accompanied by booming strings of impending danger. Douglas is the principal acoustic voice, cradled in the electronic thunder of bass and guitar. It is a clear and fluent voice, though, that in the end puts music above politics.” – DownBeat ★★★½☆\n\n\n\n“The music here is a mixture of heavy and luminescent, with grooves and atmosphere sharing space, with engaging melodies (“Whose Streets”) and sonic exploration (“Safe Space”) in balance.” – PopMatters\n\n\n\n“There’s something frankly Herculean in this record that we’d recommend to all ears.” – Citizen Jazz (Translated from French)",

Like 'Marching Music' and 'Engage,' we decided to make this exclusive music available as a stand alone CD and download to non-subscribers.\n\n\n\n=== \n\n\n\nHere's Dave's liner notes on the project:\n\n\n\nSince the shutdown on travel began, almost every day I get to visit the Hudson River. I get to see it in all kinds of weather. Usually I’m thinking about the music I will be making that day. Sometimes I think through other projects in collaborations with musicians around the globe. \n\n\n\nOne thing I have never done is a solo trumpet project. Trumpet alone. I’ve played solo concerts a few times. It's daunting on the trumpet because of the physical challenges of the instrument. I am grateful to Deanna Relyea of Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor for suggesting I produce an online solo trumpet concert for this venue, which I love and have visited so many times. \n\n\n\nThis is the collection of pieces, some created for that concert, some recorded subsequently. Some are tied directly to thoughts about the river. Some are in appreciation of my heroes. I hope to bring these to a live stage at some point in the future! It was an enlightening process to develop them and I hope they bring the listener peace.\n\n\n\nBefore the 16th century, the Hudson was called the Muhheakantuck (some questions as to spelling) by the Lenape, the original inhabitants of this land. The name means “river that flows two ways.” In making this music I bow to the former stewards of this area, and honor the spirits that still animate this endlessly changing land its waters. \n\n\n\n- Dave",

It’s imperative that all of us, together, work for positive change in this challenging moment. 2018 is a crucial year in the history of equality and democracy in our country and around the globe. It’s easy to be demoralized by the blizzard of news. UPLIFT began as a reminder - to myself - to stay positive, stay active, and stay engaged. I hope this message reaches others through this music. Each monthly release will be devoted to a major issue of concern for this world and its people: voting rights, racial equality, women’s rights, LGBTQ rights, welcoming immigrants, wealth equality, diplomacy, science and education, humanities and culture, sensible gun laws, love of our environment and our culture, love for each other. Peace.\n\n\n\nThankfully, I'm not the only one engaged in this sort of outreach. Indeed, I hope that every artist, every individual, uses their work to shout out about positive change and activism during this year and beyond. This is my small contribution: to draw attention to the good people and organizations doing so much heavy lifting on these issues.\n\n\n\nThe players in this ensemble were chosen for their brilliance as improvisers, but also for their attention to community. Each of these musicians is devoted to playing a role in the music within the music, to being part of a social structure in creating a whole music. I’m grateful to each of them for lending their ears and their profound intuition for music.\n\n\n\nAdd your voice. Engage in your local community and in local sources of information and news. I will be making personal contributions to all of the organizations mentioned each month. I hope you will, too. Call your representatives. Run for office. Speak up. All hands on deck.",

      "about": "Metamorphosis is the new offering for 2017 on the Greenleaf Music Subscriber Series. It is a series of twelve short compositions, each named for a constellation in the night sky. The pieces of Metamorphosis are being released one per month throughout 2017 and can be heard exclusively by subscribers of Greenleaf Music.\n\n\n\nDave's program notes:\n\n\n\n\"Metamorphosis: Stars, Shapes, Stories, Sounds.\n\n\n\nMetamorphosis is a piece derived from the shapes of star formations and their associated stories in Greek mythology.\n\n\n\nWho knows when humans started defining images among the stars in the night sky? By two thousand years ago, Ptolemy had published a compendium of constellations depicting Greek mythological figures. These mythologies were later laid out in Ovid’s narrative poem, Metamorphosis.\n\n\n\nThat call from the stars to human imagination seems eternal. Jazz and improvised music are well suited to fashioning sounds from these shapes and stories.\n\n\n\nImprovising musicians have so many disparate skills and facets of creativity to work with. An experienced improviser today not only draws on jazz and other improvised music traditions – for over a generation, the training of an improviser has also encompassed sound-making as an individualized area of creativity that transcends style or genre and highlights the specific background and experience of the player. Wadada Leo Smith spoke of this in his seminal essay of 1973, notes (8 pieces) source a new world music: creative music.\n\n\n\nCreative music invites each musician, through self-reflection, to define and interpret the music’s direction and to act independently within the parameters of a particular composition. To perform creative music, a musician, guided by their own individualized sonic vocabulary, interprets various kinds of notation and input. This demands creative flexibility and the ability to maintain one’s own personal voice among the interplay of disparate stimuli.\n\n\n\nInterpreting star formations and their mythologies, as we do in Metamorphosis, draws on these skills and presents a new dialogue between individual, ensemble, and audience.\n\n\n\nIn bringing these pieces to the group, I found that each player had their own approach to the stars, shapes and stories. The improvisers in this group have vast experience, and many of them are musicians I consider my heroes. I am grateful that they brought themselves to this music and gave it the fullest life and breath it could have.\n\n\n\nOvid’s declared purpose was “to tell of bodies which have been transformed into shapes of a different kind.” In the same way, our Metamorphosis creates a new template for group improvisation, for the creation of new sound worlds.\n\n\n\nMetamorphosis invites each player to invoke their own vision of the stars, the shapes, and the stories with the purest spontaneity and personal expressiveness.\"",

For the first time, we decided to make this exclusive music available as a stand alone CD and download to non-subscribers.\n\n\n\n===\n\n\n\nENGAGE\n\n\n\nOptimism. Action. Community.\n\n\n\nENGAGE is a direct descendant of UPLIFT, the 2018 set of compositions dedicated to positive action. We will be following up with all the organizations and causes invoked in that piece. And engaged in community and activism. People showed up in 2018, and our hope is that this trend will continue. We are going to need to be engaged to make the changes that will save our environment, our equality, our sciences and humanities. My hope is that everyone, in every field, will be involved and engaged in this work. Writing and performing these pieces is a reminder to myself not to get mired in the negativity — to stay positive and engaged through music daily.\n\n\n\nWe’re digging into that optimism musically in these pieces. The compositional rule was simply to build them all out of major triads. Each of the twelve pieces approaches that in a different way, and they were built for this collaborative and communicative ensemble with Anna Webber (alto and bass flutes, tenor sax), Tomeka Reid (cello), Jeff Parker (guitar), Nick Dunston (bass), and Kate Gentile (drums).\n\n\n\nOn some of the monthly pieces, we will be joined by trumpeters Dave Adewumi and Riley Mulherkar. I can’t wait to share the whole series with you. ENGAGE.\n\n\n\nIf you know someone who would like to hear this music and be engaged with Greenleaf Music, please pass this link along to them: \n\nbit.ly/Join-GLM\n\n\n\n Details:  greenleafmusic.com/ss-engage/",

That’s the case with Engage, a new ensemble that features five younger improvisers, each aligned with a different corner of the avant-garde. As Engage, they play low-boil, medium-tempo music soaked in lovely harmonies; it’s not about centrifugal motion or free improvising so much as it’s about depth and connection and body.”\n\nGiovanni Russonello, New York Times\n\n\n\n\"Douglas enlists a brilliant team of collaborators: cellist Tomeka Reid, flutist Anna Webber, bassist Nick Dunston, drummer Kate Gentile — and guitarist Jeff Parker, whose solo is a focal point in the track [\"Showing Up\"]\"\n\nNate Chinen, WBGO, Take Five Feature\n\n\n\n\"From the gospel-inflected groove of “Free Libraries” to the “Maiden Voyage”-style pulse that powers “Sanctuary Cities,” Douglas and company make a compelling case that standing up for shared values isn’t just good politics, but good art as well.\"\n\nJ.D. Considine, Downbeat Editor's Pick\n\n\n\n\"Each track ... feels like a call to action, inspired by the optimism generated by the opposition to the political toxicity of recent times. This optimism is reflected in the compositions themselves...and in the collaborative spirit of the band.\"\n\nMatt Micucci, JAZZIZ ‘The Week in Jazz’ Feature\n\n\n\n“A clarity of purpose is prominent in many of these tunes, with golden melodies leading the charge and the sextet’s feisty interplay exploding the themes. Rather than coming off like an ornery indictment of kids being caged at the the border, “How Are The Children?” radiates a dark-hued idealism that offers solace while suggesting transcendence, with saxophonist Ana Webber digging in to offer a variety of emotions in a perpetually flourishing solo.”\n\nDownBeat ★★★★",

      "about": "When Dizzy Gillespie put his hat in the ring for President of the United States in 1964, he also offered to be the first African-American astronaut, just in case they couldn’t find anyone else. In making Dizzy Atmosphere, Dave Douglas’s tribute to the great trumpeter, composer and humanist, Douglas said he wanted to explore Dizzy’s experimental and wide open mind as well as the influence of his music.\n\n\n\nThis album shines a light on the whole legacy of Gillespie, one of America’s finest artists. The original music Douglas wrote swings and shimmers with a grace reminiscent of the great man. Dizzy Atmosphere also contains several imaginative arrangements of Gillespie compositions, including reinterpretations of two key Gillespie tunes “Manteca” and “Pickin’ the Cabbage.” Douglas’s band is also remarkable, featuring fellow trumpeter Dave Adewumi, recent winner of the Carmine Caruso Competition, along with pianist Fabian Almazan, guitarist Matt Stevens, bassist Carmen Rothwell, and drummer Joey Baron.\n\n\n\nLike his previous explorations of the influential music of Mary Lou Williams, Wayne Shorter, and Booker Little, this album is sure to inspire listeners to hear the music of Dizzy Gillespie in a new and interesting ways.",

It joins \"Subterfuge\" as the set's ballad tunes—introspective and beautiful straight-ahead jazz.”\n\nAll About Jazz ★★★★☆ \n\n\n\n“Douglas eschews basic cover arrangements and instead offers a mix of originals and reworked versions of Gillespie's songs that use the iconic trumpeter's music as a jumping off point.”\n\nAll Music ★★★★\n\n\n\n“Trumpeter Dave Douglas takes a deep dive into the work of bebop great Dizzy Gillespie on his brand new album. Dizzy Atmospheres features new versions of Gillespie compositions plus new Gillespie-inspired tunes and is rightly described as a work of exploration as well as evocation.”\n\nJAZZIZ\n\n\n\n“By taking elements of Gillespie’s compositions but mostly creating fresh works of his own, and centering the rapport with his five bandmates, Douglas has created a loving tribute with its own liftoff.”\n\nNew York Times\n\n\n\n“Trumpeter Dave Douglas’s solution is to dive into Gillespie’s music and rummage around for its contemporary relevance. Classic themes are alluded to, and the album captures Gillespie’s mischievous sense of humour and serious intent. But for the most part, Douglas’s album reflects on his formative influence through a jazz left-field lens.”\n\nFinancial Times ★★★★\n\n\n\n“Like everything Douglas puts his hand to, it’s immaculately executed and bears the distinct stamp of his meticulous arranging.”\n\nVancouver Sun\n\n\n\n“These recordings are a wonderful example of inspired jazz - atmosphere! - and makes you want to dig Gillespie himself out of the archives once again.”\n\nJazz 'N' More (translated from German)\n\n\n\n“Cloaked in Douglas’ own envelope-pushing conception… Gillespie’s legacy isn’t completely dissolved in this matrix, though that fact ends up saying more about Douglas’ brilliance than the subject of his homage.”\n\nDownbeat ★★★★\n\n\n\n\"As much homage as exploration, Dizzy Atmosphere addresses and expands upon Gillespie’s pioneering efforts with an enthusiasm that never resorts to mere imitation.\"\n\nPoint of Departure\n\n\n\n“Dizzy Atmosphere gives Douglas opportunity to flex his trumpet chops. His clarion pealing and deft flurries are seamlessly abetted by Adewumi, supplementing the groove on the melodic glide of “Cadillac” and the semi-spiritual closer “We Pray.” A little Dizzy, but clear-headed Douglas through and through.”\n\nJazzTimes\n\n\n\n“The album emerges as a rounded work, flowing smoothly from beginning to end, and revalidates Douglas' position as one of the most active guys in jazz today, who also continues to create stimulating projects and reinvent himself successfully. ... This new formation has the potential to be his next great regular band. And it promises top-notch music.”\n\nEl Pais (translated from Spanish)\n\n\n\n“This is a fine tribute to one of the greats of jazz led by one of today’s major figures.”\n\nLondon Jazz News\n\n\n\n\"... this resplendent work absorbs Dizzy’s rich musical legacy to open up contemporary fresh paths.\"\n\nJazz Trail\n\n\n\n“The upshot is unmistakably a Douglas album, with his love of mixing surging rhythms, angular lines and sections that float by like white clouds across a summer sky.” \n\nSydney Morning Herald ★★★½☆\n\n\n\n\"Trumpeter and composer Dave Douglas practically defines the \"new mainstream\" in that he spans styles and categories even as he tends to consistently present a trumpet voice that operates in a clarion post-bop area. How marvelous, then, to hear him present a young trumpeter in David Adewumi as his equal in this tribute to the greatest of modern jazz horn players. Douglas balances the program by using veteran drummer Joey Baron along with younger players: Fabian Almazan on piano, guitarist Matt Stevens, and bassist Carmen Rothwell. They interpret the Afro-Cuban \"Manteca\" and the rare \"Pickin' the Cabbage\", using contrapuntal rhythm on the former and a jump band puck on the latter.”\n\nPopMatters, Best 20 Jazz Albums of 2020\n\n\n\n“Dizzy Atmosphere: Dizzy Gillespie at Zero Gravity brilliantly reinterprets and renews Gillespie’s music.”\n\nFree Jazz Blog ★★★★",

      "about": "Devotion: love, loyalty, or enthusiasm for a person, activity, or cause.\n\n\n\nMost of these pieces are devoted to the particularly important people who helped them come about. D’Andrea and Francis of Anthony, to Franco D’Andrea. Miljøsang (Environmental Tune) and False Allegiances to Carla Bley. Prefontaine to Steve Prefontaine. Rose and Thorn to Mary Lou Williams. Curly to Jerome Horwitz. Pacific to Aine Nakamura and the Mannes/New School composition class of Fall 2017. We Pray to Dizzy Gillespie.\n\n\n\nDevotion, as recorded here, is an amalgam of 200 year old songs from the Sacred Harp that Uri Caine and I have been playing for several years. We were delighted to invite the extraordinary and always surprising Andrew Cyrille on drums. Preparing for this recording was a humbling act of dedication, focus, love and ultimately devotion, for which I am grateful.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas.",

Whether on the sanctified title track or a piece like “Miljøsang,” their efforts as an improvising trio strive toward an indivisible whole.\n\nNate Chinen, WBGO Take Five Feature\n\n\n\n\"... the album ends with Alexander Johnson’s sacred harp hymn, “Devotion,” and a performance that captures both the literal and figurative meanings of the word, as well as offering some of the album’s most inspired interplay.\"\n\nJ.D. Considine, DownBeat Editor's Pick\n\n\n\n\"Legendary drummer Andrew Cyrille … provides the perfect rhythmic presence for Douglas and Caine’s interactions. Devotion is an album both intimate and buoyant.\"\n\nJAZZIZ\n\n\n\n\"Douglas architects this music with empathy and trust, and the trio bestows a spontaneous charm that leaves a lasting impression.\"\n\nJazz Trail ★★★★\n\n\n\n\"[T]he feel throughout is of three close collaborators enjoying playing together. It’s a great record but I imagine hearing this live would be even better.\"\n\nBrian Homer, UK Vibe ★★★★\n\n\n\n\"Dave Douglas, Uri Caine, and Andrew Cyrille are master musicians and communicators. We are the beneficiaries of their hard work, interactions, and, yes, devotion.\"\n\nRichard Kamins, Step Tempest\n\n\n\n\"It’s an equal collaboration in every sense. ... “Rose And Thorn,” which comes in the album’s final third, is almost New Orleans jazz, with Caine playing a rollicking, rambunctious babbling brook of notes as Cyrille throws down some serious parade beats, including plenty of cowbell. When Douglas dives in, his tone is rich and full, and his lines, while abstract, convey nothing but raw joy.\"\n\nPhil Freeman, Stereogum\n\n\n\n\"Three strong musical personalities impose themselves onto these Douglas originals and end up with a riveting trio ... that sounds like no other.\"\n\nS. Victor Aaron, Something Else!\n\n\n\n\"If the finest compliment one can pay to a recording is that you could listen to it repeatedly all day, grab a chair and begin.\"\n\nMark Corroto, All About Jazz ★★★★☆",

The record honors the musical impact of pianist and composer Carla Bley, including three of her compositions and new works from Douglas, Swallow and Doxas.\n\n\n\nFollowing their debut release in 2014, this group presents a new album featuring spirited free playing, formidable ensemble interaction and new well-crafted compositions. The tracks transmit a palpable excitement and purpose towards this clear statement.",

(Note: no piano, no guitar.) But scarcity is opportunity. On “Never Mind,” a serenading new waltz on Dave Douglas and Riverside’s new disc, “The New National Anthem,” it’s all about the satisfying amity between Mr. Douglas’s trumpet and Chet Doxas’s tenor saxophone. And there’s a not-so-secret ingredient: those bubbling, two-note globules coming from the five-string electric bass of Steve Swallow, who wrote the tune.”\n\nNew York Times\n\n\n\n“The emphasis is on an intimate, loose-limbed ensemble feel, though Swallow breaks out occasionally and Douglas, of course, has command distilled in each and every note.”\n\nJazz Wise ★★★★\n\n\n\n“The group illustrates its agility while delighting us with whimsy…” \n\nVillage Voice\n\n\n\n“Compositions here do exactly what they should in jazz, creating zones of reference and specific materials, assembling interesting ideas that invite elaboration … they inspire individual and collective performances of a very high order.”\n\nNew York City Jazz Record\n\n\n\n\"Douglas’ trumpet sound is slightly pinched and occasionally warped by mutes, which allows him to converse with Doxas’ clarinet in a relaxed and easygoing manner. Swallow’s bass is a deep throb, and Jim Doxas scampers across his kit and back, rarely cutting loose but always keeping just enough tension in the rhythm that you think he might go off any second, so you better pay attention.\"\n\nStereogum \n\n\n\n\"Riverside is blessed by the maturity of the trumpeter/composer, the presence of master musician Steve Swallow, and the influences that the Doxas brothers bring to the music, not to forget lessons learned from listening to the music of Carla Bley.”\n\nRichard Kamins, Step Tempest",

Much of this music was inspired by the American painter Stuart Davis and the music explodes with the same bright colors and excitement of Davis’ works.\n\n\n\nCombining the acclaimed talents of brass ensemble The Westerlies – known for their work with Fleet Foxes, their repertoire of original compositions, and interpretations of the music of Wayne Horvitz – and the soulful young drummer Anwar Marshall (Fresh Cut Orchestra, Kurt Rosenwinkel), with Douglas’ inspired compositional vision, the album is full of grooving, swinging, lyrical new jazz.\n\n\n\nWhat makes Little Giant Still Life special is the communal music making that the six musicians are able to generate. The sextet unfurls a new view of jazz brass band music with sophistication and heart.",

The pace here is triumphant, and the harmonies (the low rumble of those perfect parallels!) convey a determined gravitas.”\n\nNate Chinen, WBGO\n\n\n\n“It’s tempting to apply a metaphor like “passing of the torch” to a young-meets-old album Little Giant Still Life, but I hear as more of a sharing of the flame. All the proof you need is Douglas’s songs, the Westerlies’ musicianship, and Anwar Marshall’s unwavering percussive anchor.” \n\nPop Matters\n\n\n\n“The five horn parts (three trumpets, two trombones) bring out Douglas’ flair for harmonic hues. It’s almost like chamber jazz, but lively and brash.” \n\nSlate, The Best Jazz Albums of 2017\n\n\n\n“In drummer Anwar Marshall and brass quartet the Westerlies, Dave Douglas has found a perfect set of collaborators—five individuals who are all as adept as he at both celebrating jazz traditions and joyously ripping them apart. … the music often inhabits a harmonically ambiguous zone, floating from one suggestion of a key signature to another over the constantly changing rhythmic map sketched out by Marshall.” \n\nJazzTimes",

      "about": "Dave's longstanding quintet, one of the best bands working in jazz today, featuring Jon Irabagon (saxophones), Matt Mitchell (piano), Linda Oh (bass) and Rudy Royston (drums). Brazen Heart is a heart-felt remembrance of Douglas' brother, featuring a batch of great new original compositions, as well as two spirituals, Deep River and There Is A Balm In Gilead. This new material grew out of the band's extensive travels around the United State and Europe in Douglas' 50th birthday year.\n\n\n\nLiner notes from Dave Douglas:\n\n\n\n“Brazen Heart” was composed on a commission from the Ecstatic Music Festival for a program to be performed at the World Trade Center site in downtown New York. How do you respond to the tremendous losses that seem to keep coming in this new century? Love. Love, and more love is the only answer. To invest more heart and soul into our project, to bring to bear all the passion and compassion that we can.\n\n\n\nThis collection is dedicated to the life and spirit of Damon Greenleaf Douglas III.\n\n\n\n“Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. ” - Viktor E. Frankl\n\n\n\n“Deep River” and “There Is A Balm In Gilead” are some of the most emotionally profound melodies I know. “Hawaiian Punch, ” “Inure Phase,” “Lone Wolf,” “Miracle Gro,” “Ocean Spray,” “Pyrrhic Apology,” and “Variable Current” all grew out of this band's experiences touring the United States and Europe. I continue to learn from these great friends of mine in the Quintet. They are among the finest players out there, and as a team they reach new heights in every performance. As central as the quintet ideal is to my vision as a composer, Jon, Matt, Linda, and Rudy are central to my ability to put together a package such as this.\n\n\n\nWe end on an upbeat note, with Wake Up Claire. It was inspired by and written for titan of the tenor Donny McCaslin, in which we see Donny, in the middle of the night, practicing up a storm while his darling daughter Claire tries to sleep. Claire, if and when you read this, know that we all love you and your brother Henry immensely and we look forward to discovering the bright future you will surely bring to us.",

      "about": "Dark Territory is a collection of new music from the creative electronic-inspired ensemble High Risk. Following the success of the group’s eponymous release in 2015, this new album continues to explore the intersection of creative improvisation and modern electronic music production to create a unique sound that Pitchfork described as, “simultaneously chill and surprising, it’s the sound of a group discovering a valid language, and then proceeding to push the limits of that new aesthetic.” \n\n\n\nLead by two-time GRAMMY® nominated trumpeter Dave Douglas, the album once again features Jonathan Maron (Groove Collective) on electric and acoustic bass, Mark Guiliana (Beat Music, Heernt, David Bowie) on electric and acoustic drums and DJ, producer and beatmaker Shigeto (Ghostly International) on electronics. \n\n\n\nThe material was recorded by five-time GRAMMY® nominated Geoff Countryman (Dr. Luke, Patti LaBelle, Wu-Tang Clan, Randy Brecker, Gregory Porter, Fred Hersch) and mixed by Steve Wall (Semi Precious Weapons, Matisyahu, Meshell Ndegeocello), and mastered by Mark Wilder.",

With High Risk, alongside the drummer Mark Guiliana, the bassist Jonathan Maron, and the beats master Shigeto, Douglas fearlessly follows his muse farther down the rabbit hole, to a place where jazz improvisation collides with contemporary sonics.” \n\nThe New Yorker\n\n\n\n“Prolific jazz trumpeter Dave Douglas has always been an experimentalist—he’s collaborated with everyone from the Trisha Brown Dance Company to Tom Waits—but his most recent project, High Risk, might just be his most eclectic yet.”\n\nBillboard\n\n\n\n“Mr. Douglas, the trumpeter and composer, renewed his smartly probing engagement with electronic music on High Risk, an album featuring Shigeto, a beat-minded producer, along with Jonathan Maron on electric bass and Mark Guiliana on drums. The same coalition just released an engaging sequel, “Dark Territory,” … expanding on its designs with spontaneous interplay.”\n\nNew York Times\n\n\n\n“By trade, Dave Douglas is a trumpeter, composer, and fearless explorer of jazz and other types of music that can be both composed and improvised (they often lie somewhere in between). The group’s individual talents allow the band to put itself in ‘high risk’ situations that ultimately pay dividends in equally high rewards.”\n\nEARMILK\n\n\n\n“Douglas and his group High Risk have created something original here. Dark Territory is addictive, and while it wears its influences—Miles Davis, Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, David Bowie, hip-hop—on its daring, highly stylized sleeve, it’s also unique.”\n\nDownbeat ★★★★½\n\n\n\n“Dave Douglas’s second release with his electronic group ‘High Risk’ is true to form of the trumpeter’s modus operandi to avoid repeating the same thing twice. From art-noise to spastic dub tempos curious themes run the gamut with each track presenting something unique.”\n\nAll About Jazz\n\n\n\n“His volume of output and clarity of vision is highly impressive.” \n\nWBGO\n\n\n\n“Dave Douglas and his ‘High Risk’ quartet are doing is what jazz musicians do best: taking the sounds and influences around them, personalising them, adapting them and moulding them into an expressive language.”\n\nThe Irish Times ★★★★★\n\n\n\n“Dark Territory is a terrific album—dark, moody, virtuosic in a manner both combustible and streamlined.”\n\nStereophile\n\n\n\n“The ever-inventive Douglas ruminates and toasts with a brittle tone and moody mute while DJ Shigeto conjures brooding textures from industrial clangs, abstract beeps and sampled vintage organ. Bassist Jonathon Maron adds to the menace with funky riffs and the deep whoofs of hip hop and jungle. And with drummer Mark Guilliana solid in the holding role, the traditional jazz rhythm section is brilliantly re-cast.”\n\nFinancial Times ★★★★☆\n\n\n\n“The more I listened to the Dark Territory record, the more I bought the notion that Douglas connected with the perfect personalities to vivify his jazztronica goals. The music is thick and nasty, ominous and aggressive, lithe and alluring – don’t blink, it’s always morphing. And it always has as much gravitas as it does digital sheen. The trumpeter has said that this band deals with the “dangers and challenges of technology.” Along the way, their electro-acoustic ruminations emit both seductive designs and emotionally provocative missives.” \n\nJim Macnie",

      "about": "In the years between the two World Wars, the Dada movement questioned, altered, teased and undermined the very idea of art. A century later, trumpeter Dave Douglas and pianist Frank Woeste draw inspiration from that “art of reinvention” with their collaborative album Dada People, due out October 2016 via Greenleaf Music.\n\n \n\nPerhaps no single artist embodies Dada’s slippery juxtapositions quite like Man Ray. Both French and American, commercial and avant-garde, Jewish by birth and mysterious by design, Man Ray epitomized the conflicting personae and attitudes that have come to define so much of the modern art world of the last century. Bridging the Atlantic through support from the French American Jazz Exchange, Douglas and Woeste explore those concepts through a 21st century lens, realized by a stellar quartet rounded out by bassist Matt Brewer and drummer Clarence Penn.",

      "about": "Dave Douglas writes a brand new suite for Monash Art Ensemble, an improvising chamber orchestra including some of Melbourne’s finest players.\n\n\n\nScored for four winds, four brass, four strings, and four percussion, including electronics, Fabliaux introduces new language into the vernacular of contemporary improvised music, looking forward while looking back.\n\n\n\nFabliaux draws inspiration from composers of the early 14th century French Ars Nova, most notably Guillaume De Machaut. Using ideas of hocket, isorhythm, and modal counterpoint as points of departure, Fabliaux takes the players on a journey into unimagined territory.\n\n\n\nImprovisation mixes with timbre and structure in unexpected ways, with the Australian orchestra meeting the American trumpeter on the fertile ground of exploration and discovery.",

Reprinted numerous times since the 17th century, they preserve a uniquely original American musical idiom. Truly American treasures, these \"tunebooks\" form the basic repertoire for countless musical groups and keep the tradition of \"shape-note\" singing alive.\n\n\n\nThanks to Peter Schumann, Elka Schumann, John Bell, Trudy Cohen, Linda Elbow, Nabila Schwab, and Emily Anderson of Bread and Puppet Theater for introducing me to the music of The Sacred Harp. Thanks also to Suzannah Kincannon, Becca Stevens, Josh Roseman, Angela Morris, and to my brother, sisters and extended family for their love and support.\n\n\n\nPress Quotes:\n\n\n\n“... the year's most quietly arresting jazz LP.” \n\nTime Out New York\n\n\n\n“... Present Joys immediately felt familiar and inviting to me, and it's stuck with me since its release over the summer. I think this is because it falls into a certain category of record that I have an affinity for—not just a horn/piano duo album, but one with a powerful unifying mood, a reason for existing.”\n\nHank Shteamer, Dark Forces Swing\n\n\n\n“The trumpeter and the pianist are so tuned into each other from having played in each other's bands for so long that hearing them duet is always an exciting prospect. What makes this encounter all the more special is the unexpected harmonic sophistication with which they approach humble melodies from the Sacred Harp (i.e. shape note) songbook, together with a few Douglas originals in the same vein.”\n\nFrancis Davis, NPR’s A Blog Supreme\n\n\n\n“Alluring ... a 2014 jazz highlight.”\n\nJohn Fordham, The Guardian/UK ★★★★ \n\n \n\n“I felt smarter after listening to Present Joys. Along with pianist Uri Caine, Douglas’ approach on this record sounds like Nas on Illmatic or the Grateful Dead at their live shows. He opens a channel into the middle of his musicianship and just lets it all flow out without anything superfluous or presumptuous.”\n\nAlex Marianyi, Nextbop\n\n \n\n“While Present Joys features a stripped-down instrumentation, the utterly in-sync duo of Douglas and Caine also reaches lofty artistic heights and resonances.”\n\nPeter Hum, Ottawa Citizen\n\n \n\n“Trumpeter Dave Douglas continues his exploration of traditional New England music with this delightful and intimate duet album, featuring pianist Uri Caine. Though contemporary in scope, each track reflects the sparse harmonies, dignified phrasing and sense of community of a bygone era.”\n\nMike Hobart, Financial Times ★★★★\n\n \n\n“Quite extraordinary. The folk tradition through jazz. I suppose it’s easy to embrace the tendency of adventurous musicians, of any artists with a taste for the edgy, to move back to lyricism and tradition. I’m wary of my affection for this recording and for [Douglas’] Be Still for that reason, in the same way that I hesitate to laud Coltrane’s Ballads album. But these records are not retreats of bold playing at all—they are an expansion of a great artist’s sensibility, a way the artist has found to dare himself to focus, to refine, to move in new ways. Dave Douglas and Uri Caine are good enough to stand up to making ‘pretty’ music, even traditional music. They pass the test and come out still surprising us.”\n\nWill Layman, PopMatters, 8/10\n\n \n\n“Spiritual music, solid as Shaker furniture and often as sober as a Quaker meeting, performed by two attuned virtuosos who have worked together in various configurations for more than 20 years. In the closing ballad \"Zero Hour,’ Caine’s gorgeously joyous response to Douglas’s more serious reflections create[s] a brand new world in five minutes and change.”\n\nRichard Gehr, Wondering Sound Blog",

With any justice, it will also serve as a template for future electro-jazz.”\n\n- John Garratt, PopMatters ★★★★★★★★☆☆\n\n\n\n“Simultaneously chill and surprising, it’s the sound of a group discovering a valid language, and then proceeding to push the limits of that new aesthetic.”\n\n- Seth Colter Walls, Pitchfork\n\n\n\n“A hallucinatory and surprisingly organic collaboration between the trumpeter and electronic musician Shigeto.” \n\n- All Music Favorite Jazz Album 2015\n\n\n\n“Many of the tracks, like the opening “Molten Sunset,” begin with Shigeto summoning a kaleidoscopic, shimmering rainbowscape that Douglas and his band ride ever cloudward.”\n\n- Matt Collar, All Music ★★★★☆\n\n\n\n“It is a high-wire act, a \"high risk,\" to be out there, so starkly exposed… there's a serrated groove to this music, even a lyricism and the blues.”\n\n- Fred Kaplan, Stereophile\n\n\n\n“The music is always infectiously grooving and kaleidoscopically coloured, and it gets the balance right between jazz-based melody-making and contemporary beats and edginess.”\n\n- Peter Hum, Ottawa Citizen\n\n\n\n“Trumpet veteran Dave Douglas and his younger allies build their tunes from the beat up, with producer Zachary “Shigeto” Saginaw standing out for his unusually organic-sounding electronics.” \n\n- Alexander Vardy, Georgia Straight\n\n\n\n“Far from an affair with just the trumpet of Douglas, High Risk is just as much the work of electronic artist Shigeto. Together the pair, along with Jonathan Maron and Mark Guiliana, birth a multi-genre fusion of jazz and electronica. Highly improvised, it’s unpredictable nature leaves the listener to abandon any idea of classification, ineluctably leaving us to embrace the beats and layered avante-garde experimentation. This isn’t just for jazz fanatics; anyone with an inkling toward creative, inspired music should apply.”\n\n- New Noise Magazine\n\n\n\n“Figuratively and literally, Douglas has a blast. His three bandmates tear into his seven originals with harsh beats and innovative textural adornments both crisp and wafting, a sonic template that provides him the choice to either spar or soar, and both strategies generate ideal showcases for his often-underappreciated brass chops.”\n\n- Britt Robson, JazzTimes Magazine\n\n\n\n“Voluminous soundscapes and swelling patterns like oceanic waves find Douglas’ blustery and sensitive horn flowing within the band's shifting and sonically rich program of beats, noises, thoughtful music, and creative embellishments.”\n\n- Mark F. Turner, All About Jazz ★★★★☆\n\n\n\n“Beats blend with sharp improvisation, samples and manipulated sounds with hard-crafted groove, mystery and funk and things unexpected. It’s an exciting race to the edge of jazz’s modern frontier, and no place for the foolhardy or unprepared.”\n\n- Nick DeRiso, Something Else!",

      "about": "Pathways is a suite of Dave Douglas music commissioned by the Banff Centre for the Arts in Alberta, Canada for Douglas’ final year as director of the International Jazz Workshop in 2012.\n\n\n\nFeaturing a sextet of collaborators Greg Tardy, Josh Roseman, Uri Caine, Linda Oh and Clarence Penn, the album was originally released as part of Douglas’ 50th Birthday Recordings box set before being released on its own. The album's first track features vocalist Aoife O’Donovan.\n\n\n\nLiner Notes:\n\n\n\nHeartfelt thanks to everyone at the Banff Centre for the Arts for so many years of joy and growth. Pathways was created thanks to a commission from the Centre. It was first presented on June 9, 2012 at the final concert of my 10 years directing the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music.\n\n\n\nGratitude especially to Mark Wold, Theresa Leonard, Jeff Melanson, Janet Amy, Chris Segnitz. Lynne Huras, Graham Lessard, Simon Gamache, the McKinnon Family, and all of the participants and visiting artists of the 2012 program. Special thanks to Jake Schepps for talking me down off the Dragonback. Special thanks also to Jerry Granelli for sharing the voice of the pine marten. Thank you especially to Michael Bates, Mark Micklethwaite, Angela Morris, and Pat Reid for being so indispensable in working for the program. I couldn't have done it without you.\n\n\n\nOver a number of years the creative challenges of the program led me to some deep thinking about what it means to learn to create music as an improviser and as a composer for improvisers. It brought me to think differently about the origins of my own work, and that became a major part of how I approach sharing music and ideas with other musicians. Being a part of that program was a life changing experience.\n\n\n\nPathways brings together many of the inspirations that became crucial elements of the Banff experience. All of the pieces are based in one way or another on the Bach chorale 'Es Ist Genug', which we sang and dissected in multiple years. Aoife O'Donovan was a first time visitor to Banff, thanks to the generous support of the McKinnon Family Endowment. In the opening piece Aoife sings a re-harmonized version of the chorale melody more or less straight, with a beautiful lyric she adapted from several sources. The other pieces explore variations of the material, each piece featuring a different player in the ensemble.\n\n\n\nI was delighted to be able to reunite many of the musicians of my Sextet who also joined the campus as visiting artists. Clarence Penn was a multiple attendee, his approach to talking about jazz and musicianship influenced me greatly in guiding the program. Uri Caine has been to the campus previously in other capacities, and this was the first time he had joined our program. Greg Tardy and Joshua Roseman were also first for us, and shared their awesome insights into the art. Linda Oh was a first time faculty member who I first met several years ago when she attended as a student. I am grateful to all of them for getting inside the piece and resonating with me the feeling for the content.\n\n\n\nAnother aspect that comes together here is the invitation by the Audio Department of Joe Ferla, one of my longest term collaborators and friends. Joe's presence added a sense of security and confidence as we dug into the new music. He worked the magic he has worked on my records for so many years. It was heartening to see Joe interacting incredibly generously with the students as well.\n\n\n\nThe record is a summing up for me: of the great affection I have come to hold for Banff, of all the wonderful young musicians who have attended the program, and of all I have learned as a result of those interactions. It's also an appreciation of all my experiences in the great outdoors, so majestically present in the Canadian Rockies. And of a great partnership with these fine musicians. The unity of purpose in these compositions matches that of the other recent transitions in my life. I am ever more grateful to have the opportunity to mark their passage in music. I know these Pathways will lead to new, unknown trails, and I relish the next adventures.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas\n\nJune, 2013",

      "about": "Even in his 50th year Dave Douglas shows no sign of slowing down. In fact, this milestone proves to be a focal point in a reexamination driven by many events in his life: musical, personal, spiritual and emotional. Three releases show that process, 2012’s intimate, reflective and intensely personal Be Still, 2013’s hard-driving, straight-ahead Time Travel, and his newest work, Pathways, written for sextet as a farewell soliloquy to his beloved ten-year tenure as director of the Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music. Taken together, these three albums represent a snapshot of the trumpeter and composer’s 50th year, in some ways summing up his journey thus far and in other ways only hinting at future paths he will soon embark upon.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas described the title of 2012’s release, Be Still, as “aspirational”, and the story of its creation is an uplifting one. Before Douglas’ mother passed away following a three-year battle with ovarian cancer, she gave her son a list of hymns to play at her memorial service. After arranging and performing them at the service, Douglas felt a powerful imperative to search deeper into their meaning. The resulting album brought out his lyrical side, and introduced both a newly configured Quintet, and an important new collaborator, vocalist and guitarist Aoife O’Donovan. The intensity of Douglas’ focus on the music of Be Still is understandable given the album’s origins, and the resulting pieces are a marriage of folk song and congregational hymnody with sophisticated harmonies and rich rhythmic underpinnings.\n\n\n\nThus began the musical journey of Douglas’ 50th year. The album garnered rave reviews, with Stereophile proclaiming it “one of the best-sounding new recordings [we]’ve heard by anybody in quite a while.” Likewise, The New York Times called the album “gorgeous and contemplative,” while the Los Angeles Times described it as “a lush collection of hymnals and elegies reworked into widescreen jazz.”\n\n\n\nNever one to stay still for long, Douglas soon unleashed a new and exciting record using the same band (albeit without Aoife O’Donovan) of saxophonist Jon Irabagon, pianist Matt Mitchell, bassist Linda Oh and drummer Rudy Royston. “This core group was intended to be my new working band,” says Douglas of the instrumentalists on Time Travel.\n\n\n\nAgain, Time Travel garnered wide acclaim. Down Beat anointed Douglas “the unassuming king of independent jazz, a model of do-it-yourself moxie, initiative and artistic freedom.”  AllAboutJazz.com  wrote: “Featuring some of today’s brightest new stars, the current incarnation of Douglas’ Quintet reflects the independent spirit of a pioneering artist whose intrepid enthusiasm manifests itself in his choice of gifted young collaborators. Lending credence to its title, Time Travel displays the boundless creativity of a group that derives equal inspiration from both past and future.”\n\n\n\nThe final installment of this 50th-year triptych is Pathways, commissioned by The Banff Centre and first performed on June 9, 2012 during the final concert of Douglas’ tenure as director. As Douglas explains: “This record is a summing up for me: of the great affection I have come to hold for Banff, of all the wonderful young musicians who have attended the program, and of all I have learned as a result of those interactions. It’s also an appreciation of all my experiences in the great outdoors, so majestically present in the Canadian Rockies. And of a great partnership with these fine musicians. I know these Pathways will lead to new, unknown trails, and I relish the next adventures.”\n\n\n\nBeautifully recorded by frequent collaborator engineer Joe Ferla, this sextet comprises regular Douglas band members Greg Tardy (clarinet, tenor sax), Joshua Roseman, (trombone), Uri Caine (piano), Linda Oh (bass) and Clarence Penn (drums), reuniting them with Aoife O’ Donovan on the opening track.\n\n\n\n“I was delighted to be able to reunite many of the musicians of my Sextet who also joined the campus as visiting artists,” writes Douglas in the liner notes. “I am grateful to all them for getting inside the piece and resonating with me the feeling for the context.”\n\n\n\nAll of the pieces are based on the J.S. Bach chorale Es ist genug. In the opening piece, O’Donovan sings a re-harmonized version of the chorale melody more or less straight, with a beautiful lyric she adapted from several sources. From there, the other pieces explore variations of the material, each one featuring a different player in the ensemble.\n\n\n\nA special preview of Pathways will take place on September 23 at 7:00 PM, when–as part of Douglas’ annual Festival of New Trumpet Music–the sextet plus special guest Heather Masse will perform at St. Peter’s Church in New York City. This concert will feature music from all three discs and celebrate the coming release of the DD|50 Box Set.\n\n\n\nTo ensure this collection is a fitting addition to the Dave Douglas catalog, a beautiful and rugged two-piece full-color box with a foil-wrapped DD|50 logo was designed to house the contents. In addition to the three CDs–the physical version of Pathways is exclusive to the box–the set is rounded out with some special extras. A DVD with previously unreleased in-studio performances and art videos shot by Christoph Green of Trixie is included, as well as a download card granting exclusive access to bonus alternate takes and unreleased tracks. A limited-edition, signed and numbered version will be available for hard-core fans and a “complete-your-box” offer for those who already own parts of the set will be announced.\n\n\n\nThe music embodied on these records is a reflection of Douglas’ recent artistic achievements and each album represents a distinct view of Dave Douglas as he turns 50. Combining them in a special edition box set, together with a DVD and bonus tracks, provides fascinating insights into Douglas’ creative process and a glimpse of the inner workings of an important artist at a fruitful and important milestone in his career.",

      "about": "In the early winter of 2011, trumpeter/composer Dave Douglas convened an informal recording session in Brooklyn with his group Brass Ecstasy. They were to record the first volume in a string of digital releases that Douglas dubbed the Greenleaf Portable Series (GPS). Greenleaf Portable Series Volume 1: Rare Metals finds Douglas — the indefatigably prolific composer — adding five new compositions and a new arrangement of Billy Strayhorn’s, Lush Life, to an ever-expanding Brass Ecstasy music book.\n\n\n\n“I liked the idea of streaming the music directly to listeners, and it seemed that CD length might not be the best representative in the new medium,” explains Douglas. “Also the idea of shorter, more informal sessions appealed to me as it harked back to the way jazz records used to be made. The GPS gave me an outlet for a lot of new tunes and presented me with a way to record with some musicians I really admire but would rarely get to play with.”",

      "about": "Greenleaf Music is proud to reissue Magic Triangle and Leap of Faith, two landmark albums by the always-innovative trumpeter/composer Dave Douglas. Originally recorded in the late 1990s, these two albums comprise the entire catalogue of the Dave Douglas Quartet featuring tenor saxophonist Chris Potter, bassist James Genus, and drummer Ben Perowsky, each of whom have remained crucial voices in the modern jazz world. Both discs highlight Douglas’ gift for dense, multi-hued compositions that draw equally from across the jazz spectrum, creating captivating environments for his collaborators to explore.\n\n\n\nOne of jazz’s most renowned trumpeters, composers and conceptualists, Douglas’ career is characterized by his restless imagination, continuous series of reinventions that present his compositional ideas in evolving and novel contexts. The quartet on these two stellar releases, offered here in a single comprehensive package, presented Douglas with the opportunity to write for three melodic voices.\n\n\n\nAs it turned out, those voices belonged to some of Douglas’ most fruitful collaborators: Potter, who has since founded the acclaimed electric group Underground, was an original member of the trumpeter’s long-running quintet. Genus continues to hold the bass chair in that group, as well as in the new Sound Prints Quintet with Joe Lovano, Lawrence Fields and Joey Baron, while appearing weekly as part of the Saturday Night Live band. Drummer Ben Perowsky has continually blurred the jazz/rock divide, leading his own eclectic Moodswing Orchestra and playing alongside the likes of John Zorn, Uri Caine, and Rickie Lee Jones.\n\n\n\n “You ever notice how a four-legged chair is often crooked but a three-legged stool is solid?” Douglas writes in his brief liner notes. On 1997’s Magic Triangle, he continues, “I was trying to see how much harmony I could get into the game with just three notes.”\n\n\n\nThe answer is plenty, as the album’s nine diverse, harmonically-rich tunes prove. Magic Triangle is a gleeful exercise in shrugging off genre definitions, vaulting jauntily between post-bop burning and more jagged avant angles. “Everyman” starts the album off at a brisk tear, Douglas and Potter wending hearty, fluid lines around one another as Genus and Perowsky lay down a mighty, eccentric swing. The title tune follows with the horns musing tenderly over Genus’ contemplative pulse and Perowsky’s rainfall shadings. The album proceeds in similarly surmising fashion, from the Ornette Coleman-inflected zig-zags of “Padded Cell” to the tender miniature “Kisangani” to the off-kilter sprightliness of “Coaster.”\n\n\n\nOriginally released in 2000, Leap of Faith is exactly that – a headlong plunge into the unknown, brimming with excitement and mystery. Moodier and more intricate than its predecessor, the album presents a stunning evolution of both Douglas’ compositional range and the quartet’s brilliant interplay. “Though still with the concept of creating worlds with three voices,” Douglas writes, “the geometry got a lot more complex.”\n\n\n\nThat geometry manifests itself immediately with the elusive, idiosyncratic lines and hiccupping rhythms of “Caterwaul,” darkening for the stormcloud rumble of the title track. Shifting from the skittering rhythms of “Millennium Bug” to the cartoonish round-robin of “Emmenthaler” to the slippery bop of “Guido’s High Note,” Leap of Faith finds Douglas reinventing the group’s sound with each new track, and sometimes more than once within a single tune.\n\n\n\n“We had a lot of fun playing with this band,” Douglas states simply, and the joy of discovery permeates both albums included within this welcome reissue. More than archival evidence of four modern jazz masters at an earlier stage of their respective careers, Magic Triangle and Leap of Faith offer two albums’ worth of agile musicianship navigating tricky, consistently surprising, and richly rewarding waters.",

      "about": "The third volume of the Greenleaf Portable Series (GPS), Bad Mango features Dave Douglas with So Percussion. From the first notes of the opening track One More News—originally recorded on Witness [2001]—it’s clear that this session yielded a sound unlike any other in the expansive Dave Douglas discography. Pairing his plaintive trumpet with a myriad of percussion instruments including marimba, drumset, glockenspiel, and a whole host of nontraditional percussion like musical saw, toy bells, shruti box, crotales, et al, Douglas leads this unique ensemble through new compositions and revisitations of songs from his works catalog.",

      "about": "Originally recorded by WBGO Jazz 88 and presented as part of NPR’s live concert series, the album captures the group’s spectacular performance during the 2010 Carefusion Newport Jazz Festival.\n\n\n\n“There was a special feeling for us on taking the drive out to the festival grounds at Fort Adams State Park,” said Douglas. “On the day of the gig, each of us was flying in from a different location. The weather was cooperating, and I remember watching boats in the harbor…such a magnificent setting. During the set each of the tunes grew into new proportions that day, stretching in all sorts of directions from their original studio release.”\n\n\n\nPicking up where their critically acclaimed debut Spirit Moves (Greenleaf 2009) left off, United Front (Douglas’ 32nd release) sees this all-star band plunging into Douglas’ compositions (plus one Hank Williams Sr. tune) with an intensity and exuberance garnered only at a live jazz concert, particularly one with the legacy and spirit of Newport. The album features tunes from Spirit Moves including the 12-plus minute set closer “Bowie” – a tribute to Lester Bowie – that steadily works the crowd into a loud and appreciative frenzy. Also included are two previously unreleased songs, “Spirit Moves” and “United Front.”",

      "about": "The second volume of the Greenleaf Portable Series (GPS), Orange Afternoons features Dave Douglas, Ravi Coltrane, Vijay Iyer, Linda Oh, and Marcus Gilmore. This informal session in Brooklyn yielded six new Douglas compositions for this special quintet.\n\n\n\nThe album opener—The Gulf—begins delicately with Iyer rolling clusters and Gilmore frosting the spectrum with cymbals before the plaintive melody offers the first taste of the frontline of Douglas’ trumpet and Coltrane’s saxophone. Moving along, Valori Bollati—translated as Revenue Stamps—swings it’s way into gorgeous solos by Iyer and Oh. Solato features a simple harmonic figure floating on top of a deep groove, and a solo from Douglas that culminates in a single long tone towering over a wash before fizzling back to the intro figure. All in all, the six tracks on this album feel immediate, with urgent playing from each of these stalwart musicians.",

      "about": "Moonshine, by trumpeter/composer Dave Douglas with his Grammy-nominated band Keystone, is an album that moves musical genres forward into uncharted territory. The evolutionary, revolutionary aspect is found in the vibrant alchemy between Douglas’ avant-garde leaning compositions, the relentless, polyrhythmic funk of drummer Gene Lake and bassist Brad Jones, the Sun-Ra-esque sonics of Adam Benjamin who plays a highly modulated Fender Rhodes and the post-post blowing of the front line featuring Douglas and saxophonist Marcus Strickland. But what puts this one over the top is the true integration of a DJ, in this case DJ Olive, into the constantly shifting improvisations of a cutting edge band. Rolling Stone called Keystone’s 2005′s self titled album, “a modernist requiem.” Moonshine takes it a step further: a modernist recipe for the future sound of electronics, jazz, and new composition.",

The themes, penned by Douglas for his Grammy-nominated band Keystone, integrate electronics seamlessly into the improvised music, piecing sounds and movement together to make three strikingly different Creatures. \n\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK is literally the soundtrack to the film by Bill Morrison. \n\nEXPAND contains the ‘straight’ performances of themes written for the film. \n\nBURST includes themes recorded at the session that did not appear in the film.\n\n\n\nThis is the complete trilogy of music written for Spark of Being, the film by Bill Morrison.",

Fresh off of their 2006 release, Moonshine, this group took to the stage at the famous Jazz Standard in New York, New York for 4 consecutive nights playing 2 sets per night.\n\n\n\nWith plenty of ear-bending sonics and relentless polyrhythmic funk, these performances twist and turn Douglas’ silent era-inspired compositions in ways that only a live performance would allow. The band debuted new compositions by Douglas, and played music from Dave’s 2003 release, Freak In, on top of the Keystone song book.",

This project represents the broadest documentation of this critically acclaimed band to date. Each set, 60 minutes in length, features a unique combination of compositions and improvisations culled from previous albums The Infinite (2001), Strange Liberation (2003) and Meaning and Mystery (2006), as well as a book of new pieces recently road-tested on the Quintet’s November, 2006 European tour. In all, Douglas recorded 40 different compositions, old and new. Live at The Jazz Standard represents an incredible addition to the ouevre of the Grammy nominated Dave Douglas Quintet.",

      "about": "In a brilliant stroke of tour routing, this gig at the Umea Jazz Festival in northern Sweden was immediately preceded by the San Francisco jazz festival in California and followed by one in Cormons, Italy. Nonetheless everyone came ready to play. The Keystone sound really came together here: sloppy and wild, but also focused, lyrical, delicate, and at times simply bizarre. Also, like the films it was written to, it was a lot of fun. The concert began with a showing of Fatty and Mabel Adrift, Roscoe Arbuckle's 1915 three-reeler, probably the first (and finest?) surreal comico-psychological thriller drama. Next, we played the three main themes from my score for Mabel and Fatty's Wash Day (in which the perennial slapstick potential of the laundry line is used to address some semi-serious marital issues) without accompanying the film. Finally, as an encore, we played Luke the Dog, written to the heroic canine suspense vehicle, Fatty's Plucky Pup. Though we edited the chit chat and whatnot, this is the way the gig was played. Thanks to Lars-Goran Ulander of Swedish Radio 2 for making this release possible. -Dave Douglas",

      "about": "Meaning and Mystery is the third album from the Dave Douglas Quintet and first for the Greenleaf Music label. It follows 2004’s critically-acclaimed Strange Liberation and 2002’s Grammy-nominated The Infinite in building upon and establishing Douglas’ version of a modern living jazz quintet music. \n\n\n\nInspired by Miles Davis, the current work of the Wayne Shorter Quartet as well as more obscure groups such as those led by Julius Hemphill and Baikida Carroll to name a few, the album’s nine dynamic Douglas compositions reflect Douglas’ fascination with the worlds of poetry, visual arts, architecture, dance and film. Except for tenor saxophonist Donny McCaslin, who joined the quintet in 2005, each member of the group has played with Douglas for an extended period of time. Uri Caine (Fender Rhodes) has been with Douglas for fifteen years, bassist James Genus for over ten years, and drummer Clarence Penn for over six years. Each group member is a master musician with a clear and distinctive voice; Douglas wouldn’t have it any other way. “I like to hear individual expression, even in a group setting,” says Douglas. “I tried to write songs that could be approached with – that invite – personality, expressiveness, immediacy.” \n\n\n\nWith Meaning and Mystery, he has accomplished this goal and delivered an album of astonishing virtuosity and artistic vision.\n\n\n\nLiner notes:\n\n\n\nMusic goes by fast. Listeners who know the first two recordings of this Quintet will note that this is a considerably different vision of this band. \n\n\n\nFirst of all there's Donny McCaslin, new to the band on this recording. He is a master of the tenor, as evidenced on Culture Wars, on the Sheik, and especially on Elk's Club where he just steams through the form of the tune. Donny is a complete musician -- he played his first concert in the band without a rehearsal or even a sound check (though it wasn't planned that way). His thorough internalizing of the music was obvious to all of us right away. His sound has become a part of the band and now has a part in shaping the band. \n\n\n\nUri Caine plays fender rhodes here, and something bugs me when it's talked about like a period instrument. It's as if no new music had been written for harpsichord since the 17th century, like it's some kind of throwback or freak show. The way Uri Caine plays the rhodes makes it very much alive. The rich ringing tone and the warm sustain of the instrument give it a magical blend with the bass and drums. It's a unique blend that flows from Uri's sensitive and tasteful hands.\n\n\n\nAnother crucial part of that blend is bassist James Genus. If he didn't play so many kinds of music this band wouldn't sound the way it does. The way James plays the bass line on Culture Wars simply makes me feel like playing. Plus he has to navigate getting that enormous instrument through the airports. He probably manages it the same way he holds down these grooves: he's unstoppable.\n\n\n\nDrummer Clarence Penn knocked over his cymbal during The Sheik. It landed on the beat. You can hear it on this record at the end of his drum solo, and I still can't believe we played the melody after that. Clarence plays time in so many ways, you sometimes don't notice until it's too late. For example, at the beginning of this record he plays Painter's Way with at least a dozen shades of three. It's that flexibility that makes Clarence one of the most in-demand drummers in the business.\n\n\n\nIt should be obvious to anyone who has heard this quintet that I love Miles Davis, and when someone says I'm influenced by Miles Davis I'm flattered. But aren't we all influenced? Anyone involved in American music has to at some point deal with the language of jazz. Who could be more central to the modern vision of the music? \n\n\n\nAnd as a jumping-off point for new quintet music what better place is there to start? There is room to grow from Davis' music because he created so many open roads. The many modes are loved and vilified, part of a legacy that still provokes inspiration and controversy. But the message in my opinion was not to stop there, but to keep growing, exploring and changing the sound and the context.\n\n\n\nThere are many others who's music has helped shape this quintet music: from the great Lee Morgan quintets, to Joe Henderson / Woody Shaw groups, to Cannonball and Nat Adderley, to Anthony Braxton / Kenny Wheeler, Julius Hemphill / Baikida Carroll, Tim Berne / Herb Robertson. Many of these groups are not given appropriate credit for the great expansions in music of the past decades.\n\n\n\nThis is far from an exclusive list -- this form of ensemble music is alive and well in the twenty-first century. It's not a throwback, it keeps growing forward. Wayne Shorter's recent small group has been a revelation: he continues to question everything -- to put everything at risk. And in so doing he forges new pathways in music. Hearing the way they play has been enlightening and has meant a great deal to me. \n\n\n\nWriting these songs suggested new ways of thinking about all of that. Of course all the influences of the recent past are here. But I feel there's something universal in creating songs that hold up under reinterpretation. Songs that can be approached with -- that invite -- personality, expressiveness, immediacy.\n\n\n\nLooking to liner notes for an explanation of music is like watching Breakfast at Tiffany's to find a good omelet recipe. The attempt to pin it down makes me feel like the poor tour guide on top of a double-decker bus in Times Square while the ball drops at New Year's. Music goes by that fast and it's shaped by so many other forces: relationships to poetry, to the visual arts, to dance and architecture and film. Music is crucial only inasmuch as it relates to life and culture. Jazz is definitely alive, it's vibrant and it's vital. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes it's nonsense. But in the search for truth it is always bearing new fruit.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas\n\nMarch 2006",

Greenleaf Music recorded all 12 sets the group played that week and released each set within 24 hours as downloadable MP3s. The project represented the broadest documentation of the Grammy nominated group to date and featured a unique combination of compositions and improvisations culled from previous albums culled from previous albums The Infinite (2001), Strange Liberation (2003) and Meaning and Mystery (2006), as well as a book of new pieces recently road-tested on the Quintet's November, 2006 European tour. \n\n\n\nAfter repeated requests from fans, Douglas and Greenleaf decided to change course and release some of this extraordinary music on CD in a double disc set appropriately titled, Dave Douglas Quintet, Live at the Jazz Standard. The discs include all of the new pieces and two older pieces never before heard on CD in a \"live\" format and in which the arrangement is significantly different from their studio renderings.",

      "about": "Nominated for GRAMMY for 'Best Contemporary Jazz Album' in 2005, Keystone features Douglas compositions inspired by the great and unfairly maligned Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle, one of America’s earliest and funniest movie stars. Focusing on his early works for the Keystone production company (1915-1916), the new music attempts to mirror the humor and drama, the tragedy and hilarity of Arbuckle’s films and his life. The electric invoked scores are warm, funny, funky, and experimental, perfectly capturing the atmosphere of the films.\n\n\n\nKeystone is a two-disc release: a CD and a DVD. The CD contains eleven music tracks which present themes Dave Douglas composed for Arbuckle’s films. The DVD contains two items; first, Roscoe Arbuckle’s 1915 film “Fatty and Mabel Adrift”, accompanied by Dave Douglas’ new score (comprised of the above-mentioned songs plus about seven minutes of additional music Dave wrote for this film). Also included is “Just Another Murder”, a music video for this Keystone track compiled and edited from the film “Fatty’s Tin-Type Tangle”, directed by Arbuckle in 1915.\n\n\n\nLiner notes:\n\n\n\nLife is a tight rope. We never know when we're going to fall or how far. Some never do. Some ride the edge for the longest time, always pushing the boundaries and giving us a glimpse of immortality. Others shine for a brief moment only to be destroyed.\n\n\n\nOf the many celebrity trials we have witnessed in the last century, one of the most tragic and unfair was also one of the first. It was the trial that caused Roscoe Arbuckle's third jury, after deliberating a total of six minutes, to issue him this extraordinary apology:\n\n\n\n\"Acquittal is not enough for Roscoe Arbuckle. We feel that a great injustice has been done. We also feel that is was only our plain duty to give him this exoneration. We wish him success and hope that the American people will take the judgement of 14 men and women who have sat listening for 31 days to the evidence that Roscoe Arbuckle is entirely innocent and free from blame.\"\n\n\n\nAt the height of a brilliant, innovative creative career, one of the best paid entertainers in the country, in 1921 Arbuckle was destroyed by the scandal (with the collusion, it seems, of the studio heads) and never regained his place as a pioneering film maker and funny man. A few friends, Buster Keaton, Mabel Normand, and his wife, Minta Durfee, stuck by him and pestered the studios to put him back to work. But his films were removed from circulation and only the darkest rumors persisted, even to this day.\n\n\n\nRoscoe Arbuckle (born March 24, 18...) lived a tough life. He did not like being called Fatty. He seems to have wished he could slip out of the fat suit the way Chaplin slipped out of his oversized suit (initially lent to him by Arbuckle, the suit became Chaplin's trademark). By all reports a sweet, funny, private man, his films spoke to me when I was researching early silent film history. I like these early films the most because it seems as if the telling of the tale is more important than the tale itself. You can watch an Arbuckle short, thoroughly enjoy it, and then find yourself asking: What just happened?\n\n\n\nThere is a levity and a fast pace to his work that made me feel it would work modern music. Fatty and Mabel Adrift, shot in 1915, was on the cutting edge of narrative filmmaking. The technology was exciting and new. It must have been a thrill to come to work each day and dream up new scenarios and new ways of capturing them. In a way, working with electronic music I feel in the same situation.\n\n\n\nThese scores are meant to evoke the atmospheres and feelings in Roscoe's early work. Innocence, caring, devotion, and a wicked, winking sense of humor and the absurd. On the DVD side, my music is timed up to the film. On the CD side the pieces are represented in their entirety.\n\n\n\nI personally have to thank Jon Yanofsky at The Paramount Center of the Arts, housed in an old movie house in Peekskill, NY, for asking me long ago to initiate this project.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas, June, 2005",

      "about": "Released on Premonition Records in 2004, Bow River Falls was recorded in a single afternoon at The Banff Centre in June 2003. This was truly a meeting of musicians — each a member of the faculty at the 2002 Banff International Workshop in Jazz and Creative Music, each bringing compositions/arrangements to this book of music. Released in 2004 on Premonition Records, this stands as Douglas’ first release after his departure from RCA just prior to starting his own label, Greenleaf Music.\n\n\n\nLiner notes:\n\n\n\nSo little can be said about music without trampling it underfoot. In music we escape the real world. For as long as the music lasts we live in the sound, in a world that has no physical existence. Conversely, music also brings us more into the world by pointing out the mysteries in life and human experience. Why are we here? What are our relationships to each other? How do we handle ourselves? What is universal truth? I fell that what can be said about music merely helps to put it in a context. Here is some information about the human side of this recording, and how Bow River Falls came about.\n\n\n\nThis was a true meeting of musicians. First brought together as a quartet by Ken Pickering at the Vancouver Jazz Festival in 1998, each of us subsequently met up in various situations, none documented on record. Louis invited me a few times to join his remarkable quintet in France. Peggy and Dylan, central to the vital creative music scene in Vancouver, both joined a project that I call Mountain Passages. Our first gig involve a hike to 9,000 feet in the Italian Dolomites. Needless to say, there was no recording equipment available.\n\n\n\nWhen pianist Kenny Werner offered me the job as the director of the Banff Workshop in 2002, Peggy and Dylan were the first two musicians I called to join the faculty. It was amazing to spend a few weeks with them and their sons Curtis and Dexter in the dry mountain air of Banff National Park. With the generous help of the French consulate, we were also able to bring Louis to participate in the the workshop.\n\n\n\nOne of the most unexpected surprises at Banff is the existence, within all that wildness (bears, elk, etc.), of a state of the art recording studio. With the assistance of Banff Audio Department, we took an afternoon to put this recording together.\n\n\n\nIt was all agreed that all of us would contribute compositions and conceptions, making the project truly a cooperative effort. Though we did rehearse, these readings of each other's pieces retain a comfortable, spontaneous feeling. The instrumentation gave us an opportunity to add one of my favorite pieces by the great Steve Lacy, the catchy and infectious Blinks. Dylan's addition of laptop computer to his drum kit on several pieces seems to blend naturally with the acoustic instruments, while creating an otherworldly atmosphere on the title track, on Window, and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nSome of these pieces appear elsewhere in our discographies - for me that heightens the uniqueness of this meeting. From disparate parts of the globe, united in a remote location, for a few hours, the language of music overcomes all boundaries of communication.\n\n\n\nMusic speaks louder than words.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas\n\nMay, 2004",

      "about": "Continuing the innovative approach to tribute records he began in 1994 with the Booker Little homage In Our Lifetime, Douglas dedicates Stargazer to the great Wayne Shorter. Only three tracks, however, are Shorter compositions: “Pug Nose,” “On the Milky Way Express,” and “Diana.” The rest are Douglas originals that are inspired by Shorter, although Douglas is far too clever to make the inspiration obvious.\n\n\n\nOriginally released on Arabesque Recordings (AJ0132) in 1997.\n\n\n\nDave's liner notes:\n\n\n\nStargazer pays homage to Wayne Shorter, composer, saxophonist, and one of the greatest innovators of 20th century music. It is the second studio recording of this group, our first one was 'In Our Lifetime,' a 1994 tribute to trumpeter / composer Booker Little.\n\n\n\nWayne Shorter's open mind and creative genius has made him a constant presence on the forefront of composed and improvised music for four decades - decades marked by rapid and radical changes in society, music, and art. His intense melodic gift, rhythmic ingenuity, harmonic sophistication and sublime sense of structure are some of the elements in his music that have particularly touched me. There is an ever-present warmth and humanity in his music that I find mirrored in his writing and his approach to life and art. His music seems to ask us to abandon our hangups and preoccupations with stylistic limitations and other barriers to direct communication. When you look at the full range of his output it's truly amazing to take in the enormous breadth of what he has done. All of the many phases of his career have inspired my work and the compositions I've written for this album reflect that inspiration. It is with profound respect that I dedicate them to him.\n\n\n\nAs for the compositions on this disc: \"Pug Nose\" is the earliest one, dating from 1959's 'Introducing Wayne Shorter' on Veejay. \"Diana\" was recorded for the Columbia album 'Native Dancer' in 1974 and again this year on '1 + 1,' the duo recording with Herbie Hancock. \"On the Milky Way Express\" appears on 'High Life,' released in 1995. Check out the originals and any of his many other recordings now thankfully available on CD. Also look out for new works as Shorter remains an important and sometimes controversial figure in the art of music.\n\n\n\nDave Douglas, June, 1997",

      "about": "Dave Douglas’ Mountain Passages is an album of music inspired by the myths and the spirit of rural mountain culture. The first live performance of the material, which features Dave’s band NOMAD, took place high in the Italian Dolomites, as part of the festival I Suoni delle Dolomitti. Partially inspired by Douglas’ love of world folk music, Mountain Passages also carries the spirit of jazz that informs all of Dave’s music. The record is a profound and playful mix that veers between the solemnity of solitary contemplation and the drunken debauchery of ecstatic celebration. The ensemble of trumpet, clarinet, cello, tuba and percussion, envisioned as an imaginary traveling band, play 12 stunning new Douglas compositions making Mountain Passages Douglas’ most emotive new work since the very popular “Charms of the Night Sky” recording.\n\n\n\nDave's program notes:\n\n\n\nWhat is it? The festival at The Sound of the Dolomites asked me to write music which would be played between nine and twelve thousand feet. And they told me we'd be hiking. They also sent a recording of their local Ladino music. Like all great music it raised more questions than it answered, but it seemed to veer between solemn devotional calmness and riotous drunken celebration.\n\n\n\nThis seemed like an imaginary gig, imaginary mountain music, until it happened: in the middle of August 2003 all of us hiked up to Rifugio Boè in Valle di Fassa and the Rifugio Brentei neat Madonna di Campilglio. And played this music for hundreds of fans who had hiked up to hear us. It was one of the most exhilarating musical experiences I've ever had.\n\n\n\nMy father was a mountain runner and map maker, and in 1980 he wrote a letter to the Woodstock Times defending his passion against those who thought it was unseemly to be running over the trails. I think he would have enjoyed this music. I wrote it with him in mind. Sadly, he never got to hear it, leaving this earth less than a month after the premiere. I think he was probably pleased the way he went - quickly, doing what he lover most. In many ways, this music is for Damon.",

On film, it stands as a reinterpretation of that Frankenstein myth using new, archival, and distressed footage.

      "about": "Dave Douglas’ Tiny Bell Trio is one of his most intriguing groups, a band consisting of the leader’s trumpet, guitarist Brad Schoeppach, and drummer Jim Black. Due to Schoeppach’s versatility, Douglas’ inventive originals (only a Hungarian folk song and a classical melody from Robert Schumann are not by the trumpeter) and the interplay between the musicians, this project is a strong success. The music often looks towards Eastern Europe folk melodies but maintains its ties with American jazz and is full of constant surprises. One of four Arabesque masters whose ownership recently reverted back to Douglas",

      "about": "On April 24th, 2010, Dave Douglas and experimental filmmaker Bill Morrison unveiled their multimedia collaboration, Spark Of Being, at Stanford University. On film, it stands as a reinterpretation of that Frankenstein myth using new, archival, and distressed footage. The themes, penned by Douglas for his Grammy-nominated band Keystone, integrate electronics seamlessly into the improvised music, piecing sounds and movement together to make three strikingly different Creatures.\n\n\n\nSOUNDTRACK is literally the soundtrack to the film by Bill Morrison.\n\nEXPAND contains the ‘straight’ performances of themes written for the film.\n\nBURST includes themes recorded at the session that did not appear in the film.",
