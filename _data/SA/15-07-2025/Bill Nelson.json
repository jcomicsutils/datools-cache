      "about": "'A Catalogue Of Obsessions' was originally released in 1985, the final piece of the 4-LP box set 'Trial By Intimacy (The Book Of Splendours)'.\n\nThen released for the first time on CD in 1989.\n\n\n\n\"These were all recorded on very simple equipment, (which is all I had at the time), hence the 'home hobbyist' sound. They were created over a few months, rather than years, if my memory serves me. As always, the titles play an important role in how I intend the music to be heard. They set up a context, an anticipation and an imaginary or real environment for the music to unfold in.\"\n\n\n\nThis digital download includes CD artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews please visit:  www.billnelson.com/trial-by-intimacy",

      "about": "Simplex is an instrumental album containing mainly short-form keyboard-based instrumental pieces.\n\nOriginally released on CD (without Bill's permission) in 1990, this digital download version contains five bonus tracks which were recorded during those same sessions, but until now have never been released! \n\n\n\n\"During the latter part of the nineteen eighties, I was commissioned by The Henry Moore Foundation to compose the soundtrack to a film examining the sculptor’s work in relation to the landscape.\n\nThe film, directed by Murray Grigor and called simply 'Henry Moore and Landscape', was a joy to work on. \n\nI decided to release some of this music, along with various complementary compositions, as an album which I titled 'Simplex'.\n\n\n\n\"Simplex contains only a fraction of the music I made for the film it isn't meant to be a soundtrack album as such, the vast majority of the music on the album was created quite separately from the film's soundtrack and has no real connection with the documentary. However, the recordings were made in a similar frame of mind and could be said to be in the same short-form, minimalist style.\n\n\n\n\"Of the many purely instrumental albums I have recorded, “Simplex” is one of my favourites.\n\nIt is, in essence, a collection of miniatures, a box of sonic jewellery…\"\n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with printable PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, visit the album's page on Dreamsville:  www.billnelson.com/simplex",

      "about": "This recording takes us right back to the beginning...\n\nNorthern Dream is the debut album from Bill Nelson, recorded at Holyground Studios in Wakefield, and released independently on Smile Records in 1971. \n\nHolyground was an independent studio run by local music enthusiast Mike Levon.\n\nThe Northern Dream album was financed by a couple of Bill's friends (Ken and Betty Bromby), who owned and ran a small record shop, The Record Bar, in Wakefield.\n\nNorthern Dream first appeared on CD in 1996.\n\n\n\n\"Northern Dream also made the Wakefield Express's columns. There was a feature in the paper about it, with a photo of me under the headline: \"Local Government Officer Makes LP\". \n\nOf course, John Peel eventually played the album on his radio show and raved about it. The first time he played it, he played every track in sequence, with just a break to turn the disc over. It was an amazing thing for me...I'd listened to John's programmes for a long time and loved the sort of things he played. To have my entire first, 'home made' album played from start to finish by him was a tremendously exciting honour.\n\n\n\n\"I owe my career, such as it is, to John Peel. He was so important in bringing Northern Dream to a radio audience and ultimately the attention of EMI Records who, after some deliberation, agreed to sign my band Be Bop Deluxe to the Harvest Label, (though they were initially only wanting to sign myself as a solo artist).\"\n\n\n\nThis digital download includes CD artwork and lyrics as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information please visit:  www.billnelson.com/northern-dream",

      "about": "Astroloops was originally released in January 2015 as a CDR release issued in a very limited edition (just 24 copies) to purchasers of the Astroluxe Custom Ltd. guitar produced by Eastwood Guitars. \n\nDue to the nature of this extremely limited edition release, Astroloops is one of the rarest of all of Bill's albums.\n\n\n\n\"Astroloops is an album of instrumental improvisations based on looped guitar patterns.\n\nMy own prototype 'Astroluxe' guitar has been used to record the album and all the guitar parts you will hear are performed exclusively on that instrument. There are no keyboards, bass or percussion overdubs on these recordings, (with the exception of a couple of tracks where extremely minimal use of keyboard has been added).\n\n\n\n\"All the guitar sounds were processed via a Fractal Audio Axe-FX digital device and a first generation Line 6 Pod 2 modeller, recording direct to a Mackie HDR 24/96 digital multitrack machine.\n\n\n\n\"The music was created spontaneously and offers a glimpse of the raw first-take, stream of consciousness approach that often provides the foundation for my more commercially available work. In this instance, however, I've resisted the temptation to attempt perfection or modify/flatter the recording and instead allowed its inherent flaws to become a component of the music itself. \n\nI hope you will enjoy this private peep behind the magic curtain!\"\n\n\n\nThe digital download comes complete with artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further album details visit the discography on the official Bill Nelson website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/astroloops",

      "about": "Originally released on CD in 1995 by Voiceprint's Resurgence Records, the album contained just a single 30 minute-long minimalist ambient track, which was repeated on the disc.\n\n\n\nThis download contains the original track, plus two bonus tracks, which have never previously been released, taking the overall running time to over an hour.\n\n\n\n\"Towards the end of 1993, I was invited by Rob Ward to create a piece of music for his installation ‘Crimsworth’. The installation comprised a rectangular room, the walls of which were covered with a special ceramic paper, painted by the artist. The floor of the room was then flooded with water over which a long, narrow platform extended allowing the viewer to enter the centre of the space.\n\n\n\n\"The work was inspired by an area of landscape nearby the artist's home, known as Crimsworth. The music reflects this natural environment and is in turn refracted through Rob Ward's painting to create an elemental space pregnant with mystery and subterranean forces.\n\n\n\nBonus tracks:\n\n\" ‘Palace Of Gnosis’ - was recorded at The Echo Observatory in 1988 and written as a piece for guided meditation for the Rosicrucian Order (Ancient Mystical Order Rosea Crusis) that I was involved with at the time. \n\nI was actually master of the Leeds Rosicrucian Lodge back then and devised a spoken scenario that I would narrate live over the music. The idea was to guide the people meditating on a journey down a river to a beautiful palace where they would encounter several symbolic and mystical beings who would impart occult teachings to them. I understand that the meditators found it very effective.\n\n\n\n\" ‘Out Of The Window, Into The Night’ - was also recorded at The Echo Observatory, although a little earlier in 1985. It was originally intended as an opening sequence soundtrack to an animated film of Roald Dhal’s ‘The BFG’.\"\n\n\n\nFor further information please visit the album's page in the discography section of Dreamsville:  www.billnelson.com/crimsworth\n\n\n\n Album artwork PDF files are included with this download.",

      "about": "'After the Satellite Sings' was recorded at Fairview Studios over the Winter of 1995 to produce what would be Bill's final album recorded in a commercial studio. After this, all of his solo output would come from his domestic recording set-up. The album is predominantly a vocal album that crosses several styles, including the then emerging drum 'n' bass genre that was a dominant part of the dance music scene in the '90s.\n\n\n\nThis digital download release includes two previously unreleased tracks...\n\nTwo versions of the track 'Ordinary Idiots' - one of them is Bill's original demo of the song, the second is a live version performed at Nelsonica 03 by Bill's band at the time, The Lost Satellites.\n\n\n\n\"After the Satellite Sings is one of my favourite albums. In fact it functions as a key element amongst my recorded work and is an album that has apparently inspired other artists....Which is nice!\n\nI had a great time making this album and it features some new departures for me. The whole project was written, performed, recorded and mixed in an intense 28 day session at Fairview studios, and despite the short amount of time available in the studio, I'm very pleased with the outcome.\"\n\n\n\nThe download includes full album artwork as printable PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews visit the album's page in the Dreamsville discography:  www.billnelson.com/after-the-satellite-sings",

Because of the relationship's covert nature, instrumentals were often more appropriate than lyrics, (which may have been too revealing). But \"Les Amoureux\" is a particular example of that inspiration, though there are many others...\"\n\n\n\nThis digital download includes CD artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews please visit:  www.billnelson.com/trial-by-intimacy",

      "about": "The Two-Fold Aspect of Everything was initially issued in 1985 as a double album on vinyl on Cocteau Records. \n\nThe double vinyl was condensed into a single CD for UK release in 1989.\n\n\n\nTracks 1 - 10 are taken from the first of these, ‘Eaux d’artifice’, a collection of B-sides and rarities which had previously never been available on an album, and which had (at the time) never been presented in compact disc form.\n\nTracks 11 - 22 comprised the ‘Confessions Of A Four-Track Mind’ LP, made up of domestically recorded four-track demo tapes, which due to a lack of time, were never developed further. \n\nAlthough their technical qualities are somewhat dubious, these songs are presented in their charmingly naive and natural state.\n\n\n\nThe download includes printable album artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further details follow the link to the album's page on Dreamsville:  www.billnelson.com/two-fold-aspect",

They were created over a few months, rather than years, if my memory serves me. As always, the titles play an important role in how I intend the music to be heard. They set up a context, an anticipation and an imaginary or real environment for the music to unfold in.\"\n\n\n\nThis digital download includes CD artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews please visit:  www.billnelson.com/trial-by-intimacy",

Amongst these was a track titled 'Drive Shaft' which I considered too brash for The Jewel, but too good to abandon. I decided to create a suitable album to house 'Drive Shaft' and Powertron was the result. It's an album of left-field rock songs, mainly vocal but layered with loud and edgy guitars. It will appeal to those who enjoy the wilder side of my work.\"\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further information visit:  www.billnelson.com/powertron",

      "about": "'Juke Box For Jet Boy' is the final album from the 4-CD box set 'My Secret Studio (Vol.1)', originally released in 1995. \n\nThe tracks contained within all 4 albums were compiled from a vast archive of previously unreleased recordings made between 1988 and 1992. \n\n\n\n\"Between the years 1988 and 1992 my life underwent some severe changes…both emotional and financial. During that time I used my home studios to create sketches of songs for further development with a projected band. The band, for various and nefarious reasons, never materialized. These ‘demos’ are all that remain of my hopes, fears and dreams from that period. Each song was created in the space of a couple of hours, composing spontaneously to tape. There were no attempts to ‘polish’ the material. What you will hear is the raw stuff of dreams, instant songwriting with a vengeance. Nothing here is state-of-the-art, merely ‘state-of-the-heart’. In 1995 I spent a considerable amount of time choosing material from these archives to assemble as an outgoing series of very personal albums. ‘MY SECRET STUDIO’ is the end result of that work, distilled from over 300 recordings. That fountain still flows and there will be more albums to follow…I hope you will find something here to enjoy.\" \n\n\n\nBill Nelson July 1995 \n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with album artwork. \n\nFor further information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/my-secret-studio",

      "about": "'Electricity Made Us Angels' is the second album from the 4-CD box set 'My Secret Studio (Vol.1)', originally released in 1995. \n\nThe tracks contained within all 4 albums were compiled from a vast archive of previously unreleased recordings made between 1988 and 1992. \n\n\n\n\"Between the years 1988 and 1992 my life underwent some severe changes…both emotional and financial. During that time I used my home studios to create sketches of songs for further development with a projected band. The band, for various and nefarious reasons, never materialized. These ‘demos’ are all that remain of my hopes, fears and dreams from that period. Each song was created in the space of a couple of hours, composing spontaneously to tape. There were no attempts to ‘polish’ the material. What you will hear is the raw stuff of dreams, instant songwriting with a vengeance. Nothing here is state-of-the-art, merely ‘state-of-the-heart’. In 1995 I spent a considerable amount of time choosing material from these archives to assemble as an outgoing series of very personal albums. ‘MY SECRET STUDIO’ is the end result of that work, distilled from over 300 recordings. That fountain still flows and there will be more albums to follow…I hope you will find something here to enjoy.\" \n\n\n\nBill Nelson July 1995 \n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with album artwork. \n\nFor further information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/my-secret-studio",

      "about": "\"The tracks on ‘Starlight Stories’ were recorded during the same 2022 recording sessions that produced tracks for the ‘All The Fun Of The Fair’ album. However, ‘Starlight Stories’ has a quite different atmosphere and intent.\n\n\n\nThe inspiration for many of the songs came from my memories of a set of children’s story books, published in the 1920s, that my Mother had owned when she was a child in the early 1930s. She had kept these books and would read to me from them when I was an infant in the early 1950s. They were thick, heavy bound books with embossed covers and had titles such as ‘The Golden Wonder Book For Children’. They were brilliantly illustrated by artists who displayed a combination of Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles. The books contained stories by famous authors such as HG Wells, Miguel De Cervantes, Homer, William Blake and others, plus poems by various poets, both classical and contemporary to those times. I was entranced by the wonderful stories and illustrations they contained. They had an aura of magic and mystery about them, with fairy tales and evocatively British poetry, filled with seasonal and rustic imagery. A treasure trove of fantasy and adventure, which I loved.\n\n\n\n‘Starlight Stories’ doesn’t attempt to directly portray those old books but it does try to capture some of their atmosphere and manifest my nostalgia for them. Consequently the songs on this album have a softer, melancholic quality about them, albeit with some distressed, patina-like textures that evoke the scent and feel of those old books. They are dreamy meditations, wistful reveries fed through the filter of my contemporary musical sensibility. I hope they will, in some small way, connect you with your own lost story books, as well as with mine.\" - Bill Nelson 2023.\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with printable artwork as PDF files. \n\nFor further information, please visit the album's page in the discography section of Bill's website -  www.billnelson.com/starlight-stories",

For this I offer no apology as the music owes its existence to a very personal and selfish obsession. As a direct result, some pieces will require a little patience.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nAs always, this download comes with PDF artwork.\n\nFor further information check out  www.billnelson.com/sounding-the-ritual-echo",

      "about": "'Chamber Of Dreams (Music from the Invisibility Exhibition)' was originally released in 1985, the second of the 4-LP box set 'Trial By Intimacy (The Book Of Splendours)'.\n\nThen released for the first time on CD in 1989.\n\n\n\n\"In 1981 and 1983, I organised a series of live performances under the general title of The Invisibility Exhibition. This event toured throughout Great Britain and included contributions from the Yorkshire Actors Company, Richard Jobson, Frank Chickens and David Claridge as well as myself and Ian Nelson.\n\n\n\nBesides theatre, poetry, mime, and musical performances, there were eight TV screens and one large movie screen on which were shown films by Jean Cocteau and Man Ray. My own musical contribution included live improvisation of guitar, percussion and synthesiser over pre-recorded tapes from the archives of the Echo Observatory. Chamber of Dreams presents two facets of this event.\n\n\n\nTracks 1-9 is a selection of the ‘backing tapes’ which were used as a basis for my own performance. They are presented here in their virgin state without any live improvisation. Musicians owning this album, might enjoy sketching their own ideas over these tracks in the privacy of their own home.\n\n\n\nTracks 10-18 represents a selection of the interval music which was played between the various performances during the Exhibition itself. These are complete and were not intended as part of the improvisational work.\n\n\n\nFor those who attended the performances, this record is intended as a souvenir for the ear. For those who missed the Invisibility Exhibition perhaps Chamber of Dreams will make you curious enough to attend the next one.\"\n\n\n\nThis digital download includes CD artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews please visit:  www.billnelson.com/trial-by-intimacy",

      "about": "Originally released as a double vinyl album in 1987, which included a 7\" bonus EP.\n\nThe 2CD version appeared the following year, which included 14 bonus tracks.\n\nThe full collection of tracks are included in this download.\n\n\n\n\"The music presented on these 2 albums marks the consolidation of several years of musical & philosophical practice. Almost every piece was conceived during moments of intense stillness or 'magical vacuity'.\n\nFor this I acknowledge the influence of the late Austin Osman Spare, whose technique for creating 'automatic drawing' has found a sympathetic resonance in my own work.\n\nOf all the music I have made, this is, perhaps, the most personal & yet the least demonstrative. Attempting nothing & existing purely for itself, it is, nevertheless, a practical music, ideally suited to the occultist in search of ritual atmosphere or serene meditation.\n\nWith such a purpose in mind I offer this work to my fellow initiates as a testament to the Gnosis & a confirmation of The World Within.\" - Bill Nelson 1987\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with album artwork.\n\nFor further info and fan reviews please go to -  www.billnelson.com/chance-encounters-garden-of-lights",

      "about": "'Deep Dream Decoder' is the third album from the 4-CD box set 'My Secret Studio (Vol.1)', originally released in 1995. \n\nThe tracks contained within all 4 albums were compiled from a vast archive of previously unreleased recordings made between 1988 and 1992. \n\n\n\n\"Between the years 1988 and 1992 my life underwent some severe changes…both emotional and financial. During that time I used my home studios to create sketches of songs for further development with a projected band. The band, for various and nefarious reasons, never materialized. These ‘demos’ are all that remain of my hopes, fears and dreams from that period. Each song was created in the space of a couple of hours, composing spontaneously to tape. There were no attempts to ‘polish’ the material. What you will hear is the raw stuff of dreams, instant songwriting with a vengeance. Nothing here is state-of-the-art, merely ‘state-of-the-heart’. In 1995 I spent a considerable amount of time choosing material from these archives to assemble as an outgoing series of very personal albums. ‘MY SECRET STUDIO’ is the end result of that work, distilled from over 300 recordings. That fountain still flows and there will be more albums to follow…I hope you will find something here to enjoy.\" \n\n\n\nBill Nelson July 1995 \n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with album artwork. \n\nFor further information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/my-secret-studio",

      "about": "First released in 1990, 'Nudity' is the second album from the 4-CD box set 'Demonstrations Of Affection'. \n\n\n\n\"It's a fairly straight, song-oriented set of albums with pop overtones rather than an experimental/abstract instrumental affair. Of course many of the songs dealt with an uncomfortable time in my life when I was troubled by marriage breakdown and management/financial problems...I guess the music was, in some instances, a cathartic response to this and could be interpreted as a involuntary expression of personal angst. But, it has what I'd consider some nice songs on it, emotional and direct.\" \n\n\n\nComplete with downloadable PDF artwork... \n\n\n\nFor further information visit  www.billnelson.com/demostrations-affection",

The result is a kind of 'Sonic Snapshot'... an idea frozen in time at its moment of conception.\n\nWhilst there was no pre-determined form for these pieces, I nevertheless tried to retain a sense of lightness and playfulness... like a boy having fun with his toys on a rainy day. These recordings are neither high-fidelity nor low-fidelity but simply true to the moment, and for me, that moment is always changing.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThe download, as always, comes with album artwork as PDF files. \n\nPlease visit  www.billnelson.com/confessions-hyperdreamer  for further details and fan reviews.",

      "about": "First released on CD in September 1998.\n\n\n\n\"Atom Shop was recorded at home on my old analogue 16 track system and the songs were originally intended as demos as I had hoped to re-record them with Mitchell Froom producing, (another tremendous world-class record producer). Mitchell told me that I'd be wasting my money employing a producer for those recordings as I'd got the songs to work in exactly the way they needed to.\n\nIn terms of the actual recordings, though, that 'demo' thing can be psychologically misleading, (as I've come to realise over the years). It's both a relative and a subjective term. What I personally think of as 'demos', others might think of as finished pieces and vice-versa. It's sometimes entirely dependent upon just how I describe them in my sleeve notes or in interviews. Minds are soft and vulnerable and, as William Burroughs once said, 'words are a virus.' \"\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with PDF files of the album artwork.\n\nFor further information visit the album's webpage:  www.billnelson.com/atom-shop",

      "about": "First released on CD in 2010, Picture Post was created from the soundtrack that Bill was commissioned to write for a documentary called American Stamps, broadcast by the PBS channel.\n\n\n\n\"Those of you who managed to catch the documentary television film the music was created for will have had a taster already, but the album presents the soundtrack in full focus without the documentary voice-over/narrative necessary to the film version.\n\nIt's an album of 'miniatures', 22 short pieces of very detailed, lush sounding instrumental music. The closest I can get to describing it is to say that it combines the keyboard approach of 'Theatre of Falling Leaves' with some of the orchestral textures of 'The Alchemical Adventures of Sailor Bill'. \n\nThis mixture is sprinkled here and there with electric guitar, sometimes in a slick, jazzy mood, sometimes in a chromium-plated, surf mood. There's also a touch of banjo and slide guitar. Oh, and a hint of electronica.\n\nIt's a very fine sounding album that conjures interesting pictures in the listener's mind and, as always, it offers a different approach to the previous album.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThe download comes with album artwork as PDF files.

It continues and develops the style of albums such as 'Quiet Bells' and 'Silvertone Fountains' but has its own distinct character.\n\nI hope you will enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with PDF artwork.\n\nFor further information go to the album's page at  www.billnelson.com/electra",

      "about": "Originally released on CD in August 2019...\n\n\n\n\"Stand By: Light Coming… is a 15 track, vocal-based album recorded in my home studio early in 2019. If there is a point of unity to the album’s diverse sounds, it could be said that it generally uses the enigmatic nature of 'time' as its theme. Images of watches and clocks abound in the lyrics which deal with the increasing rush of time and the rapid retreat of the past into nostalgia. Vocal and electric guitar-driven, it plots a path of aggressive melancholia and offers a meditation on impermanence.\" - Bill Nelson. June 2019.\n\n\n\nThe download comes with complete PDF artwork. \n\n\n\nFor further info, check out the album's page on Bill's website -  www.billnelson.com/stand-by-light-coming",

      "about": "Mainly vocal, with a few instrumental tracks, Old Haunts was originally released on CD in 2019.\n\n\n\n\"The starting point was to conjure up a state of beautiful decay, reverie and nostalgia. A twilight world where rain falls gently on rusty factories and streetlamps glow with pale light on abandoned avenues.\n\nOn first listen it may seem a bit 'darker' than previous albums, but it's a gentle darkness that sparkles with beautiful light. \n\nIt's a mature album in some ways, an 'adult' album for grown-ups who seek something with a little more depth and self-reflection, rather than the more 'la-la-la' dancing around your handbag stuff.\n\nIt's simply a message from the heart and where I am at this particular point in time, as all my albums are. Just another statement of the here and now, a diary entry, a mark on the calendar. It goes on, ever forward and always in flux...\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with album artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further information, visit the album's page in the discography on 'Dreamsville' -  www.billnelson.com/old-haunts",

      "about": "'The Dreamshire Chronicles' is a double album mixing vocal and instrumental pieces, first released on CD in November 2012.\n\n\n\n\"It contains a wide variety of styles, all of which have proved popular with many fans these last ten or fifteen years...and every track sounds, I'd say, just like 'me'.\n\nThe only way to describe it is for you to hear it. It's a cornucopia type of album, mixing styles and genres as if they were ingredients in a sonic cocktail. A track may start out in one mood but mutate through several others to end in a completely different place. It's music to listen to and follow as if you were reading an adventure story.\n\n'Dreamshire' is richly blessed with golden and beautifully artificial orchestras. The whole kit n' imaginary caboodle! It also has warped blues guitars, sublime jazz guitars, ambient keyboards, broken beats, ethereal loops, haunted lyrics and oblique arrangements. \n\nIt's not in the least 'experimental', as I know exactly what I'm doing with it...but it will challenge anyone who thinks a few synth bleeps equals adventure. \n\nThis is adult music and not a throwback to '80s big-shoulder, analogue fashion, or '70s rock guitar macho chest-beating histrionics. It will confuse the bejesus out of anyone expecting the obvious pop 'avant-garde' signifiers. (At least, that's what I'm hoping for...)\n\nSpeed of light, speed of sound, stand back, mind the blast! This will be a sublime listening experience for those whose lightbulb is switched on! It's neither experimental nor rock, it's kind of beyond those categories.\n\nIt's like a bunch of different coloured fireworks going off at once and I just enjoy the individual bangs and whooshes, then try to decipher patterns from it all later, when the smoke clears.\n\n'Dreamshire' isn't meant to be an exterior location...it's an inner landscape, located in some mysterious backwater of the mind, surreal and illogical.\n\n\n\n\"A thought struck me when I was listening through this album to prepare the listening notes: \n\nIf there was to be such a thing as a Bill Nelson 'steampunk' album, 'The Dreamshire Chronicles' might well qualify. There's something antiquated, rustic yet futuristic about this one, a kind of neo-Victorian rock n' roll, steam-powered guitar amps and Tesla-coil keyboards coupled with a symphony orchestra staffed by women in long leather dresses and tall hats. Patinated copper pipe flutes and oboes, drums fashioned from old stoves and railway engine boilers, guitars that resemble a cross between crystal sets and concert harps. Everything lit by candlelight.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nArtwork files and Bill's album 'Listening Notes' are included with this download.\n\n\n\nFor further album information, visit  www.billnelson.com/dreamshire-chronicles",

      "about": "​\"'Marvellous Realms' emerges from another intensive, almost perpetual, recording session. The studio is my favoured outlet for my creative endeavours, (and perhaps has always been so), especially having now forsaken live performances due to various unwelcome health concerns .\n\n\n\nCreating music in my modest home studio is an absolute joy, never a chore. I'm constantly exploring an evolving and very personal universe of sounds, concepts, thoughts and whimsical imaginings. Dreaming whilst awake perhaps, ongoing real time fantasias, embracing both the past and the future with equal enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nFrom the latest batch of 80 or so new recordings comes this album, 'Marvellous Realms', a meditation on time and impermanence, wonder and mystery, magic and melancholy, all familiar themes to those who are attuned to my music, but with their own peculiar twist and distinctive flavour.\n\n\n\nSo, sit back and enjoy the view, on the musical journey that never ends…\" - Bill Nelson, November 2022\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with printable artwork as PDF files.\n\nFor further information, please visit the album's page in the discography section of Bill's website -  www.billnelson.com/marvellous-realms",

      "about": "Non-Stop Mystery Action was first released as a limited edition CD in November 2009.\n\n\n\n\"This is not an album for casual listening, playing in the car, (too many quiet and subtle details will be lost), or for tapping toes to. But it IS an album for those of you who appreciate being taken on strange and somewhat dark journeys. No orthodox arrangements here, just a magnetic, hypnotic continuum of sound and atmosphere, a stream-of-consciousness flow on which to sail your paper boats of dreams.\n\n\n\n\"I'm trying not to underestimate my audience's capacity for enjoying a little weirdness with this one. I've deliberately kept it quite single-minded and 'pure' in that sense. There are no sops to orthodox tastes. In fact, there's little to hang on to if you're not used to being cast adrift in strange oceans without a life-belt. But, I'm going to take the gamble that some of you will be equal to the challenge.\n\nAre you up to it?\n\n\n\n\"The album's style ranges from dark, industrial improvised blues loops to extended, long-form compositions incorporating found-sounds, digital noise, treated voice samples, neo-classical orchestrations, spoken word narratives, sliced n' diced samples of once popular songs, jazzy guitars, towers full of bells, bad-acid psychedelia, autobiographical commentary, subtle irony and melancholic, time-travelling whimsy.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with album artwork.\n\nFor further details and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/non-stop-mystery-action",

The predominant tonality centres on synths and treated piano. The pieces shift through various changes within their individual length but there's plenty of melodic content and beats that drift in and out of the frame. There's even a cute and ironic disco track with a retro feel to it.\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nThe album comes complete with PDF artwork files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, check out the album's page on Dreamsville:-  www.billnelson.com/theatre-falling-leaves",

      "about": "Albion Dream Vortex was originally released as a limited edition CD in September 2013.\n\n\n\n\"Albion Dream Vortex is an instrumental album blending guitars and keyboards in a variety of styles. It contains subtle references to instrumental music I've made throughout my career, embracing ambient, electronic, vintage and modern, wrapped up in a dream-like vortex of sound.\n\n\n\n\"It's not written in an obvious, 'intro, verse, chorus, bridge, verse, repeat chorus, end' form. The music is rather more fluid, sometimes 'non-linear' and develops along different lines to a rock or pop song...It doesn't attempt to arrive at a particular stylistic conclusion but grows organically from point to point without being forced to make obvious 'points'. In that sense, its 'point' is simply to be pure music, music for its own sake, as much concerned with sound and atmosphere as note choices or hooks, etc.\n\n\n\n\"Also, with this album as with several others of mine, no one track is meant to stand alone as the album's signifier, (though the title track comes conceptually close). Instead, each track forms one single building block of an entire edifice. It's a complete album rather than a collection of separate tracks and should be 'read' as a whole construction, from start to finish.\n\n\n\n\"Albion Dream Vortex treats you like an adult, doesn't talk baby language to you, doesn't feel the need to lead you by the hand through its mysterious corridors, but simply opens its doors for you to enter and explore. I hope, as you familiarise yourself with its twists and turns that you'll want to spend more and more time with it.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with album artwork as PDF files.\n\nFor further information and some fantastic fan reviews, check out the album's page in the discography at  www.billnelson.com/albion-dream-vortex",

So, in a sense, 'Modern Moods' is a compilation of 'left-overs'. But the amazing thing was that these left-overs actually fitted together in an interesting way and have created a rather nice album with lots of variety.\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nThis download come complete with PDF artwork files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, visit the album's page at Dreamsville:  www.billnelson.com/modern-moods-mighty-atoms",

      "about": "Model Village is an orchestral instrumental album first released on CD in October 2011.\n\n\n\n\"Imagine an idealised, dreamily romanticised (but charmingly surreal) country village somewhere around the earlier part of the 20th century...maybe it's not far from the coast, surrounded by rolling hills, sun-kissed meadows, orchards and windmills...but inhabited by a smilingly perverse vicar and an eccentric pub landlord, buxom farmers wives, rampant milk-maids, all with an appetite for quietly illicit but gentle sensuality, all this coupled with summer thunder, fruity orchards, golden harvests and gorgeous twilights that backdrop magic stars...Well, that's what I'm aiming at.\n\nIt's a pastoral 'sound painting' which attempts to materialise the romantic, poetic, English village of my dreams...a kind of 'Bill Nelson Brigadoon' I suppose. Every time you play the album, the village appears from the mists, unspoiled, sun drenched, and summer-sweet. It's an album which (I hope) works on several levels at once.\n\nThis one has its own unique place in my 'canon'. It's an imagined soundtrack to an equally imaginary inter-war, rural life, English film documentary...Powell and Pressburger perhaps...'A Canterbury Tale' filtered through the prism of a childhood adventure annual, Enid Blyton on hallucinogenics, Humphrey Jennings with a cup of whimsical breakfast tea.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with artwork.\n\nFor further album information, visit the discography at Dreamsville:  www.billnelson.com/model-village",

      "about": "'Songs Of The Blossom Tree Optimists' was originally released on CD in 2011...\n\n\n\n\"This album can be appreciated as a companion piece to 'Model Village' or as an independent project in its own right. It is a song-based album with the emphasis on vocals and acoustic guitar but with added orchestral colours and percussion to give a neo-baroque flavour to the music.\n\nThe album could also be thought of as the missing link between 'Northern Dream', 'Rosewood' and 'The Alchemical Adventures of Sailor Bill'.\n\n\n\n\"It's a warm, heartfelt fantasia with lots of detail and cross-references. An album for grown-ups who can appreciate music that paints pictures.\n\n\n\n\"A personal homage to a kind of long-lost, romantic, utopian 'Englishness'. Many of the songs on these albums attempt to capture an elusive, ancient spirit, a spirit of a place inhabited by quiet ghosts unique to old Albion, an English Arcadia, an imaginary Eden that only exists in the gentle souls of artists and poets. It's quite artificial, dreamlike, ethereal, a figment of Faerie, a Midsummer Night's Dream...Beautiful, fragile and utterly, seductively unreal.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThe album comes complete with album artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further Information, visit the album's page on the discography at  www.billnelson.com/songs-of-the-blossom-tree-optimists",

      "about": "Chameleon is an instrumental album of 'library music', initially released towards the end of 1986 on the Themes International Music label. \n\n\n\nOn its release Chameleon was extremely difficult to obtain, as albums of library music (for use in production of TV and radio programmes) were always pressed in limited numbers and unavailable outside of their intended market. \n\nAfter years of being unavailable to all but the most avid collectors, Chameleon was released as a limited edition CD in 2002.\n\n\n\n\"Very simply recorded, slightly quirky, short pieces...a little bit whimsical and often quite jolly...not so serious as Simplex or Chance Encounters...\n\n\n\nYou have to keep in mind that this was made as a Library Music album. Library music is created to be used as television or radio background music and will more often than not end up with a narrator speaking over the music...sometimes the music is chosen to lend a mood to a documentary film, so there will possibly be other sounds laid over the music by the TV studio technicians, as well as narration.\n\nFor this reason, one of the rules of library music is that it should contain no prominent melodies or a strong lead instrument. It has to function as aural wallpaper, a background atmosphere rather than a dominant musical motif.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with artwork scans in PDF format.\n\n\n\nFor further info and fan reviews, check out the album's web-page on the discography at:  www.billnelson.com/chameleon",

      "about": "\"I chose the title of this album simply because it is, when all's said and done, an eclectic mix of tracks without adherence to any one particular genre. In that sense it certainly is a ‘mixed up’ album!\n\n\n\nOn another level, the title harks back to my 1950’s childhood when the term ‘mixed up kid’ was often applied to any child who didn’t quite fit the behaviour patterns expected of children back then. I’ve never thought of myself as a ‘mixed up kid’, (though others may have done), but my tastes in music are wide and eclectic and I suppose, in that respect, they could be categorised as somewhat mixed up.\n\n\n\nI’ve always enjoyed fusing different genres together and I try not to lock music into tightly defined categories. Most of my work has taken that approach and this album is no different. These days, in music at least, there’s no need to show your passport at the frontier. So, sit back and listen and enjoy the kaleidoscopic ‘Mixed Up Kid’!\" - Bill Nelson 2021\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with PDF artwork.\n\nFor further information go to the album's page at  www.billnelson.com/mixed-up-kid",

(One clue is in the album's title:- a combination of the words 'fantasy,' 'phantasm' and 'electronic.')\n\nIt's a melodic, 99.9% vocal based guitar and keyboard driven album with plenty of colourful textural details and semi-surreal twists and turns.\n\nPop via strange antennae...Crystal Set music for sensual supermen, erotic noise for sexy sailors and sailorettes, big blue dreams for 'dig it now' kids, rough and tumble for the refined of mind. Be there with it, or forever be square!\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nAs always, the download comes complete with album artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, check out  www.billnelson.com/fantasmatron",

      "about": "First released on CD in November 2010, Fables and Dreamsongs (A Golden Book of Experimental Ballads) features a mix of vocal and instrumental tracks.\n\n\n\n\"Fables and Dreamsongs was inspired, in part, from the 'Golden Wonder Books' that my mother owned as a child, and from which she read to me when I was a little boy. These thick, beautifully illustrated compendiums contained classic fables and stories by Britains best authors and artists. Looking at them now, what strikes me is how high the standard of writing was. The vocabulary used, (though they were children's stories), was so much more sophisticated than our modern day approach to children's literature. I suspect that many of these tales would prove difficult for contemporary adults to grasp, let alone children. There certainly was no 'talking down' involved. Back when these books were published, in the 1920s and '30s, the elegance, descriptive and emotive properties of the English language magically connected with children, even at an early age. (Well, they certainly did with me, thanks to my mother reading to me from these books when I was still an infant.)\n\nSo, whilst Fables and Dreamsongs is a 'book' of experimental ballads, it is also firmly rooted in the feelings I had when I sat by my mother's side as an infant, as she read to me from these wonderful collections of classic children's literature.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with artwork as PDF files.\n\nFor further details and fan reviews head to the album's dedicated page at Dreamsville...  www.billnelson.com/fables-dreamsongs",

The latter serve as interludes for the longer, more introspective pieces but I think the real key to the album will be those much longer, slowly evolving, exploratory tracks...\n\nThe mood is that of a series of sound paintings, gathered from a romantic, imaginary future that never arrived.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with CD artwork.\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews head to the album's page on the discography on Dreamsville:-  www.billnelson.com/signals-realms-light",

It's certainly worthy of extended listening and some of its tracks may well contribute to a 'classic songs' list at some point in the future.\n\nStylistically, it covers a variety of genres. I won't itemise all the angles here...you'll just have to buy it and find out for yourself!\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, take a look at the album's page in the discography section of Dreamsville:  www.billnelson.com/dream-transmission-pavilion",

      "about": "Mazda Kaleidoscope is an instrumental album originally released on CD in 2008. The album was recorded as the third part of a trilogy of complementary releases, the associated albums being Silvertone Fountains and Illuminated At Dusk. \n\n\n\n\"Mazda Kaleidoscope enters a deeper, darker space and features MUCH longer tracks. It utilises a more abstract, painterly approach, concerning itself with texture and colour as much as thematic or melodic development. It's the least 'rock' flavoured album of the trilogy [Silvertone Fountains, Illuminated at Dusk, and Mazda Kaleidoscope], certainly the least 'gung-ho' of the three. It's all atmosphere and mystery, a fog filled with gleaming stars. Which is why I'm so fond of it!\n\nThe trilogy is meant to be heard as a whole, in sequence...each album is just one third of the total idea. Until you've heard all three in the correct sequence, you'll only get part of the epic picture it paints. However, this is only the way I intended it. YOU don't HAVE to hear it as I've suggested above at all. Nevertheless, I thought it might be of interest for you to have this insight into the way I hoped the music might work across the three albums. For me, it's one epic movie in sound.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with full cover artwork. \n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, please visit Bill's website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/mazda-kaleidoscope",

My original concept involved listening to the albums in a fixed order...Which is as follows: 'Silvertone', then 'Illuminated', followed by 'Mazda'.\"\n\n'Silvertone' sets out the stall, as it were, introducing a calm and contemplative note in the listener but also hinting at things to come on the companion albums. It is a quite intense album in some ways, exploring various corners of my work in an introspective fashion, though there are light-hearted moments too. The tracks should not be judged by only hearing the first minute or so of each track in 'channel-hopping' fashion though. The pieces sometimes go through quite dramatic changes within each composition, often ending up in a different musical space from the one in which they started. \n\nIt's important to hear each piece in its entirety. This album requires complete, concentrated listening...rather than a skimming through the intros of each track to seek something instantly appealing. It will reward the listener who appreciates subtleties, detail and cross-references to other styles of music. It's also quite an emotional album for me, containing much tenderness, as well as careful thought.\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nAs always, the album comes complete with PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further info visit the album's page on Dreamsville at:  www.billnelson.com/silvertone-fountains",

      "about": "\"Last year (2019) I installed a Cubase Pro advanced recording system in my home studio, after my much loved Mackie hardware based system finally gave up the ghost after 20 years of constant use. I had been reluctant to go down the purely software based route but now there was no other choice. The learning curve was fairly steep and it has been a slow process but I’m gradually getting used to it.\n\n\n\n\"Since installing the new system I’ve recorded over 100 tracks, putting ideas down spontaneously, just to get to grips with how the equipment works. It’s been a sometimes frustrating process but now is the time to begin releasing some of this material. \n\n\n\n\"I’ve chosen 14 tracks from the 100 or so recordings I’ve made and assembled them into an album. This is the first album to be released using the Cubase system, but more will follow. The album is titled ‘New Vibrato Wonderland’ and is vocal and guitar based with a hint of modern psychedelia coupled with electro-glitch percussion sounds and a touch of string orchestra. But don’t take that description as accurate, you might hear something quite different. Whatever it is, it is certainly recognisable as a ‘Bill Nelson album.’ How could it be otherwise? Hope you like it!\" - Bill Nelson - November 2020.\n\n\n\nAs always, the download comes with album artwork as printable PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further details about this album, check out the album's page on the official Bill Nelson website 'Dreamsville' -  www.billnelson.com/new-vibrato-wonderland",

The album was recorded as the second part of a trilogy of complementary releases, the associated albums being Silvertone Fountains and Mazda Kaleidoscope.\n\n\n\n\"Illuminated embraces music which, (I personally felt), was a little less introspective, (on the whole). It's a bit more geared towards the rock guitar end of my spectrum...(or plectrum!). The arrangements are sometimes rather 'epic' sounding, larger and more 'up-front' than Silvertone, and there is more use of overdriven guitar sounds and percussion, though still with some odd twists and turns.\n\nThe music here might, at one time, have found itself on a Nelsonica Convention album but its purpose in the trilogy is to shift gears a little, to slip into more familiar waters before diving deep into Mazda's strange lagoon. In a way, Illuminated provides a kind of respite from the introspection of the other albums. A more familiar ride for some, perhaps.\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nAs always, this download comes complete with full cover artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, please visit Bill's website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/illuminated-dusk",

      "about": "\"Dazzlebox is the second release of recordings made using my relatively new Cubase recording software. It is an instrumental double album with a variety of stylistic twists and turns. The tracks sometimes use 'distressed' drum and percussion sounds, electronic effects and keyboards but always layered with a rainbow of electric guitars.\n\n \n\n\"The thirty tracks presented here provide a rich, sometimes complex listening experience. It will require a patient and attentive ear to fully appreciate, but I hope you will take the time to unlock the music's charms and find much to enjoy.\" - Bill Nelson, March 2021\n\n\n\nThis release comes complete with PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further details, visit  www.billnelson.com/dazzlebox",

      "about": "‘Acquitted By Mirrors’ was a Bill Nelson Fan Club magazine published between 1982 and 1990. By its 13th issue in 1986, seven EPs – all of which were recorded on either 4-track or 8-track analogue recording equipment at The Echo Observatory (Bill’s home studio) – were issued exclusively to fan club members in conjunction with alternating issues of the magazine. While some of the tracks can now be found on various CD releases, many others are making their long-awaited CD debut with this release.\n\nAs well as having all the fan club EPs together on CD for the first time, ‘Transcorder’ also includes hard-to-find B-sides and rare tracks. The album ultimately closes with five previously unreleased instrumentals that were recorded at The Echo Observatory during the mid-1980s.\n\n\n\nThis download comes complete with album artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nFor further information, take a look at the album's page on the discography section of the Bill Nelson website.  www.billnelson.com/transcorder",

      "about": "'Return To Tomorrow (These Tapes Rewind Volume 1)' was first released as a limited edition CD in 2012 and was initially made available to attendees of Nelsonica 12, who's copy of the CD was included in their admission price.\n\n\n\nAlthough the album was released in 2012, the tracks themselves date back to a period between 1984 and 1995. Coming from a huge archive of material deemed to have been lost due to the breakdown of studio equipment. A fan-funded replacement was found and the task of digitising this lost archive began.\n\n\n\n'Return To Tomorrow' captures the first albums-worth of songs that were selected for public consumption...\n\n\n\nThe download comes complete with album artwork as PDF files.\n\n\n\nTake a look at the album's page in the discography section of Dreamsville for further information and fan reviews. \n\nwww.billnelson.com/return-to-tomorrow",

      "about": "First released on CD in 2007. this guitar-based instrumental album proved a big hit with Bill's fans...\n\n\n\n\"The ‘Gleaming Without Lights’ album was created as a vehicle for a thirty seven minutes and fifty seconds long instrumental composition called ‘Dreamland Illuminated’, originally recorded as the soundtrack for an autobiographical video I made in 2006. \n\nDespite being originally intended as a video soundtrack, ‘Dreamland Illuminated’ also functions independently of its visual context, as a long-form instrumental work.\n\nThe other six tracks on the ‘Gleaming Without Lights’ album have been chosen to complement the piece and to provide a sympathetic framework within which it can sit.\n\nTo some extent, the entire album fits within the autobiographical concept. The track ‘North-East’, for instance, is intended to conjure up visions of the rugged North Yorkshire coastline, an area of natural beauty that has fascinated me throughout my life.\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nAs always, the download includes the album artwork as PDF Files.\n\n\n\nFor further info - visit  www.billnelson.com/gleaming-without-lights",

One that defines me, here and now, in a very direct and special way.\n\nIt's an album that ignores whatever the current mainstream is pursuing. It approaches the listener from a very different musical universe. I was aiming for beauty and transcendence and quiet power too, something futuristic but also ancient, ultra-modern but timeless.\n\nIn keeping with recent themes, I think of the album as a sort of clock mechanism, a hand-made, bejewelled movement that, (hopefully), once set in motion, fascinates and intrigues the listener with its interlocking parts and shining, myriad cogs and wheels...A golden, whirring, dream factory of song.\" - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nAs always, the download comes with complete PDF artwork. \n\n\n\nFor further info, including some great fan reviews, check out the album's page on  www.billnelson.com/golden-melodies-of-tomorrow",

      "about": "First released on CD in July 2016 as a very limited edition of 500 copies, it sold out in just one week and has since been unavailable...until now!\n\n\n\n'All That I Remember' is a very personal and autobiographical album.\n\nIt's entirely instrumental...a musical painting (or sonic movie) of an early period of my life.\n\nIt's a complex album, a bit of a puzzle, yet quite easy and explicit in other ways.  As always, I'm playing ironic games with the listener's expectations, throwing diverse genres together, making odd juxtapositions.  Is it music that requires intelligent thought to appreciate fully?  I have no idea but, it's not an album for those who might be looking for an instant rock music fix.  And yet, I have to admit it has some elements of that in it too. - Bill Nelson\n\n\n\nAs always, the album comes complete with PDF artwork, this release also includes a set of 'listening notes' with an explanation behind the theme of each track.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews, take a look at the album's entry on the Dreamsville discography:-  www.billnelson.com/all-that-i-remember",

      "about": "Shining Reflector is an album mixing vocal and instrumental pieces. Originally released on CD in December 2014, in a limited edition run of 500, it sold out in only 10 days.\n\n\n\nThe material included on Shining Reflector was created during the Stereo Star Maps sessions when that album was planned as a double. In the end, the material was split into three different releases, Swoons and Levitations being the third album.\n\n\n\nShining Reflector has a different feel to Stereo Star Maps. It's a bit more up-tempo and slightly 'pop-rocky' but it has a wide-screen sonic quality too.\n\n\n\nAs always, the download comes with complete PDF artwork. \n\n\n\nFor further info, including some great fan reviews, check out the album's page on  www.billnelson.com/shining-reflector",

Using the original live CD backing tracks, the lead guitars were overdubbed in my home studio, keeping things as spontaneous and loose as possible to simulate a live experience. The overdubs were restricted to one take improvisations in the main and have been retained in their raw state.\" - Bill Nelson.\n\n\n\nThis release comes complete with downloadable artwork in PDF format.\n\n\n\nFor further album details visit the discography on Bill's website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/plectrajet",

      "about": "'The Last Lamplighter' is a brand new album and is intended as a companion piece to 'Stand By: Light Coming...' \n\nMany of its tracks were originally intended for the latter album but running times dictated otherwise. I decided to combine them with tracks I'd laid aside for an album titled 'Vulcan Street', an album and title I'd abandoned. A few more tracks were also recorded to make up the track count and the 'The Last Lamplighter' was the end result.\n\n \n\n'The Last Lamplighter', at first, had a subtitle: ('Return To Vulcan Street'), but this was dropped from the final artwork. \n\n\n\nThe album contains 15 tracks of mostly vocal-based songs but with a couple of instrumental interludes. It has an eclectic mix of styles. \n\n\n\nThe title track is dedicated to my Great Grandfather on my Mother's side of the family, (John Henry Griffiths,) who actually worked as a lamplighter in the city of Wakefield in the 1930s and '40s. He passed away in the early 1950s when I was very young but I can remember visiting him in his bedroom at Marriot's Buildings where I was born. He spent his last couple of years in bed and seemed to be a gentle old man although my Mother tells me that he was sometimes difficult and often drunk when she was a child. She acknowledges that he mellowed in his old age and that he liked and looked forward to seeing me. My Mother also recalls, as a young girl, sometimes accompanying him on his rounds as a lamplighter on the then cobbled streets of Wakefield. A romantic image that inspired the album's title track.\n\n\n\nWhat was to be the central track of 'Vulcan Street' is also included on the album. 'Vulcan Street' conjures images of terrace houses, infernal factories and sparks and fire in my mind, the industrialised grey and foggy North of the 1940s and '50s. Had there been a Vulcan Street in Wakefield back then, I'm sure it would have had its lamps lit by my Great Grandfather. \n\n\n\nThis new album is a download only release and is exclusively available from my Bandcamp page. \n\nIt comes complete with downloadable artwork which you can print out to use when burning the album to a CDR. \n\n\n\nI hope you will enjoy it!\n\n\n\nBill Nelson. August 2019.\n\n\n\nFor further info, check out the album's page on  www.billnelson.com/last-lamplighter",

      "about": "First released on CD July 2009, 'Fancy Planets' has a rock/pop orientation, albeit with a twist. I'm not sure how to exactly describe the music to you as, even within one song, there are lots of ideas at play.\n\n\n\nThe music is very rich sounding, sometimes a 'wall of sound' with lots of guitars and crunchy, chunky drums and beats. It's big, tough and flamboyant, but beautiful too. A couple of tracks, (at least), conjure up the term 'retro-contempo psychedelic glam rock with poptone tints'. Yes, a weird and funny description but it fits some of the material like a glove!\n\n\n\nThe download comes with complete PDF artwork. \n\n\n\nFor further info, including some great fan reviews, check out the album's page on 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/fancy-planets",

      "about": "The Years is an instrumental album that was first released on CD in June 2015. The limited run of copies sold out in just one month.\n\n\n\nThe music on the album, in the main, is kind of kitsch and easy-listening, quite jolly in parts but with deeper reflective moments. As always, it's not turned out quite the way I expected. It's not as pure or perfect as I'd hoped, but it's been made very spontaneously with a feeling of urgency. It's not an album that I've pondered too deeply or furrowed my brow about. It's emerged almost of its own accord.\n\n\n\nThe download comes with complete PDF artwork. \n\n\n\nFor further info, including some great fan reviews, check out the album's page on  www.billnelson.com/the-years",

      "about": "'Quiet Bells' was originally released in March 2015,\n\n the limited run of 500 CDs sold out in just 7 days! \n\n\n\n“This album is a semi-ambient guitar instrumental fantasia.\n\nIt is predominantly guitar based but with lots of AxeFX processing and features the prototype of my ‘Astroluxe’ signature guitar. The album contains 18 tracks and enough musical mysterioso to keep you digging deep for many months.\n\nIt has a lovely, gentle, ruminative atmosphere which will, I hope, provoke deep thoughts and technicolour dreams.”\n\n\n\nThis release comes complete with downloadable PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further album details visit the discography on Bill's website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/quiet-bells",

      "about": "Originally released on CD in July 2012, 'Joy Through Amplification' was perhaps the most 'rock' oriented Bill Nelson album for some years. It features raw, edgy guitar work and strong percussion. The album's 13 vocal tracks are separated by 13 short, abstract guitar instrumental interludes which provide an experimental element, almost like an album within an album.\n\n\n\n“The album is, in some ways, a response to those who have wanted a rock album from me. I could have done a '70s style, Be Bop Deluxe sort of thing, but there’s little fun for me in that as I covered those bases all those years ago...so I thought I’d do something even more rock than Be Bop, but push it out of shape a little whilst incorporating some of the stylised machismo elements that real rock bands take so seriously, (much to my amusement!).\n\nSo there’s some chugging, deliberately dumb and dirty riffs, squalling wah-wah guitars, semi-moronic drumming and even a touch of shredding.”\n\n\n\nThis release comes complete with downloadable PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further album details visit the discography on Bill's website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/joy-through-amplification",

      "about": "'Songs For Ghosts' was originally released as a limited edition DOUBLE CD in October 2017.\n\n\n\n\"Songs For Ghosts is a double album of predominately vocal oriented songs with a couple of mellow instrumental excursions.\n\nThe initial concept was centred around a vague feeling of melancholia, a sadness at the heart of things, but, as is usual with my work, that first idea was modified during the actual recording process.\n\nI wanted to maintain a sense of ‘diffusion’, songs that were not quite linear, songs that refused to ‘solidify’ to a certain extent, with free-form elements brought to bear and lyrics that were slightly more stream of consciousness than anything literal or relating to specific situations. Enigmatic and automatic, like trance induced creations, unconscious communications from somewhere suggestively ‘elsewhere.'\n\nBut, inevitably, as the recording of the album progressed, this concept merged with rather more straightforward, prosaic elements, and, indeed a couple of the songs have turned out to be quite direct and specific. (I suppose my pop sensibility will never really desert me.)\n\nNevertheless, something of the originally intended ‘vagueness’ or ‘ghostliness,’ remains...these are songs directed at realms beyond, perhaps couched in a kind of mutant pop language, but still recognisably, ‘other.’\"\n\n\n\nThe album comes complete with downloadable artwork in PDF format.\n\n\n\nFor further album details visit the discography on Bill's website 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/songs-for-ghosts",

      "about": "'That Old Mysterioso' is destined, I think, to become one of my favourite albums. It has its own atmosphere but sits nicely alongside such albums as 'Golden Melodies Of Tomorrow,' Fantasmatron,' 'Stereo Star Maps' and 'The Dreamshire Chronicles.' The album is mainly vocal-based but with a sprinkling of instrumentals. The tracks feature a cosmic combination of guitars, keyboards and electronics. The front cover has a surreal photograph of myself taken by Martin Bostock and the rest of the package contains a range of bizarre self-portraiture. As always with my work, it will reward repeated listenings and, I'm sure, become one of your favourites as well as mine. \n\n\n\nThis was originally a limited edition CD pressing of 500 copies which are now sold out. It's made available here for you to download along with the PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further info check out the album's page on 'Dreamsville':-  www.billnelson.com/that-old-mysterioso",

      "about": "’Tripping The Light Fantastic’ is only the second live album I’ve ever officially released. The first was Be Bop Deluxe’s ‘Live In The Air Age’ album, way back in the distant 1970s. A great deal of ‘time saturated’ water has flowed under all our rickety bridges since then, but this new live album captures a brief moment in that same flow of time. \n\n\n\nSensibilities change, both on the part of the audience, and also every artist worthy of the term ‘artist’ over the years, but I’m very happy to say that my audience has grown with my own development and peculiar sensibilities throughout the years. This isn’t music from then, but music from ’now,’ (though the now is always in flux and shifting, as am I.)\n\n\n\nSo, it is to those loyal, enthusiastic, brilliant listeners that I dedicate this album.\n\nBill Nelson 2017.\n\n\n\nThis digital download version includes different artwork than the limited edition 500 CD pressing, catalogue number Sonoluxe CD044.\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/tripping-the-light-fantastic",

It is a direct linear development from the Dreamland To Starboard album and sets Bill's acoustic guitar in an ambient soundscape that suggests a jazz and contemporary classical context as well as a broader neo-roots music vibe.\n\n\n\nThe download includes all of the original CD artwork in PDF format.\n\n\n\nFor further information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/rosewood-vol-one",

The title is in the grand tradition of imaginary bands such as ‘Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars’, ‘Jet Silver And The Dolls Of Venus’, ‘Willy And The Poor Boys’, ‘The Blue Men’ etc. The album will appeal to fans of my earlier Be Bop Deluxe era whilst bringing a more contemporary twist to the songs. It’s a light-hearted, positive, good vibes album. I hope you will enjoy it. \n\nThe download includes all CD printable artwork in PDF format.\n\nBill Nelson. April 2017\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/kid-flip-golden-spacemen",

This 12-track album is only available as a digital download and comes complete with full, detailed artwork which can be printed out.\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/six-string-super-apparatus",

      "about": "'New Northern Dream' is a sequel to 'Northern Dream,' the album I recorded in 1970 and released independently in 1971. It brings a new perspective to the album's concept with totally new songs but also some direct references to material on the original album. It's a fusion of my early '70s style with my more current sounds. The album has an 8-page booklet with some photographs by Martin Bostock reproducing some of the original album's settings.\n\n\n\nIMPORTANT\n\nThis download includes all of the artwork for you to print and a copy of Bill's personal listening notes which give a background to each track.\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/new-northern-dream",

      "about": "'Special Metal' is an outsider album for me, one which I didn't feel like committing to a physical CD, (which normally I would do for new albums,) but instead decided to allocate it to a digital download only release. It's an album which, as the title suggests, strays into heavy rock territory but with some ballad intervals. It might be said that it falls out of character for me, especially when I tend to eschew rock music for something less brutal these days. But it's an interesting proposition, with a certain dynamism that can only be regarded as straight ahead 'rock', albeit with some twists and turns that, inevitably, locate it firmly in a more contemporary mode. I think some of you might enjoy it!\n\n\n\nThe album comes complete with printable PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/special-metal",

      "about": "This is one of the rarest of Bill Nelson's ambient instrumental albums. These eight tracks were originally created for a live performance in Wakefield Cathedral as part of the city's 1990 Arts Festival. The performance was titled 'Opus Illuminatus' and featured live improvisations on guitar (by Bill) and saxophone (by his younger brother Ian), played over interactive 'backing tracks'. These tracks (without the live overdubbed guitar and saxophone), were released as an extremely limited 500 edition cassette only item in 1990... \n\nThey became highly collectable and were never made available as an official CD album until now.\n\n\n\nThis unique and very special download only re-issue features superb digital remastering by Bill's long time, Fairview Studio's, associate John Spence. It presents, for the first time ever, an opportunity to hear this music at an audio quality previously denied the original limited edition cassette release. It also features fabulous new artwork by David Graham. \n\n\n\nEven without the live performance guitar and sax improvisations, these mysterious and mystical pieces stand up as valuable in their own right and will be enthusiastically welcomed by fans.\n\n\n\nThe download includes the PDF artwork.\n\n\n\nSonoluxe CD032\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/altar-pieces",

      "about": "Long time David Bowie collaborator and now lead guitarist of The Cure, Reeves Gabrels, has been a friend of Bill Nelson for over 20 years. During that time a collaboration has often been discussed but it was only recently that serious plans were made for the two guitarists to record together. The result is 'Fantastic Guitars,' an album of guitar instrumentals that marries their playing in a unique and exciting way. If you love electric guitars they don't get more astonishingly electric than this! \n\n\n\nwww.reevz.net\n\n  www.billnelson.com\n\n\n\n This download includes all artwork in PDF format.\n\n\n\nOriginally released as a limited edition CD pressing.\n\nCatalogue No. Sonoluxe CD034.",

      "about": "'Luxury Lodge' is a special album, originally released in extremely limited quantities to coincide with Nelsonica 2003. It contains both vocal and instrumental tracks, including two of my favourites, 'Flux Of Desire' and 'Golden Balloon.' It also has 'Wonder Of The Moment' and 'Moonrocket Highway' which have become popular numbers in my live performance, the latter track dating back to 1990's Wakefield Arts Festival. Now, for the first time, the album has been re-issued as a digital download to allow a wider audience access to the music.\n\n\n\nDownload includes all artwork in PDF format.\n\n\n\nFor further information visit  www.billnelson.com/luxury-lodge",

      "about": "\"Plaything\" is an album of guitar-based instrumentals, in a similar style to my 'The Romance Of Sustain' album. The album's packaging was created by respected American artist Frank Olinsky who has designed covers for many major musical artists. (Frank's original artwork is downloadable along with the album.) The 'Plaything' CD has been out of print for several years now and has become a sought after item amongst collectors. This digital re-issue will enable more people to hear the music on 'Plaything' without being forced to pay the premium prices asked for second-hand copies of the original CD. The album contains some of my personal favourite instrumental recordings, particularly 'Rainclouds Over Paris Of My Dreams,' 'A Prayer To Sleep With Mercurial Women,' 'The Revenge Of The Man In The Burning Ice Cream Van,' 'The Embarkation Song Of The Last Fast Airship,' 'Come To Me In My Dreams' and 'Six-Legged Critter Singing In The Trees.' I'm pleased to make this music available again and hope you will enjoy exploring its twists and turns.\" Bill Nelson September 2014.\n\n\n\nOriginally released as a limited edition CD in 2003. \n\nCatalogue No. Universal Twang Records UTCD 002\n\n\n\nDownload includes all artwork in JPEG format.\n\n\n\nFor further album information and fan reviews visit  www.billnelson.com/plaything",
