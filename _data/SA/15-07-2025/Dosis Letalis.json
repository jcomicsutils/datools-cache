      "about": "This split is dedicated to Alan Turing, a mathematics prodigy who changed the course of World War 2. \n\n\n\nWith a brilliant mind and a team of cryptographers working at Bletchely Park, Turing was not only successful in breaking secret coded messages sent by German encryption devices (known as enigma machines) but also shortened the war by 2 years and saved millions of lives in the process. \n\n\n\nAided by Gordon Welchman, Turing made developments to 'The Bomba' a highly complex electromechanical machine, their new version became known as 'The Bombe'). \n\n\n\nThe original was designed by Polish cryptologist Marian Rejewski in 1938, who was forced to share the technology with the British in July 1939 as the situation in Poland further deteriorated. \n\n\n\nThis revolutionary device not only became the blueprint for the modern computer but provided the means that British Intelligence services needed to decipher previously unbreakable messages sent by the enigma machines to German forces. \n\n\n\n7 years after the war, Turing was charged with gross indecency for having sexual relations with another man, a criminal offence in Britain at the time. \n\n\n\nAs a result, he lost his job with the secret service and was sentenced to undergo chemical castration by means of a series of oestrogen injections. After spiralling into a heavy depression, Turing committed suicide by consuming an apple he had laced with cyanide in 1954 he was aged just 41. \n\n\n\nIn 2013, Turing finally received a pardon by Queen Elizabeth II thanks to newly introduced legislation that also extended pardons to thousands of other men convicted before homosexuality became decriminalised in 1967. \n\n\n\nWinston Churchill described Alan Turing's work as: “the single biggest contribution to the allied victory during World War II\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\"A man provided with paper, pencil, and rubber, and subject to strict discipline, is in effect a universal machine.\" \n\n\n\nRIP Alan Turing June 23, 1912 - June 7, 1954 \n\n\n\n\n\nreleased June 23, 2017, digitally on The Dark Thursday \n\n\n\nthedarkthursday.bandcamp.com/album/static-encryptions-dosis-letalis-screenslaver-split",

      "about": "''Long-awaited release of this crushing double cassette set from Dosis Letalis, the project's second AOW release based on Netflix's labyrinthine political thriller House Of Cards. The four walls here are easily some of the heaviest work i've heard from Nemanja, reflecting the brutally dark and cutthroat atmosphere of its inspiration. Fans of DL's politically-charged offerings will not be disappointed by this set, as the material here simply destroys. Massive, brooding walls of thick unctuous distortion, brimming over with the project's now-trademark crackling tones. Treble and bass united in unholy, destructive power, an elegy for a fictional representation of tyranny that seems more and more realistic with each passing day in the United States. The layout is quite lovely, as well.\n\nPackaged as a double cassette set, with each cassette having unique artwork. Released in a limited edition of 10 hand-numbered copies.''\n\nCory Strand\n\n\n\n\n\nReleased February 17, 2017,\n\nas double c40 tape set, through mighty Altar Of Waste \n\n\n\naltarofwasterecords.blogspot.rs/2017/02/dosis-letalis-lessons-in-ruthlessness.html",
