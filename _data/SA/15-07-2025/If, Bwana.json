      "about": "The basis of this recording uses Leslie Ross’ piece “Air” from her drop by drop, suddenly cd on XI Records (and also on Bandcamp). I was practicing my reed instrument playing to this multiphonic bassoon drone, and then decided I would record (in a sort of Exquisite Corpse way) each of my wind parts (clarinet, alto clarinet, alt and tenor saxes) to Leslie’s piece, but without listening to my previous playing. The original quartet (without the bassoon recording), didn’t quite work, so I did some pitch shifting and stretching to copies of my original version, making it a 12 track version. Which still was not quite right. Long story short, this version is a wind quintet version, with Leslie’s bassoon recording added. The tenor sax track is the only original recording of mine – the rest are pitched. Stretch versions of the other tracks I played. Hopefully (a) this makes sense, (b) was worth reading, and (c) is worth listening to. Many thanks to Leslie Ross for the composition(s) and permission to use her recording in this.",

The first piece is a studio improv of my playing trumpet, using extended (or perhaps in my case, remedial) techniques, through a microphone, into 2 small amps and captured on a Yamaha digital recorder. Piece 2 is a multitracked version using Ableton Live to slightly stretch and pitch the tracks; they are then sent on their merry way by random chance. the third work takes the tracks from piece 2, where they are arbitrarily edited to get the piece down to about 10 minutes and 30 second or so - which is the length of the original solo version (which is included in each piece). Enjoy....",

      "about": "On this recording of 3 improvised pieces, Marta Sainz vocalizes as well as performs on an amplified dan bau – a Vietnamese single string instrument. Al Margolis (If, Bwana) makes use of what he calls a “detritus box” – one side wood, one side laminate, each half amplified with contact microphones – and all manner of detritus used to make sounds, as well as alto recorder and clarinet.\n\n\n\nThrough the use of her voice and body, Sainz’s performance refers to elements of German Expressionism and the theater of cruelty of Artaud: she is seeking to emotionally shock the viewer with their own experience, without the content and performance having a specific meaning intended in itself. Margolis shows increasing clarity of vision in his work – both as a composer, and on this recording, as an improvisor.\n\n\n\nTogether, they manage to fuse beauty and terror into something truly remarkable. This recording is a very special experience for anyone willing to travel the length of a terrifying way with these accomplished and visionary performers.",

I liked their set very much - which may in fact have been their very first live performance - and when i returned home, i asked them if they would be interested in playing a piece of mine. One of the Ponzi Pieces (so named as it kind of spins itself out from previous recordings, in a potentially endless series of pieces). Which they did - and so there is them playing to the original backing track, plus a version without the backing track (that others can now use for the next version of a Ponzi Piece). And AAAh....pie - uses edited/transformed versions of their original recordings with some of my own guitar sounds added. Enjoy and many thanks to AAAh.",
