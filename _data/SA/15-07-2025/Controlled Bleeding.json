Founder Paul Lemos says in the liner notes to Blistered Bags of Fodder Swaying that having an alias \"allowed me to release everything I had put to tape.\"\n\n\n\nIn characteristic Paul Lemos self-deprecation, he also suggests that one-third of this LP should have been scrapped, but boy are we glad that he didn't do that, because here it is, in all its glory!\n\n\n\nFor the first time released digitally, the one and only album from The Art Barbeque!",

The album has never been released on CD or vinyl, and contains the Paul Lemos-vocal track, Healing Time, a sure highlight.\n\n\n\nGilded Chambers represents light shining through darkness and a new level of bombast is reached with Silken Barb and Germany; a powerful sense of optimism permeates these lovely pieces. According to Lemos, \"this was perhaps our best set of songs.\"\n\n\n\nEssential.",

Paul Lemos describes it best in his own words:\n\n\n\n\"Core was the real highlight of this early period and includes our first 8-track recordings. Joe and I had great fun recording this music. Gone was the angst that had spawned Knees and Bones and Body Samples. Finally, we were able to better imitate the bands we loved. The influence of Mahavishnu, King Crimson, and Swans comes through loud and clear. Core was the climax of this period and the realization of my ambition to work with Subterranean Records, the label that had issued records by Flipper and Dead Kennedys.\"",

      "about": "Originally released in 1987, Songs From the Drain marked a turning point in the relentless output and recording sessions that marked Controlled Bleeding's late-80s era. The recording contains what Paul Lemos refers to as \"odds and sods,\" and the album looks back to the noisy beginnings of the project, as well as forward to even more experimental terrain. You get a mixture here of dark ambient, of heavenly voices, and even synthesizer sounds, not exactly common in the band's oeuvre. All of this wrapped up with gloomy industrial that holds the album together. Songs From the Drain is the perfect end point to close out Controlled Bleeding's incredible 10CD romp through the band's most active period.",

      "about": "Released as a vinyl-only album on Sterile Records in 1986, Controlled Bleeding's Headcrack is a monumental album that saw Paul Lemos and crew delve into experimental soundscape art-music even deeper than on previous releases. A new fascination with vocal chant, acoustic guitar, and piano-led oddities emerges, with a warmth and beauty that serves as a counterpoint to earlier power noise experiments. The record has been praised for its masterful working in the ambient and heavenly voices genres, but on pieces like Dry Lungs, it is evident that something different is going on: industrial scraping and twisting are all over the place, but, perhaps owing to the sublime atmosphere of the record, one hesitates to call the sounds tortured. The result is a glorious weaving of different styles.\n\n\n\nHeadcrack is, in its way, the most hopeful of Controlled Bleeding records, and Artoffact is proud to reissue this masterpiece with remastered audio, updated cover art, and, for the first time, on gorgeous blue vinyl.",

In many ways, this album is the definitive industrial record of the period, featuring screeching metal, distorted power electronics, Paul Lemos' guttural, animal-like screaming, and a healthy dose of feedback.\n\n\n\nThe original Swedish release was a single vinyl with two long tracks of approximately 23 minutes each, one on each side. The Artoffact Records reissue expands Knees and Bones to a double-LP, including a full LP's worth of bonus material, notably the amazing Swallowing Scrap Metal Pt. 5½, which appeared as the final track of the Knees and Bones CD, another hopelessly out of print Controlled Bleeding artifact.",

      "about": "Artoffact Records is proud to announce the reissue of a significant portion of the Controlled Bleeding catalogue.\n\n\n\nReleased on Gary Mundy's Broken Flag label in 1984, the first Controlled Bleeding album was Distress Signals, an almost impossible to find cassette-only album of brutal powernoise and experimentally distorted and tortured vocals. The near hour-long performance is immediate and harsh, and the tape has a kind of holy-grail quality amongst collectors, not least because of the special status of Broken Flag, but also because it has never been properly reissued on either CD or vinyl.\n\n\n\nPart of the mystique of Distress Signals comes from Controlled Bleeding's founder Paul Lemos, who, while putting together this reissue series in conjunction with Artoffact Records, insisted that there are actually two Distress Signals recordings, both very different from each other, and one which has never been heard or released in any form. In fact, according to Lemos, the second Distress Signals is the one which was originally intended for Broken Flag, but due to an error or oversight, a mistake in dubbing or who knows what, the audio on the Broken Flag tape is not the performance intended.\n\n\n\nFrom this came the idea to release two editions of Distress Signals:\n\n\n\nDistress Signals I - a completely remastered and restored edition of the original, rare Broken Flag tape.\n\n\n\nDistress Signals II - Lemos' intended recording, never before released and quite different from the Broken Flag tape.",

      "about": "Artoffact Records is proud to announce the reissue of a significant portion of the Controlled Bleeding catalogue.\n\n\n\nReleased on Gary Mundy's Broken Flag label in 1984, the first Controlled Bleeding album was Distress Signals, an almost impossible to find cassette-only album of brutal powernoise and experimentally distorted and tortured vocals. The near hour-long performance is immediate and harsh, and the tape has a kind of holy-grail quality amongst collectors, not least because of the special status of Broken Flag, but also because it has never been properly reissued on either CD or vinyl.\n\n\n\nPart of the mystique of Distress Signals comes from Controlled Bleeding's founder Paul Lemos, who, while putting together this reissue series in conjunction with Artoffact Records, insisted that there are actually two Distress Signals recordings, both very different from each other, and one which has never been heard or released in any form. In fact, according to Lemos, the second Distress Signals is the one which was originally intended for Broken Flag, but due to an error or oversight, a mistake in dubbing or who knows what, the audio on the Broken Flag tape is not the performance intended.\n\n\n\nFrom this came the idea to release two editions of Distress Signals:\n\n\n\nDistress Signals I - a completely remastered and restored edition of the original, rare Broken Flag tape.\n\n\n\nDistress Signals II - Lemos' intended recording, never before released and quite different from the Broken Flag tape.",

      "about": "Larva Lumps is a startling record: it somehow flawlessly mixes industrial noise and prog rock into a beautifully stream-of-conscious work that is at once fairly brutal and lovingly serene. The opening piece, Driving Through Darkness, could be the title of a pop-ballad, until you realize the actual meaning of the word 'driving'; jumping out at you seemingly in medias res, the album and track crash thru a minute of jazz-improv and clicking bass that give way to a delightful guitar, before grabbing you again on the road to darkness. The second track, Carving Song, is an industrial monster that sounds like the spawn of Test Dept. and Cubanate, and the epic, 22-minute long closer The Perks of Being a Perv, an instrumental throbbing piece of industrial-meets-prog confusion, is breathtaking.\n\n\n\nBoth vinyl and CD come with an album of bonus material, out-takes from the Larva Lumps sessions that both label and artists felt were far too strong to keep off the release. The bonus material was engineered by famed New York producer Martin Bisi (Swans, John Zorn, Boredoms, White Zombie, Bill Laswell, Foetus).\n\n\n\nThe 2CD comes in a lovely digipak. The 2LP edition is housed in a beautiful gatefold, and a bonus, collector's item version on swill green.",

      "about": "Artoffact Records is proud to announce the reissue of a significant portion of the Controlled Bleeding catalogue.\n\n\n\nAfter several tape-only releases in 1984, Controlled Bleeding released its first album on the then-brand new Dossier label in Germany, a label with which Controlled Bleeding would collaborate closely over the next years. Experimental, noise-laden industrial, Body Samples is at times less abrasive than the previous year's tape experiments and was influenced by ambient soundscapes and rhythmic noise of the mid-80s. The album also eschews the longer pieces found on the tape releases for a series of shorter works, many under two minutes, reflecting poignantly its name, Body Samples.\n\n\n\nBoth original vinyl and CD are hopelessly out of print, and the Artoffact Records reissues expand the original vinyl pressing with a healthy dose of unreleased bonus tracks into a gorgeous 2LP remastered edition.",

Broadrick from industrial-metal act Godflesh (not to mention Jesu), as well as Monolake, Crowhurst, Ramleh, Child Bite, and many others. Even notorious experimental guitarist (and current Lydia Lunch Retrovirus member) Weasel Walter makes an appearance.\n\n\n\nThe remixes range from straight up power noise, to post-black metal, to industrial-influenced beats, and are as varied as Controlled Bleeding itself, a project known for being impossible to classify. An essential release in the long, storied history of one of America’s foremost experimenters.",
