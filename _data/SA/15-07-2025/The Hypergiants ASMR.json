other.\n\nLong and short define each other.\n\nHigh and low depend on each other.\n\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master\n\nacts without doing anything\n\nand teaches without saying anything.\n\nThings arise and she lets them come;\n\nthings disappear and she lets them go.\n\nShe has but doesn't possess,\n\nacts but doesn't expect.\n\nWhen her work is done, she forgets it.\n\nThat is why it lasts forever.\n\n3\n\nIf you overesteem great men,\n\npeople become powerless.\n\nIf you overvalue possessions,\n\npeople begin to steal.\n\n\n\nThe Master leads\n\nby emptying people's minds\n\nand filling their cores,\n\nby weakening their ambition\n\nand toughening their resolve.\n\nHe helps people lose everything\n\nthey know, everything they desire,\n\nand creates confusion\n\nin those who think that they know.\n\n\n\nPractice not-doing,\n\nand everything will fall into place.\n\n4\n\nThe Tao is like a well:\n\nused but never used up.\n\nIt is like the eternal void:\n\nfilled with infinite possibilities.\n\n\n\nIt is hidden but always present.\n\nI don't know who gave birth to it.\n\nIt is older than God.\n\n5\n\nThe Tao doesn't take sides;\n\nit gives birth to both good and evil.\n\nThe Master doesn't take sides;\n\nshe welcomes both saints and sinners.\n\n\n\nThe Tao is like a bellows:\n\nit is empty yet infinitely capable.\n\nThe more you use it, the more it produces;\n\nthe more you talk of it, the less you understand.\n\n\n\nHold on to the center.\n\n6\n\nThe Tao is called the Great Mother:\n\nempty yet inexhaustible,\n\nit gives birth to infinite worlds.\n\n\n\nIt is always present within you.\n\nYou can use it any way you want.\n\n7\n\nThe Tao is infinite, eternal.\n\nWhy is it eternal?\n\nIt was never born;\n\nthus it can never die.\n\nWhy is it infinite?\n\nIt has no desires for itself;\n\nthus it is present for all beings.\n\n\n\nThe Master stays behind;\n\nthat is why she is ahead.\n\nShe is detached from all things;\n\nthat is why she is one with them.\n\nBecause she has let go of herself,\n\nshe is perfectly fulfilled.\n\n8\n\nThe supreme good is like water,\n\nwhich nourishes all things without trying to.\n\nIt is content with the low places that people disdain.\n\nThus it is like the Tao.\n\n\n\nIn dwelling, live close to the ground.\n\nIn thinking, keep to the simple.\n\nIn conflict, be fair and generous.\n\nIn governing, don't try to control.\n\nIn work, do what you enjoy.\n\nIn family life, be completely present.\n\n\n\nWhen you are content to be simply yourself\n\nand don't compare or compete,\n\neverybody will respect you.\n\n9\n\nFill your bowl to the brim\n\nand it will spill.\n\nKeep sharpening your knife\n\nand it will blunt.\n\nChase after money and security\n\nand your heart will never unclench.\n\nCare about people's approval\n\nand you will be their prisoner.\n\n\n\nDo your work, then step back.\n\nThe only path to serenity.\n\n10\n\nCan you coax your mind from its wandering\n\nand keep to the original oneness?\n\nCan you let your body become\n\nsupple as a newborn child's?\n\nCan you cleanse your inner vision\n\nuntil you see nothing but the light?\n\nCan you love people and lead them\n\nwithout imposing your will?\n\nCan you deal with the most vital matters\n\nby letting events take their course?\n\nCan you step back from you own mind\n\nand thus understand all things?\n\n\n\nGiving birth and nourishing,\n\nhaving without possessing,\n\nacting with no expectations,\n\nleading and not trying to control:\n\nthis is the supreme virtue.\n\n11\n\nWe join spokes together in a wheel,\n\nbut it is the center hole\n\nthat makes the wagon move.\n\n\n\nWe shape clay into a pot,\n\nbut it is the emptiness inside\n\nthat holds whatever we want.\n\n\n\nWe hammer wood for a house,\n\nbut it is the inner space\n\nthat makes it livable.\n\n\n\nWe work with being,\n\nbut non-being is what we use.\n\n12\n\nColors blind the eye.\n\nSounds deafen the ear.\n\nFlavors numb the taste.\n\nThoughts weaken the mind.\n\nDesires wither the heart.\n\n\n\nThe Master observes the world\n\nbut trusts his inner vision.\n\nHe allows things to come and go.\n\nHis heart is open as the sky.\n\n13\n\nSuccess is as dangerous as failure.\n\nHope is as hollow as fear.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean that success is a dangerous as failure?\n\nWhether you go up the ladder or down it,\n\nyou position is shaky.\n\nWhen you stand with your two feet on the ground,\n\nyou will always keep your balance.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean that hope is as hollow as fear?\n\nHope and fear are both phantoms\n\nthat arise from thinking of the self.\n\nWhen we don't see the self as self,\n\nwhat do we have to fear?\n\n\n\nSee the world as your self.\n\nHave faith in the way things are.\n\nLove the world as your self;\n\nthen you can care for all things.\n\n14\n\nLook, and it can't be seen.\n\nListen, and it can't be heard.\n\nReach, and it can't be grasped.\n\n\n\nAbove, it isn't bright.\n\nBelow, it isn't dark.\n\nSeamless, unnamable,\n\nit returns to the realm of nothing.\n\nForm that includes all forms,\n\nimage without an image,\n\nsubtle, beyond all conception.\n\n\n\nApproach it and there is no beginning;\n\nfollow it and there is no end.\n\nYou can't know it, but you can be it,\n\nat ease in your own life.\n\nJust realize where you come from:\n\nthis is the essence of wisdom.\n\n15\n\nThe ancient Masters were profound and subtle.\n\nTheir wisdom was unfathomable.\n\nThere is no way to describe it;\n\nall we can describe is their appearance.\n\n\n\nThey were careful\n\nas someone crossing an iced-over stream.\n\nAlert as a warrior in enemy territory.\n\nCourteous as a guest.\n\nFluid as melting ice.\n\nShapable as a block of wood.\n\nReceptive as a valley.\n\nClear as a glass of water.\n\n\n\nDo you have the patience to wait\n\ntill your mud settles and the water is clear?\n\nCan you remain unmoving\n\ntill the right action arises by itself?\n\n\n\nThe Master doesn't seek fulfillment.\n\nNot seeking, not expecting,\n\nshe is present, and can welcome all things.\n\n16\n\nEmpty your mind of all thoughts.\n\nLet your heart be at peace.\n\nWatch the turmoil of beings,\n\nbut contemplate their return.\n\n\n\nEach separate being in the universe\n\nreturns to the common source.\n\nReturning to the source is serenity.\n\n\n\nIf you don't realize the source,\n\nyou stumble in confusion and sorrow.\n\nWhen you realize where you come from,\n\nyou naturally become tolerant,\n\ndisinterested, amused,\n\nkindhearted as a grandmother,\n\ndignified as a king.\n\nImmersed in the wonder of the Tao,\n\nyou can deal with whatever life brings you,\n\nand when death comes, you are ready.\n\n17\n\nWhen the Master governs, the people\n\nare hardly aware that he exists.\n\nNext best is a leader who is loved.\n\nNext, one who is feared.\n\nThe worst is one who is despised.\n\n\n\nIf you don't trust the people,\n\nyou make them untrustworthy.\n\n\n\nThe Master doesn't talk, he acts.\n\nWhen his work is done,\n\nthe people say, \"Amazing:\n\nwe did it, all by ourselves!\"\n\n18\n\nWhen the great Tao is forgotten,\n\ngoodness and piety appear.\n\nWhen the body's intelligence declines,\n\ncleverness and knowledge step forth.\n\nWhen there is no peace in the family,\n\nfilial piety begins.\n\nWhen the country falls into chaos,\n\npatriotism is born.\n\n19\n\nThrow away holiness and wisdom,\n\nand people will be a hundred times happier.\n\nThrow away morality and justice,\n\nand people will do the right thing.\n\nThrow away industry and profit,\n\nand there won't be any thieves.\n\n\n\nIf these three aren't enough,\n\njust stay at the center of the circle\n\nand let all things take their course.\n\n20\n\nStop thinking, and end your problems.\n\nWhat difference between yes and no?\n\nWhat difference between success and failure?\n\nMust you value what others value,\n\navoid what others avoid?\n\nHow ridiculous!\n\n\n\nOther people are excited,\n\nas though they were at a parade.\n\nI alone don't care,\n\nI alone am expressionless,\n\nlike an infant before it can smile.\n\n\n\nOther people have what they need;\n\nI alone possess nothing.\n\nI alone drift about,\n\nlike someone without a home.\n\nI am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.\n\n\n\nOther people are bright;\n\nI alone am dark.\n\nOther people are sharper;\n\nI alone am dull.\n\nOther people have a purpose;\n\nI alone don't know.\n\nI drift like a wave on the ocean,\n\nI blow as aimless as the wind.\n\n\n\nI am different from ordinary people.\n\nI drink from the Great Mother's breasts.\n\n21\n\nThe Master keeps her mind\n\nalways at one with the Tao;\n\nthat is what gives her her radiance.\n\n\n\nThe Tao is ungraspable.\n\nHow can her mind be at one with it?\n\nBecause she doesn't cling to ideas.\n\n\n\nThe Tao is dark and unfathomable.\n\nHow can it make her radiant?\n\nBecause she lets it.\n\n\n\nSince before time and space were,\n\nthe Tao is.\n\nIt is beyond is and is not.\n\nHow do I know this is true?\n\nI look inside myself and see.\n\n22\n\nIf you want to become whole,\n\nlet yourself be partial.\n\nIf you want to become straight,\n\nlet yourself be crooked.\n\nIf you want to become full,\n\nlet yourself be empty.\n\nIf you want to be reborn,\n\nlet yourself die.\n\nIf you want to be given everything,\n\ngive everything up.\n\n\n\nThe Master, by residing in the Tao,\n\nsets an example for all beings.\n\nBecause he doesn't display himself,\n\npeople can see his light.\n\nBecause he has nothing to prove,\n\npeople can trust his words.\n\nBecause he doesn't know who he is,\n\npeople recognize themselves in him.\n\nBecause he has no goad in mind,\n\neverything he does succeeds.\n\n\n\nWhen the ancient Masters said,\n\n\"If you want to be given everything,\n\ngive everything up,\"\n\nthey weren't using empty phrases.\n\nOnly in being lived by the Tao can you be truly yourself.\n\n23\n\nExpress yourself completely,\n\nthen keep quiet.\n\nBe like the forces of nature:\n\nwhen it blows, there is only wind;\n\nwhen it rains, there is only rain;\n\nwhen the clouds pass, the sun shines through.\n\n\n\nIf you open yourself to the Tao,\n\nyou are at one with the Tao\n\nand you can embody it completely.\n\nIf you open yourself to insight,\n\nyou are at one with insight\n\nand you can use it completely.\n\nIf you open yourself to loss,\n\nyou are at one with loss\n\nand you can accept it completely.\n\n\n\nOpen yourself to the Tao,\n\nthen trust your natural responses;\n\nand everything will fall into place.\n\n24\n\nHe who stands on tiptoe\n\ndoesn't stand form.\n\nHe who rushes ahead\n\ndoesn't go far.\n\nHe who tries to shine\n\ndims his own light.\n\nHe who defines himself\n\ncan't know who he really is.\n\nHe who has power over others\n\ncan't empower himself.\n\nHe who clings to his work\n\nwill create nothing that endures.\n\n\n\nIf you want to accord with the Tao,\n\njust do your job, then let go.\n\n25\n\nThere was something formless and perfect\n\nbefore the universe was born.\n\nIt is serene. Empty.\n\nSolitary. Unchanging.\n\nInfinite. Eternally present.\n\nIt is the mother of the universe.\n\nFor lack of a better name,\n\nI call it the Tao.\n\n\n\nIt flows through all things,\n\ninside and outside, and returns\n\nto the origin of all things.\n\n\n\nThe Tao is great.\n\nThe universe is great.\n\nEarth is great.\n\nMan is great.\n\nThese are the four great powers.\n\n\n\nMan follows the earth.\n\nEarth follows the universe.\n\nThe universe follows the Tao.\n\nThe Tao follows only itself.\n\n26\n\nThe heavy is the root of the light.\n\nThe unmoved is the source of all movement.\n\n\n\nThus the Master travels all day\n\nwithout leaving home.\n\nHowever splendid the views,\n\nshe stays serenely in herself.\n\n\n\nWhy should the lord of the country\n\nflit about like a fool?\n\nIf you let yourself be blown to and fro,\n\nyou lose touch with your root.\n\nIf you let restlessness move you,\n\nyou lose touch with who you are.\n\n27\n\nA good traveler has no fixed plans\n\nand is not intent upon arriving.\n\nA good artist lets his intuition\n\nlead him wherever it wants.\n\nA good scientist has freed himself of concepts\n\nand keeps his mind open to what is.\n\n\n\nThus the Master is available to all people\n\nand doesn't reject anyone.\n\nHe is ready to use all situations\n\nand doesn't waste anything.\n\nThis is called embodying the light.\n\n\n\nWhat is a good man but a bad man's teacher?\n\nWhat is a bad man but a good man's job?\n\nIf you don't understand this, you will get lost,\n\nhowever intelligent you are.\n\nIt is the great secret.\n\n28\n\nKnow the male,\n\nyet keep to the female:\n\nreceive the world in your arms.\n\nIf you receive the world,\n\nthe Tao will never leave you\n\nand you will be like a little child.\n\n\n\nKnow the white,\n\nyet keep to the black:\n\nbe a pattern for the world.\n\nIf you are a pattern for the world,\n\nthe Tao will be strong inside you\n\nand there will be nothing you can't do.\n\n\n\nKnow the personal,\n\nyet keep to the impersonal:\n\naccept the world as it is.\n\nIf you accept the world,\n\nthe Tao will be luminous inside you\n\nand you will return to your primal self.\n\n\n\nThe world is formed from the void,\n\nlike utensils from a block of wood.\n\nThe Master knows the utensils,\n\nyet keeps to the the block:\n\nthus she can use all things.\n\n29\n\nDo you want to improve the world?\n\nI don't think it can be done.\n\n\n\nThe world is sacred.\n\nIt can't be improved.\n\nIf you tamper with it, you'll ruin it.\n\nIf you treat it like an object, you'll lose it.\n\n\n\nThere is a time for being ahead,\n\na time for being behind;\n\na time for being in motion,\n\na time for being at rest;\n\na time for being vigorous,\n\na time for being exhausted;\n\na time for being safe,\n\na time for being in danger.\n\n\n\nThe Master sees things as they are,\n\nwithout trying to control them.\n\nShe lets them go their own way,\n\nand resides at the center of the circle.\n\n30\n\nWhoever relies on the Tao in governing men\n\ndoesn't try to force issues\n\nor defeat enemies by force of arms.\n\nFor every force there is a counterforce.\n\nViolence, even well intentioned,\n\nalways rebounds upon oneself.\n\n\n\nThe Master does his job\n\nand then stops.\n\nHe understands that the universe\n\nis forever out of control,\n\nand that trying to dominate events\n\ngoes against the current of the Tao.\n\nBecause he believes in himself,\n\nhe doesn't try to convince others.\n\nBecause he is content with himself,\n\nhe doesn't need others' approval.\n\nBecause he accepts himself,\n\nthe whole world accepts him.\n\n31\n\nWeapons are the tools of violence;\n\nall decent men detest them.\n\n\n\nWeapons are the tools of fear;\n\na decent man will avoid them\n\nexcept in the direst necessity\n\nand, if compelled, will use them\n\nonly with the utmost restraint.\n\nPeace is his highest value.\n\nIf the peace has been shattered,\n\nhow can he be content?\n\nHis enemies are not demons,\n\nbut human beings like himself.\n\nHe doesn't wish them personal harm.\n\nNor does he rejoice in victory.\n\nHow could he rejoice in victory\n\nand delight in the slaughter of men?\n\n\n\nHe enters a battle gravely,\n\nwith sorrow and with great compassion,\n\nas if he were attending a funeral.\n\n32\n\nThe Tao can't be perceived.\n\nSmaller than an electron,\n\nit contains uncountable galaxies.\n\n\n\nIf powerful men and women\n\ncould remain centered in the Tao,\n\nall things would be in harmony.\n\nThe world would become a paradise.\n\nAll people would be at peace,\n\nand the law would be written in their hearts.\n\n\n\nWhen you have names and forms,\n\nknow that they are provisional.\n\nWhen you have institutions,\n\nknow where their functions should end.\n\nKnowing when to stop,\n\nyou can avoid any danger.\n\n\n\nAll things end in the Tao\n\nas rivers flow into the sea.\n\n33\n\nKnowing others is intelligence;\n\nknowing yourself is true wisdom.\n\nMastering others is strength;\n\nmastering yourself is true power.\n\n\n\nIf you realize that you have enough,\n\nyou are truly rich.\n\nIf you stay in the center\n\nand embrace death with your whole heart,\n\nyou will endure forever.\n\n34\n\nThe great Tao flows everywhere.\n\nAll things are born from it,\n\nyet it doesn't create them.\n\nIt pours itself into its work,\n\nyet it makes no claim.\n\nIt nourishes infinite worlds,\n\nyet it doesn't hold on to them.\n\nSince it is merged with all things\n\nand hidden in their hearts,\n\nit can be called humble.\n\nSince all things vanish into it\n\nand it alone endures,\n\nit can be called great.\n\nIt isn't aware of its greatness;\n\nthus it is truly great.\n\n\n\n35\n\nShe who is centered in the Tao\n\ncan go where she wishes, without danger.\n\nShe perceives the universal harmony,\n\neven amid great pain,\n\nbecause she has found peace in her heart.\n\n\n\nMusic or the smell of good cooking\n\nmay make people stop and enjoy.\n\nBut words that point to the Tao\n\nseem monotonous and without flavor.\n\nWhen you look for it, there is nothing to see.\n\nWhen you listen for it, there is nothing to hear.\n\nWhen you use it, it is inexhaustible.\n\n36\n\nIf you want to shrink something,\n\nyou must first allow it to expand.\n\nIf you want to get rid of something,\n\nyou must first allow it to flourish.\n\nIf you want to take something,\n\nyou must first allow it to be given.\n\nThis is called the subtle perception\n\nof the way things are.\n\n\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\n\nThe slow overcomes the fast.\n\nLet your workings remain a mystery.\n\nJust show people the results.\n\n37\n\nThe Tao never does anything,\n\nyet through it all things are done.\n\n\n\nIf powerful men and women\n\ncould venter themselves in it,\n\nthe whole world would be transformed\n\nby itself, in its natural rhythms.\n\nPeople would be content\n\nwith their simple, everyday lives,\n\nin harmony, and free of desire.\n\n\n\nWhen there is no desire,\n\nall things are at peace.\n\n38\n\nThe Master doesn't try to be powerful;\n\nthus he is truly powerful.\n\nThe ordinary man keeps reaching for power;\n\nthus he never has enough.\n\n\n\nThe Master does nothing,\n\nyet he leaves nothing undone.\n\nThe ordinary man is always doing things,\n\nyet many more are left to be done.\n\n\n\nThe kind man does something,\n\nyet something remains undone.\n\nThe just man does something,\n\nand leaves many things to be done.\n\nThe moral man does something,\n\nand when no one responds\n\nhe rolls up his sleeves and uses force.\n\n\n\nWhen the Tao is lost, there is goodness.\n\nWhen goodness is lost, there is morality.\n\nWhen morality is lost, there is ritual.\n\nRitual is the husk of true faith,\n\nthe beginning of chaos.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master concerns himself\n\nwith the depths and not the surface,\n\nwith the fruit and not the flower.\n\nHe has no will of his own.\n\nHe dwells in reality,\n\nand lets all illusions go.\n\n39\n\nIn harmony with the Tao,\n\nthe sky is clear and spacious,\n\nthe earth is solid and full,\n\nall creature flourish together,\n\ncontent with the way they are,\n\nendlessly repeating themselves,\n\nendlessly renewed.\n\n\n\nWhen man interferes with the Tao,\n\nthe sky becomes filthy,\n\nthe earth becomes depleted,\n\nthe equilibrium crumbles,\n\ncreatures become extinct.\n\n\n\nThe Master views the parts with compassion,\n\nbecause he understands the whole.\n\nHis constant practice is humility.\n\nHe doesn't glitter like a jewel\n\nbut lets himself be shaped by the Tao,\n\nas rugged and common as stone.\n\n40\n\nReturn is the movement of the Tao.\n\nYielding is the way of the Tao.\n\n\n\nAll things are born of being.\n\nBeing is born of non-being.\n\n41\n\nWhen a superior man hears of the Tao,\n\nhe immediately begins to embody it.\n\nWhen an average man hears of the Tao,\n\nhe half believes it, half doubts it.\n\nWhen a foolish man hears of the Tao,\n\nhe laughs out loud.\n\nIf he didn't laugh,\n\nit wouldn't be the Tao.\n\n\n\nThus it is said:\n\nThe path into the light seems dark,\n\nthe path forward seems to go back,\n\nthe direct path seems long,\n\ntrue power seems weak,\n\ntrue purity seems tarnished,\n\ntrue steadfastness seems changeable,\n\ntrue clarity seems obscure,\n\nthe greatest are seems unsophisticated,\n\nthe greatest love seems indifferent,\n\nthe greatest wisdom seems childish.\n\n\n\nThe Tao is nowhere to be found.\n\nYet it nourishes and completes all things.\n\n42\n\nThe Tao gives birth to One.\n\nOne gives birth to Two.\n\nTwo gives birth to Three.\n\nThree gives birth to all things.\n\n\n\nAll things have their backs to the female\n\nand stand facing the male.\n\nWhen male and female combine,\n\nall things achieve harmony.\n\n\n\nOrdinary men hate solitude.\n\nBut the Master makes use of it,\n\nembracing his aloneness, realizing\n\nhe is one with the whole universe.\n\n43\n\nThe gentlest thing in the world\n\novercomes the hardest thing in the world.\n\nThat which has no substance\n\nenters where there is no space.\n\nThis shows the value of non-action.\n\n\n\nTeaching without words,\n\nperforming without actions:\n\nthat is the Master's way.\n\n44\n\nFame or integrity: which is more important?\n\nMoney or happiness: which is more valuable?\n\nSuccess of failure: which is more destructive?\n\n\n\nIf you look to others for fulfillment,\n\nyou will never truly be fulfilled.\n\nIf your happiness depends on money,\n\nyou will never be happy with yourself.\n\n\n\nBe content with what you have;\n\nrejoice in the way things are.\n\nWhen you realize there is nothing lacking,\n\nthe whole world belongs to you.\n\n45\n\nTrue perfection seems imperfect,\n\nyet it is perfectly itself.\n\nTrue fullness seems empty,\n\nyet it is fully present.\n\n\n\nTrue straightness seems crooked.\n\nTrue wisdom seems foolish.\n\nTrue art seems artless.\n\n\n\nThe Master allows things to happen.\n\nShe shapes events as they come.\n\nShe steps out of the way\n\nand lets the Tao speak for itself.\n\n46\n\nWhen a country is in harmony with the Tao,\n\nthe factories make trucks and tractors.\n\nWhen a country goes counter to the Tao,\n\nwarheads are stockpiled outside the cities.\n\n\n\nThere is no greater illusion than fear,\n\nno greater wrong than preparing to defend yourself,\n\nno greater misfortune than having an enemy.\n\n\n\nWhoever can see through all fear\n\nwill always be safe.\n\n47\n\nWithout opening your door,\n\nyou can open your heart to the world.\n\nWithout looking out your window,\n\nyou can see the essence of the Tao.\n\n\n\nThe more you know,\n\nthe less you understand.\n\n\n\nThe Master arrives without leaving,\n\nsees the light without looking,\n\nachieves without doing a thing.\n\n48\n\nIn pursuit of knowledge,\n\nevery day something is added.\n\nIn the practice of the Tao,\n\nevery day something is dropped.\n\nLess and less do you need to force things,\n\nuntil finally you arrive at non-action.\n\nWhen nothing is done,\n\nnothing is left undone.\n\n\n\nTrue mastery can be gained\n\nby letting things go their own way.\n\nIt can't be gained by interfering.\n\n49\n\nThe Master has no mind of her own.\n\nShe works with the mind of the people.\n\n\n\nShe is good to people who are good.\n\nShe is also good to people who aren't good.\n\nThis is true goodness.\n\n\n\nShe trusts people who are trustworthy.\n\nShe also trusts people who aren't trustworthy.\n\nThis is true trust.\n\n\n\nThe Master's mind is like space.\n\nPeople don't understand her.\n\nThey look to her and wait.\n\nShe treats them like her own children.\n\n50\n\nThe Master gives himself up\n\nto whatever the moment brings.\n\nHe knows that he is going to die,\n\nand her has nothing left to hold on to:\n\nno illusions in his mind,\n\nno resistances in his body.\n\nHe doesn't think about his actions;\n\nthey flow from the core of his being.\n\nHe holds nothing back from life;\n\ntherefore he is ready for death,\n\nas a man is ready for sleep\n\nafter a good day's work.\n\n51\n\nEvery being in the universe\n\nis an expression of the Tao.\n\nIt springs into existence,\n\nunconscious, perfect, free,\n\ntakes on a physical body,\n\nlets circumstances complete it.\n\nThat is why every being\n\nspontaneously honors the Tao.\n\n\n\nThe Tao gives birth to all beings,\n\nnourishes them, maintains them,\n\ncares for them, comforts them, protects them,\n\ntakes them back to itself,\n\ncreating without possessing,\n\nacting without expecting,\n\nguiding without interfering.\n\nThat is why love of the Tao\n\nis in the very nature of things.\n\n52\n\nIn the beginning was the Tao.\n\nAll things issue from it;\n\nall things return to it.\n\n\n\nTo find the origin,\n\ntrace back the manifestations.\n\nWhen you recognize the children\n\nand find the mother,\n\nyou will be free of sorrow.\n\n\n\nIf you close your mind in judgements\n\nand traffic with desires,\n\nyour heart will be troubled.\n\nIf you keep your mind from judging\n\nand aren't led by the senses,\n\nyour heart will find peace.\n\n\n\nSeeing into darkness is clarity.\n\nKnowing how to yield is strength.\n\nUse your own light\n\nand return to the source of light.\n\nThis is called practicing eternity.\n\n53\n\nThe great Way is easy,\n\nyet people prefer the side paths.\n\nBe aware when things are out of balance.\n\nStay centered within the Tao.\n\n\n\nWhen rich speculators prosper\n\nWhile farmers lose their land;\n\nwhen government officials spend money\n\non weapons instead of cures;\n\nwhen the upper class is extravagant and irresponsible\n\nwhile the poor have nowhere to turn-\n\nall this is robbery and chaos.\n\nIt is not in keeping with the Tao.\n\n54\n\nWhoever is planted in the Tao\n\nwill not be rooted up.\n\nWhoever embraces the Tao\n\nwill not slip away.\n\nHer name will be held in honor\n\nfrom generation to generation.\n\n\n\nLet the Tao be present in your life\n\nand you will become genuine.\n\nLet it be present in your family\n\nand your family will flourish.\n\nLet it be present in your country\n\nand your country will be an example\n\nto all countries in the world.\n\nLet it be present in the universe\n\nand the universe will sing.\n\n\n\nHow do I know this is true?\n\nBy looking inside myself.\n\n55\n\nHe who is in harmony with the Tao\n\nis like a newborn child.\n\nIts bones are soft, its muscles are weak,\n\nbut its grip is powerful.\n\nIt doesn't know about the union\n\nof male and female,\n\nyet its penis can stand erect,\n\nso intense is its vital power.\n\nIt can scream its head off all day,\n\nyet it never becomes hoarse,\n\nso complete is its harmony.\n\n\n\nThe Master's power is like this.\n\nHe lets all things come and go\n\neffortlessly, without desire.\n\nHe never expects results;\n\nthus he is never disappointed.\n\nHe is never disappointed;\n\nthus his spirit never grows old.\n\n56\n\nThose who know don't talk.\n\nThose who talk don't know.\n\n\n\nClose your mouth,\n\nblock off your senses,\n\nblunt your sharpness,\n\nuntie your knots,\n\nsoften your glare,\n\nsettle your dust.\n\nThis is the primal identity.\n\n\n\nBe like the Tao.\n\nIt can't be approached or withdrawn from,\n\nbenefited or harmed,\n\nhonored or brought into disgrace.\n\nIt gives itself up continually.\n\nThat is why it endures.\n\n57\n\nIf you want to be a great leader,\n\nyou must learn to follow the Tao.\n\nStop trying to control.\n\nLet go of fixed plans and concepts,\n\nand the world will govern itself.\n\n\n\nThe more prohibitions you have,\n\nthe less virtuous people will be.\n\nThe more weapons you have,\n\nthe less secure people will be.\n\nThe more subsidies you have,\n\nthe less self-reliant people will be.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master says:\n\nI let go of the law,\n\nand people become honest.\n\nI let go of economics,\n\nand people become prosperous.\n\nI let go of religion,\n\nand people become serene.\n\nI let go of all desire for the common good,\n\nand the good becomes common as grass.\n\n58\n\nIf a country is governed with tolerance,\n\nthe people are comfortable and honest.\n\nIf a country is governed with repression,\n\nthe people are depressed and crafty.\n\n\n\nWhen the will to power is in charge,\n\nthe higher the ideals, the lower the results.\n\nTry to make people happy,\n\nand you lay the groundwork for misery.\n\nTry to make people moral,\n\nand you lay the groundwork for vice.\n\n\n\nThus the Master is content\n\nto serve as an example\n\nand not to impose her will.\n\nShe is pointed, but doesn't pierce.\n\nStraightforward, but supple.\n\nRadiant, but easy on the eyes.\n\n59\n\nFor governing a country well\n\nthere is nothing better than moderation.\n\n\n\nThe mark of a moderate man\n\nis freedom from his own ideas.\n\nTolerant like the sky,\n\nall-pervading like sunlight,\n\nfirm like a mountain,\n\nsupple like a tree in the wind,\n\nhe has no destination in view\n\nand makes use of anything\n\nlife happens to bring his way.\n\n\n\nNothing is impossible for him.\n\nBecause he has let go,\n\nhe can care for the people's welfare\n\nas a mother cares for her child.\n\n60\n\nGoverning a large country\n\nis like frying a small fish.\n\nYou spoil it with too much poking.\n\n\n\nCenter your country in the Tao\n\nand evil will have no power.\n\nNot that it isn't there,\n\nbut you'll be able to step out of its way.\n\n\n\nGive evil nothing to oppose\n\nand it will disappear by itself.\n\n61\n\nWhen a country obtains great power,\n\nit becomes like the sea:\n\nall streams run downward into it.\n\nThe more powerful it grows,\n\nthe greater the need for humility.\n\nHumility means trusting the Tao,\n\nthus never needing to be defensive.\n\n\n\nA great nation is like a great man:\n\nWhen he makes a mistake, he realizes it.\n\nHaving realized it, he admits it.\n\nHaving admitted it, he corrects it.\n\nHe considers those who point out his faults\n\nas his most benevolent teachers.\n\nHe thinks of his enemy\n\nas the shadow that he himself casts.\n\n\n\nIf a nation is centered in the Tao,\n\nif it nourishes its own people\n\nand doesn't meddle in the affairs of others,\n\nit will be a light to all nations in the world.\n\n62\n\nThe Tao is the center of the universe,\n\nthe good man's treasure,\n\nthe bad man's refuge.\n\n\n\nHonors can be bought with fine words,\n\nrespect can be won with good deeds;\n\nbut the Tao is beyond all value,\n\nand no one can achieve it.\n\n\n\nThus, when a new leader is chosen,\n\ndon't offer to help him\n\nwith your wealth or your expertise.\n\nOffer instead\n\nto teach him about the Tao.\n\n\n\nWhy did the ancient Masters esteem the Tao?\n\nBecause, being one with the Tao,\n\nwhen you seek, you find;\n\nand when you make a mistake, you are forgiven.\n\nThat is why everybody loves it.\n\n63\n\nAct without doing;\n\nwork without effort.\n\nThink of the small as large\n\nand the few as many.\n\nConfront the difficult\n\nwhile it is still easy;\n\naccomplish the great task\n\nby a series of small acts.\n\n\n\nThe Master never reaches for the great;\n\nthus she achieves greatness.\n\nWhen she runs into a difficulty,\n\nshe stops and gives herself to it.\n\nShe doesn't cling to her own comfort;\n\nthus problems are no problem for her.\n\n64\n\nWhat is rooted is easy to nourish.\n\nWhat is recent is easy to correct.\n\nWhat is brittle is easy to break.\n\nWhat is small is easy to scatter.\n\n\n\nPrevent trouble before it arises.\n\nPut things in order before they exist.\n\nThe giant pine tree\n\ngrows from a tiny sprout.\n\nThe journey of a thousand miles\n\nstarts from beneath your feet.\n\n\n\nRushing into action, you fail.\n\nTrying to grasp things, you lose them.\n\nForcing a project to completion,\n\nyou ruin what was almost ripe.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master takes action\n\nby letting things take their course.\n\nHe remains as calm\n\nat the end as at the beginning.\n\nHe has nothing,\n\nthus has nothing to lose.\n\nWhat he desires is non-desire;\n\nwhat he learns is to unlearn.\n\nHe simply reminds people\n\nof who they have always been.\n\nHe cares about nothing but the Tao.\n\nThus he can care for all things.\n\n65\n\nThe ancient Masters\n\ndidn't try to educate the people,\n\nbut kindly taught them to not-know.\n\n\n\nWhen they think that they know the answers,\n\npeople are difficult to guide.\n\nWhen they know that they don't know,\n\npeople can find their own way.\n\n\n\nIf you want to learn how to govern,\n\navoid being clever or rich.\n\nThe simplest pattern is the clearest.\n\nContent with an ordinary life,\n\nyou can show all people the way\n\nback to their own true nature.\n\n66\n\nAll streams flow to the sea\n\nbecause it is lower than they are.\n\nHumility gives it its power.\n\n\n\nIf you want to govern the people,\n\nyou must place yourself below them.\n\nIf you want to lead the people,\n\nyou must learn how to follow them.\n\n\n\nThe Master is above the people,\n\nand no one feels oppressed.\n\nShe goes ahead of the people,\n\nand no one feels manipulated.\n\nThe whole world is grateful to her.\n\nBecause she competes with no one,\n\nno one can compete with her.\n\n67\n\nSome say that my teaching is nonsense.\n\nOthers call it lofty but impractical.\n\nBut to those who have looked inside themselves,\n\nthis nonsense makes perfect sense.\n\nAnd to those who put it into practice,\n\nthis loftiness has roots that go deep.\n\n\n\nI have just three things to teach:\n\nsimplicity, patience, compassion.\n\nThese three are your greatest treasures.\n\nSimple in actions and in thoughts,\n\nyou return to the source of being.\n\nPatient with both friends and enemies,\n\nyou accord with the way things are.\n\nCompassionate toward yourself,\n\nyou reconcile all beings in the world.\n\n68\n\nThe best athlete\n\nwants his opponent at his best.\n\nThe best general\n\nenters the mind of his enemy.\n\nThe best businessman\n\nserves the communal good.\n\nThe best leader\n\nfollows the will of the people.\n\n\n\nAll of the embody\n\nthe virtue of non-competition.\n\nNot that they don't love to compete,\n\nbut they do it in the spirit of play.\n\nIn this they are like children\n\nand in harmony with the Tao.\n\n69\n\nThe generals have a saying:\n\n\"Rather than make the first move\n\nit is better to wait and see.\n\nRather than advance an inch\n\nit is better to retreat a yard.\"\n\n\n\nThis is called\n\ngoing forward without advancing,\n\npushing back without using weapons.\n\n\n\nThere is no greater misfortune\n\nthan underestimating your enemy.\n\nUnderestimating your enemy\n\nmeans thinking that he is evil.\n\nThus you destroy your three treasures\n\nand become an enemy yourself.\n\n\n\nWhen two great forces oppose each other,\n\nthe victory will go\n\nto the one that knows how to yield.\n\n70\n\nMy teachings are easy to understand\n\nand easy to put into practice.\n\nYet your intellect will never grasp them,\n\nand if you try to practice them, you'll fail.\n\n\n\nMy teachings are older than the world.\n\nHow can you grasp their meaning?\n\n\n\nIf you want to know me,\n\nlook inside your heart.\n\n71\n\nNot-knowing is true knowledge.\n\nPresuming to know is a disease.\n\nFirst realize that you are sick;\n\nthen you can move toward health.\n\n\n\nThe Master is her own physician.\n\nShe has healed herself of all knowing.\n\nThus she is truly whole.\n\n72\n\nWhen they lose their sense of awe,\n\npeople turn to religion.\n\nWhen they no longer trust themselves,\n\nthey begin to depend upon authority.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master steps back\n\nso that people won't be confused.\n\nHe teaches without a teaching,\n\nso that people will have nothing to learn.\n\n73\n\nThe Tao is always at ease.\n\nIt overcomes without competing,\n\nanswers without speaking a word,\n\narrives without being summoned,\n\naccomplishes without a plan.\n\n\n\nIts net covers the whole universe.\n\nAnd though its meshes are wide,\n\nit doesn't let a thing slip through.\n\n74\n\nIf you realize that all things change,\n\nthere is nothing you will try to hold on to.\n\nIf you aren't afraid of dying,\n\nthere is nothing you can't achieve.\n\n\n\nTrying to control the future\n\nis like trying to take the master carpenter's place.\n\nWhen you handle the master carpenter's tools,\n\nchances are that you'll cut your hand.\n\n75\n\nWhen taxes are too high,\n\npeople go hungry.\n\nWhen the government is too intrusive,\n\npeople lose their spirit.\n\n\n\nAct for the people's benefit.\n\nTrust them; leave them alone.\n\n76\n\nMen are born soft and supple;\n\ndead, they are stiff and hard.\n\nPlats are born tender and pliant;\n\ndead, they are brittle and dry.\n\n\n\nThus whoever is stiff and inflexible\n\nis a disciple of death.\n\nWhoever is soft and yielding\n\nis a disciple of life.\n\n\n\nThe hard and stiff will be broken.\n\nThe soft and supple will prevail.\n\n77\n\nAs it acts in the world, the Tao\n\nis like the bending of a bow.\n\nThe top is bent downward;\n\nthe bottom is bent up.\n\nIt adjusts excess and deficiency\n\nso that there is perfect balance.\n\nIt takes from what is too much\n\nand give to what isn't enough.\n\n\n\nThose who try to control,\n\nwho use force to protect their power,\n\ngo against the direction of the Tao.\n\nThey take from those who don't have enough\n\nand give to those who have far too much.\n\n\n\nThe Master can keep giving\n\nbecause there is no end to her wealth.\n\nShe acts without expectation,\n\nsucceeds without taking credit,\n\nand doesn't think that she is better\n\nthan anyone else.\n\n78\n\nNothing in the world\n\nis as soft and yielding as water.\n\nYet for dissolving the hard and inflexible,\n\nnothing can surpass it.\n\n\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard;\n\nthe gentle overcomes the rigid.\n\nEveryone knows this is true,\n\nbut few can put it into practice.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master remains\n\nserene in the midst of sorrow.\n\nEvil cannot enter his heart.\n\nBecause he has given up helping,\n\nhe is people's greatest help.\n\n\n\nTrue words seem paradoxical.\n\n79\n\nFailure is an opportunity.\n\nIf you blame someone else,\n\nthere is no end to the blame.\n\n\n\nTherefore the Master\n\nfulfills her own obligations\n\nand corrects her own mistakes.\n\nShe does what she needs to do\n\nand demands nothing of others.\n\n80\n\nIf a country is governed wisely,\n\nits inhabitants will be content.\n\nThey enjoy the labor of their hands\n\nand don't waste time inventing\n\nlabor-saving machines.\n\nSince they dearly love their homes,\n\nthey aren't interested in travel.\n\nThere may be a few wagons and boats,\n\nbut these don't go anywhere.\n\nThere may be an arsenal of weapons,\n\nbut nobody ever uses them.\n\nPeople enjoy their food,\n\ntake pleasure in being with their families,\n\nspend weekends working in their gardens,\n\ndelight in the doings of the neighborhood.\n\nAnd even though the next country is so close\n\nthat people can hear its roosters crowing and its dogs barking,\n\nthey are content to die of old age\n\nwithout ever having gone to see it.\n\n81\n\nTrue words aren't eloquent;\n\neloquent words aren't true.\n\nWise men don't need to prove their point;\n\nmen who need to prove their point aren't wise.\n\n\n\nThe Master has no possessions.\n\nThe more he does for others,\n\nthe happier he is.\n\nThe more he gives to others,\n\nthe wealthier he is.\n\n\n\nThe Tao nourishes by not forcing.\n\nBy not dominating, the Master leads.",

Near them, on the sand,\n\nHalf sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,\n\nAnd wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,\n\nTell that its sculptor well those passions read\n\nWhich yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,\n\nThe hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:\n\n\n\nAnd on the pedestal these words appear:\n\n'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:\n\nLook on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'\n\nNothing beside remains. Round the decay\n\nOf that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\n\nThe lone and level sands stretch far away.\n\n\n\nr e l a x",

      "about": "Throughout history curses have been part of the program to instill the Fear Factor into the human experience. Curses often about relationships and the polar opposite of Fear - Love. If you allow yourself to believe in a curse, you can manifest that energy. Fear can manifest all sorts of lower frequency emotions. In this timeline, we move into the positive light and all curses are broken by our intent to erase them.\n\n\n\nDid you ever believe that someone has cast a spell/curse on you? In this life time?\n\n\n\nDo you refer to this as a psychic attack?\n\n\n\nDo you believe the energies can be reversed?\n\n\n\nEnergies can be reversed and destroyed.\n\n\n\nAs with illness - you must examine the reason this is happening to you, more to the point, why you are allowing it to happen to you. Are you sure you are not enjoying this dysfunctional aspect of the game to experience negative emotions linked to fear? This experience is mostly likely part of your DNA genetic blueprint, culturally linked, perhaps. This is all about dysfunctional people, places and events.\n\n\n\nLook internally, then externally, then spiritually, working with energies. Use candles if you feel guided/ignited. Place yourself in balance. Surround yourself in white light and turn the energies away. If they cannot penetrate or line up with your grid matrix, they will not affect you. It's that simple, but you must clear the emotional connection with you and what you believe is the curse or psychic attack. Most of all, don't believe everything these people tell you.\n\n\n\nPower is higher consciousness, therefore it is internal thought and can be acquired. When you pray, if you shift your grid, by the power of attraction will get what you are meant to experience - what you attract into your life.\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been asked if I can erase curses. That is not my function here. You must do it yourself.\n\n\n\nCurses are part of old programs - old world thinking and paradigms that date back to the beginning of the program. That's all all changing. Move away from the old. Disconnect. Reality is bringing you many opportunities for change. Seize the moment. Get help.\n\n\n\nStop playing the wounded soul!\n\n\n\nAll curses, once created, are meant to be broken by the strong, those who have personal power, while the weak wallow in self-doubt and self-pity and give their power over to negativity and dysfunctional people.",

      "about": "Hello and thank you for enjoying this Album of very \"beautiful\" music. The story of this album and how it was created is a bit complicated. In 2002 I aquired my first guitar. This album is crafted from samples of music I recorded from 2005-2006. In the autumn of 2006 I had a mental break down and I ran away from home and I fully accepted that I would probably never do music ever again. \n\n\n\nThese recordings would stay in my old computer until 2012 when I went back home to bury my mother. I put all these degrading .mp3 files on a dusty thumb drive that I recovered and they would stay dormant in a drawer for another 2 years until I became friends with Donald Gill and Alice Roelh, the founders of No Homes In Peace. They invited me to make music on their label. \n\n\n\nThis album is a collage of all those overwhelming teenage emotions and songs written at 3am. Half smoked cigarettes and streetlights. This album was the end of a 10 year circle in time. My life has been filled with these 10 year circles in time. This album is the full circle of my initiation, departure, and return to music as an expressive artform.\n\n\n\nBad things can happen to you, but that doesn't mean that good things won't happen for you either. You can recover from anything, as long as you believe in yourself and keep moving forward. Everything will be okay.\n\n\n\nThank you for enjoying this music.",
