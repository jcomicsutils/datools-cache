      "about": "LAIKA WORLD is a collaborative album by Aidan Baker, Jack Chuter, and Ryan Durfee, created in tribute to Laika, the Soviet space dog who became the first animal to orbit Earth aboard Sputnik 2 on November 3, 1957.\n\n\n\nThe album is a sonic blend of diverse influences, including Dean Hurley, SpaceGhostPurrp, Starflyer 59, Emeralds, Flying Saucer Attack, painter Morris Graves, and the films of Renee Harmon and Takeshi Kitano. Birdsong detonates from within sweeps of reverbed guitar, synthesiser and hypnagogic vocal spill, while frenetic drums keep an intermittent sense of time.\n\n\n\nIdeal for those who enjoy late-night conversations and the vivid dreams that follow.\n\n\n\nLimited cassette available from Cruel Nature Recordings: \n\n\n\ncruelnaturerecordings.bandcamp.com/album/laika-world",
