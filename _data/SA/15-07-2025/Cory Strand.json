      "about": "Drone rework of an awesome but obscure metalcore compilation featuring live sets from seven different bands. I was very into this shit then, still love a lot of it to this day; I bought this CD in 1997 and it's a remained a favorite document of mine since. I especially liked how it interspersed samples from \"Dead Poets Society\" throughout, so the whole thing felt like a sort of focused statement on expectation/sorrow/disenchantment/suicide.\n\nI've kept those samples intact in my reworks to give it that same cinematic sense of reach.",

      "about": "In December of 2015, Thomas Havales invited me to program a playlist of my work for his \"Guests From Chaos\" podcast. The selected artist would curate a two hour playlist of their work, plus a few artists they considered influences. I took this as a really unique opportunity to comb through what was already a pretty exhaustive personal discography and highlight some of what I felt was my strongest work up to that point. I wanted to make my playlist something special, so I mixed the pieces down into a seamless chunk of music, moving from HNW (which is what i was know for then through Altar Of Waste) through my ambient and drone work. I still feel the pieces selected represent me well, and I love the mix. It wasn't that long ago, but my work doesn't really sound like this anymore, and sometimes I miss that. I was finding my voice back then. I was much less self-critical. Sometimes that was bad and indulgent (an adjective that could be fairly levied against me even today), but sometimes it was good. Some of the ambient stuff here is some of the best I've ever made. I always wanted it to be pretty, and sad, and somehow maybe transcendent. I only included one \"influential\" work in the mix - Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind's theme for \"The Shining.\" Those who know my work will know why.\n\nI never heard any feedback about the show afterwards. I don't know if anyone listened, or cared. But i still like it very much.\n\nDue to length I had to split the podcast into two pieces, but I've done my best to retain its \"flow.\"\n\nHere's the complete tracklist (everything segues):\n\n\n\n- Cory Strand – Main Title (Terminator 2: A Reinterpretation CDR/Occult Supremacy Productions/2014)\n\n- Cory Strand – Cataclysm (excerpt) (High Off My Love: The Collection 8CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2015)\n\n- Cory Strand – Dream Attack (A Nightmare On Elm Street: A Reinterpretation 2CDR/Occult Supremacy Productions/2013)\n\n- Cory Strand – Halleluwah (excerpt) (The Bling Ring: A Reinterpretation 6CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2014)\n\n- Cory Strand – Starlight Glimmers, Dreams Wither Away (excerpt) (Three Pieces For Lindsay CDR/Occult Supremacy Productions/2013)\n\n- Cory Strand – This Life Is Not What I Imagined It To Be (excerpt) (Three Pieces For Lindsay CDR/Occult Supremacy Productions/2013)\n\n- Cory Strand – Fargo, North Dakota (excerpt) (Fargo: A Reinterpretation 5CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2014)\n\n- Cory Strand – Bemidji, MN (excerpt) (Fargo: Revisited 10CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2014) \n\n- Cory Strand – The Bison (excerpt) (To The Wonder: A Reinterpretation 5CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2013)\n\n- Cory Strand – Polish Poem (excerpt) (Inland Empire: A Reinterpretation 4CDR/Altar Of Waste Records Private Release/2013)\n\n- Cory Strand – Good Time (Lovely and Inane Remix) (excerpt) (Paris, Do You Speak French? 4CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2014)\n\n- Cory Strand – Frostbite/Cold and Dead (excerpt) (Nar/Cory Strand Split 4CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2014)\n\n- Cory Strand – Escape From New York Main Title/Engulfed Cathedral (excerpt) (Unreleased/2013)\n\n- Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind – The Shining Main Title (The Shining OST LP/Warner Brothers Records/1980)\n\n- Cory Strand – Main Title (excerpt) (The Shining: A Reinterpretation CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2012)\n\n- Cory Strand – Hermione (excerpt) (Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: A Reinterpretation 20CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2013)\n\n- Cory Strand – And They Always Come Willingly (excerpt) (The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo: A Reinterpretation 20CDR/Altar Of Waste Records/2015)\n\n- Cory Strand – Mr. Anderson Thinks That Everything Inside of Him is Worthless and Embarrassing (excerpt) (Dead Poets Society: A Reinterpretation 2CDR/No Label/2014)\n\n- Cory Strand – Please, Please Love Me (Ten or Fifteen Times cassette /Altar Of Waste Records Private Release/2013)",

No one was interested in this set when it was released, and I never sold a single copy (understandable, given its expense); I made a copy for a friend and that's the only physical that exists. These recordings were made during a shitty time in my life and I was throwing myself into work to try and get through it. Originally released in 2016 as a 27CD + DVD-R box set.\n\nIt's fair to say that \"Boogie Nights\" is one of my favorite films of all time, and one of the films that inspired me to go to film school and study the medium academically.",

A reconstruction/deconstruction of the soundtrack for Sofia Coppola's film \"The Bling Ring.\" Sofia's one of my faves in film, a brilliant director, and she knows how to put together an impeccable soundtrack. This release was one of the first collaborations between myself and my partner. It was released as a super-limited/lavish 6CD + bonus CD box set back in 2013, with a bunch of original art prints and extras. From the early days of AOW, when running the label didn't feel like perpetually drowning. This is where I first started experimenting with drums and HNW, which laid the groundwork for Fantome de Sang. Also worked with a lot of hip-hop material here, which was new for me. I love this one. Enjoy.",

Vastly different working methods from where I'm at today today. I wanted it to have a fast and dirty/visceral sort of feel (as much as drone can be visceral). A rework of Carpenter's classic minimalist synth score. A white hot night of DRONE!",

      "about": "An exhaustive study in source material. Each piece is sourced from a different live recording of Neil Young performing Bob Dylan's timeless \"All Along The Watchtower,\" from 1992 - 2008. Backing bands include Crazy Horse, the E Street Band, and Booker T. and the MG's. Different groupings performing the same material, directed under the same visionary.\n\nMy transformative process for each track was the same. All sonic differences are the results of varying recording/bootleg quality and the individual nature of each performance, based on Neil's synergy with his co-performers and the ineffable quality of \"the moment.\"\n\nI could have edited the tracks in a more ambiguous manner, cutting off obvious starts and ends and creating more opaque swathes of sound, but there's no point in obscuring what the song is. I could have provided attribution regarding each performance. I don't really want to. It seems unnecessary to me in regards to the higher aim of the collection. This is a study in specificity. You can hear each piece build and fold in on itself, a reflection of each performance as an isolated and unrepeatable instance in time/era. Does it really matter when that time/era is? \n\nThis sort of recycling has been endlessly fascinating to me; there's reference to it in my chosen artwork for this release, in that those familiar with my work (ha!) will note that I've used the cover image (from Neil's \"Journey Through The Past\" score) prior. I hope there's some sort of beauty and wonder in all of this pastiche and reinterpretation; please get lost in it. The wind begins to howl.",

      "about": "Another set of extremely long-from recordings crafted out of elements from and related to Paul Schrader's superb film \"Auto Focus,\" about the life and bizarre death of actor Bob Crane. One of my favorites and a deeply underrated film. Definitely one to check out if you've not seen it.\n\nThis was originally released as a fairly lavish box set through Altar Of Waste Records in 2014; each piece was again issued on DVD-R data discs due to the length. I've necessarily split each suite up into smaller sections for digital release.\n\nI've given each track here it's own image as well, pulled from the film.\n\nTotal runtime: 26 hrs, 45 min.\n\nHere's my original write-up of the box set, from 2014:\n\n\n\n\"Massive box set compiling an enormous amount of manipulation work sourced from Paul Schrader's 2002 film \"Auto Focus.\" Based on Robert Graysmith's book, \"Auto Focus\" tells the story of all-around nice guy actor Bob Crane (of \"Hogan's Heroes\" fame) and his extremely rampant sex drive. Schrader's film is phenomenal, a beautifully shot descent into pure and unadulterated enjoyment, a portrait of one man's struggle to reconcile his unhinged private life with his innocuous public persona.\n\n\"Auto Focus: Complete\" features six discs of very long-form HNW and ambient pieces crafted from the audio track of the film as well from various audio ephemera associated with the film and Bob Crane. The ambient works here are easily some of the most beautifully empty and ghostly pieces i've made, taken to exhaustive lengths to fully immerse you in the ether. The HNW works follow the pattern of \"(Totality)\" recordings that I've been doing lately with other films, taking giant swathes of audio and manipulating them into super textured, constantly mutating psychedelic wipeouts. \"Auto Focus: Complete\" is nearly 30 hours in its total run time-there is an immense amount of material to lose yourself in! I am incredibly proud of this one-it took an enormous amount of time and effort to create, and I think the results are well worth it. Anyone into my recent manipulations will not be disappointed!\"\n\n\n\n\"It's Fuck Time,\" The Murder of Bob Crane,\" and \"Auto Focus (Totality)\" are manipulations of the film's entire audio track.\n\n\"I Thought You Liked It\" is sourced from Angelo Badalamenti's score for the film.\n\n\"Don't Make Waves\" is sourced from Bobby Goldboro's song \"These Are the Best Times\" off of the \"Superdad\" soundtrack, one of Bob Crane's post-\"Hogan's Heroes\" film roles, which has a deep metaphorical aspect in Schrader's film.\n\n\"Jouissance\" is sourced from the \"Hogan's Heroes\" theme.\n\n\n\nThis is one of my best, most intense works. It is truly sound as total exhaustive wipeout. March towards death.\n\n\n\n-Cory Strand, January 2020",

      "about": "This compilation collects all the HNW and drone/ambient work I created dealing with Ted Bundy. I've been fascinated by criminology since I was in my teens, it was my first major in college, and like so many others starting in the HNW world, I used that interest as subject matter. Bundy continues to be a disturbingly fascinating figure to me.\n\nAll of these recordings were issued under my old moniker Lethe; for this collection I've chosen to release them under my own name. All of this material has been previously released, through Altar Of Waste Records and Occult Supremacy Productions.\n\nI've given each track a specific image as well; just choose each track proper to view.\n\n\n\nTracks 1-4: Originally released as \"Theodore Robert Bundy\" via Altar Of Waste Records in 2013.\n\nThis was the very first Altar Of Waste release (AOW 001)!\n\nI had been dabbling with HNW since 2011, and had released a few things digitally as well as on a cassette compilation issued through Worthless Recordings, but these tracks comprised my first major physical release.\n\nAll of the walls here are crude, overly aggressive, caustic, dirty, sludged out, and not especially complex or nuanced in any way. It's very primitive stuff, an artist finding their footing. The last track, \"Memories Of Necrophilia,\" points more towards the direction my work would take over the years.\n\nThe source material for all of these four pieces was guitar, played by me. I always took it as a point of pride that reviewers thought my walls sounded akin to Sunn 0))) and Earth, that the guitars were discernible in the walls. I'm a guitarist before anything else, so I'm glad that's always come through in my work.\n\n\n\nTracks 5-6: Originally released as \"Confessions 1989, Volume One\" via Occult Supremacy Productions in 2013.\n\nWorking with OSP was great as Dustin was always incredibly encouraging. I felt he really wanted me to do what I wanted to do and explore the sounds I wanted to pursue, regardless of whether they were walls or drones.\n\nThe source material for these pieces were Bundy's taped confessions to Robert Keppel and William Hagmeier, detailing the abduction and murder of Georgeann Hawkins.\n\n\n\nTracks 7-8: Originally released as \"Confessions 1989, Volume Two\" via Occult Supremacy Productions in 2014.\n\nDeep drone material.\n\nThe source materials for these pieces were again Bundy's confession tapes to Keppel and Hagmeier, this time detailing the abduction, murder, and disposal of Donna Gail Manson.\n\n\n\nTracks 9-16: Originally released as \"The Stranger\" via Altar Of Waste Records in 2014.\n\nThis set consisted of extremely long-form recordings, both HNW and ambient/drone material. It was meant to be punishing and exhaustive, and very hollowed out.\n\nThe tracks were so long that the recordings were released on DVD-R data discs (not uncommon for me at the time; I was very into creating severely long and demanding pieces.)\n\nI don't recall the source material used for this album. Lost to the ages. Some of it sounds like guitars (\"Bundy Revisited I and II\") but I can't specifically remember.\n\n\n\nI don't offer these tracks here as some sort of revelation or anything; they're just early work i did, when I was starting down this path. I still like these albums quite a bit; I think a lot of us in the HNW world have a tendency to cringe over some of our earlier wall work, but I'm not embarrassed by these recordings at all. Quite the opposite. This is where it all started for me: these walls, this set, this subject matter. They're valuable to me as archival material; it's fun to see where I began as an artist and designer. It's also humbling to remember that I can always learn more, can always refine my process and my craft, can always push further. Just keep going.\n\n\n\n-Cory Strand, January 2020",

      "about": "One of the projects I always hoped that Altar Of Waste would be associated with.\n\nWorking with the idea of David Lynch was one of my initial, and strongest, inspirations as an HNW and drone composer; my work has always been as deeply influenced by him as much as by Eliane Radigue. And he has long been one of my very favorite filmmakers.\n\n\n\nThe \"Blue Velvet\" series was an open-door compilation, designed as a platform for both established HNW acts and newcomers to the scene.\n\nAs long as an artist was a true fan of the film and could do quality work specific to and inspired by it, they could contribute an album to the series.\n\nThe initial volumes were specifically curated; each artist was selected by me and given a track from Angelo Badalamenti's score to work with.\n\nThe results were inspiring; every artist gave it their all.\n\nI quickly realized that this project could be an ongoing one, given the film's, and the label's, reach.\n\nThe final volume of the series was turned in in 2016.\n\nI am very proud of this series; it truly captured what Altar Of Waste was about.\n\nThis series, and my label, was about a love for cinema, a love for extreme music of all genres, and an unbridled creativity unfettered by genre constraints or expectations.\n\n\n\nI despise the notion of what HNW \"should\" be and I wholly reject any attempt to define it. Nothingness transcends boundary, and gatekeeping is the lowest form of criticism. It is pathetic and insecure. Altar Of Waste was always meant as a \"fuck you\" to expectation, convention, and definition.\n\nI still live by that.\n\nI hate scenes, i hate cliques, and i hate those who work to establish and perpetuate them. I hate those who take no stand in favor of some sort of pointless \"collectiveness.\" I hate the idea of the \"HNW fam.\" It is completely illusory. It's all bullshit, and it sickens me.\n\nI hate those who have done nothing, given nothing, and expect everything. That's all I ever encountered anymore in the last two years of AOW's existence. \n\nI hate ego and I hate the sense of self-congratulatory circle-jerking that typifies today's HNW world.\n\n\n\nThis series was a joy to work on - digging through the interwebs and sourcing all sorts of images and posters for the film from around the world. No one image or design could really define the film...for this digital release i've chosen one that seems to convey a sort of sense of \"expanse,\" but by no means or measure is it a summary or an encapsulation. The film is so much larger than that; I offer only an approximation, based on my own reading and enjoyment (for me, a sense of mystery, \"unknowableness,\" and sadness.) Which is what the series ultimately was for all the artists involved (I hope.)\n\nIt is my privilege to offer this series in its entirety now.\n\nTake it for free - it is my gift to you.\n\nFor this digital release, I have added a Eugene Critchley track (completed in 2020.)\n\nAlso, just for the record, I contributed a few pieces to this compilation under various projects: the Cory Strand, Lethe, and Dejection tracks are all my work.\n\nCurated by me, 2013 - 2016.\n\n\n\n-Cory Strand, January 2020",

Those tracks were then given the HNW treatment by Mitchell.\n\nSuper deluxe, very limited edition, self-released 34-disc set (containing both my ambient source tracks and the collaborative HNW tracks) in the works.

      "about": "These pieces were originally completed in 2014 as base ambient tracks for a collaborative album with Wet Dream Asphyxiation. That collab never happened, sadly, but I released these tracks a few years later as the \"bonus album\" included with my subscription series, \"A Year Of Carpenter.\"\n\nThese compositions are pulled from all of JC's scoring work; some of them I had done previous, on my own Carpenter reworks, some were drawn from films I hadn't yet worked with. The tracks that I had worked with previously were done again from the start, with new manipulations and techniques to differentiate them from my original versions.\n\nWhen i grabbed these files a few nights ago i noticed that two tracks were lost, \"Assault On Precinct 13\" and \"Main Title/Engulfed Cathedral.\" In an effort to provide as complete a restructuring of the original album as possible, I have gone back and remade new versions of these tracks, adhering as closely as i could (remember) to my working methods/techniques from several years ago. I think i came pretty close.\n\n1. From \"Assault On Precinct 13\"\n\n2. From \"The Fog\"\n\n3. From \"Escape From New York\"\n\n4. From \"The Fog\"\n\n5. From \"Halloween\" and \"Halloween II\"\n\n6. From \"They Live\"\n\n7. From \"Christine\"\n\n8. From \"Dark Star\"\n\n9. From \"Prince Of Darkness\"\n\n10. From \"Halloween III\"\n\n11. From \"They Live\"\n\n12. From \"Escape From L.A.\"\n\n13. From \"They Live\"\n\n14. From \"Vampires\"",

Your pain is not greater than anyone else's, nor does it make the \"art\" you produce any less vacant. Everything you've done has been done before, and better. Your work will be forgotten, as will every \"live performance\" you've ever done. All that will be left is the black hole of hurt that you constantly demand everyone around you acknowledge.\n\nA spotlight is not an illumination. A platform is not transcendence.\n\nI hate your scene, and I hate your projects.\n\nI am not a part of it.\n\nI refuse, and I deny.\n\nDeath to false noise.\n\nFUCK OFF AND DIE.",

      "about": "This was our second show. We were invited to play by our friends in the Amish Armada, and since it was at 7th. Street Entry (one of the best venues in Minneapolis) we jumped at the chance. I know I was really nervous and it shows in my behaviour at the show. There's a reason why I've since stopped chatting with an audience. Ben's much better suited for it and much funnier. We were really playing the songs slow at this point and they were aways from sounding their best, but this is still a milestone show for a few reasons. I had just bought my Fender Jaguar (still my main guitar) and was astonished at how awesome it sounded, although i really shot myself in the foot by using a Boss Hyperfuzz as my distortion on this one (yuck! what the fuck was I thinking?) Favorite quote from this show: Ben saying \"It's all good, boys\" before we ripped into \"Youth of America.\" We later pressed this show up in a small edition-Matt created the artwork and handpainted the CDs. Sometimes I still see a copy turn up used in a Cheapo and it makes a little sad.\n\nFun fact: \"Adrift in the Stars\" was the first of our many domain names.",

      "about": "(Ben) This show was one of the first we booked by just walking in to the place and making contact with a guy. The month before we played, I went to Bon Apetit to see a show and a band called Harkonen played. After the gig I walked up to one of the guys in the band and said \"you guys are great! we should play a show together sometime!\" \"Dude, we're from Seattle,\" came the reply. I felt pretty dumb. \n\nAnyway... we asked our friends The Knotwells to open the show. It was their first show ever! They went on to be much more popular than we could hope to be. \n\n\n\n(Cory) My recollections of this are pretty vague. I do recall that my pedal rig for this show consisted of 17 pedals. Fucking ridiculous. I probably used about five of them, but I was trying to sell myself as some sort of effects wizard back then and really wanted visual effect. A weird set list, too. I'm not really sure what we were going for other than just leveling the audience. This show was in a very small space and was insanely loud. We used full stacks...\n\nThe pointless chatter caught on tape towards the end of the set are the inane mutterings of an associate of ours long since dispelled from our lives. His name was Taylor, and he was one of the most arrogant people I've ever met. I have no idea who he's talking to at this show. It was more than likely any breathing female within arm's length. I remember taking Taylor to a Mudhoney show with me once and being disgusted watching him make out with some random chick from First Ave during the encore. Part of me would like to make a documentary about him, because he's a weird, grossly fascinating presence. But that would mean getting in touch with him again. I'm not ready to go there.\n\nI recall that Tool were playing a show this same night, and we somehow thought that was affecting out local draw. Jesus.",

      "about": "This volume of the collection gathers all of the available b-sides and outtakes we could muster together. Most of the material was recorded during the \"Threnodic\" session, but there are a few other recordings included. As a band we tried to choose our covers pretty carefully: Matt and I both had backgrounds in punk and metal, and all three of us were Nirvana devotees, plus we all thought it pretty neat for a band so inclined towards \"pretty\" music to shred it up thrash style. At one point, Ben and I were tossing around the idea of a cover album of classic hardcore punk songs, but it never happened. I think we would have been pretty adept at it. There were a couple other covers we did that we regrettably don't have recordings of: for a while we were doing a massive cover of the Cure's \"Plainsong\" (which Matt hated playing as it sounded too much like our own material), Marvin Gaye's \"Sexual Healing\" (which Ben always rocked the vocal on), and at one show we did an improv-heavy riff on 5ive's \"Bicycle Racer.\" All of those are lost to the ages. This stuff is what's left.",
