      "about": "Two legends, together again. Teenage Fanclub’s Norman Blake and Half Japanese’s Jad Fair have teamed up to bring you their new magnum opus, “Yes”. Encompassing all the songwriting eccentricities that have made these guys famous, this new collaborative album also features some of the most genteel, engagingly catchy, and downright adorable music in recent memory.\n\n\n\nNorman Blake and Jad Fair originally collaborated over a decade ago on the Teenage Fanclub and Jad Fair album “Words of Wisdom and Hope” (Domino/Alternative Tentacles). Unlike the simple, aggressive style of Half Japanese, the 13 new tracks on “Yes” feature refined, guitar­-laden power-­pop and saccharine ­sweet melodies, accompanied by backup singers and layered horn arrangements.\n\n\n\nFair’s characteristically­ manic vocal style is still present, but when coupled with the head­-bopping, articulately ­layered arrangements of Norman Blake, the result is a potently earnest album that is brimming with positivity.",

      "about": "In 1974 Jad and David Fair teamed up to form a band called Half Japanese. The route was simple, at ﬁrst. If one pounded on drums the other could squeeze sounds from an electric guitar. There were no other band members to stay in tune with, so there was no particular reason for them to worry about tuning the guitar in a traditional manner or learning traditional chords. They were free from the start to express their music in their own way. They traded off the guitar and drumming rolls. Whichever one sang the words also played the guitar and the other one drummed. For a couple of years they wrote, recorded and performed this way, without the convention of more members. When they did decide to expand they went big. They ﬁrst thought of recruiting an outside drummer, so that both could play guitars at the same time.\n\n\n\nIn 2014 Jad and David stripped things back to the roots. They went back to recording as a duo. One sang and played guitar, the other one drummed. 40 years had passed, but they slipped right back into the original roles and churned out a number of breath-stealing songs. 40 years later; 40 years better. One pick, two sticks and heart-warming vocals... That’s all they needed; two brothers, still rockin’ the same damn deal!",
