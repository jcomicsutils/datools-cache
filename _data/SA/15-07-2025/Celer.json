      "about": "It was shortly a half-hour before dawn when we entered the passageways. Covering a space of about 32,000 meters, the walls were solid marble, and stood at least 12 meters high, set along the outside walls, and then as thin “hallways” all leading toward the final chamber. These hallways, because of the placement adjacent to the mountainsides, seemed to channel the wind from the north, giving nearly every sound inside the walls a thick echo, and this sound - mixed with the sand and stone shuffling, created a thin overlaying sound, somewhat reminiscent of rustling leaves.\n\n\n\nAs the sun rose, we had reached the entrance of the chamber, an open door adorned with incised devotional plaques carved from copper, all representing the cardinal points on a compass. The chamber itself seemed as if to be strutted with miniature ziggurats piled on top of each other, forming a point at the center of the room. I had assumed this was a temple, but as I moved into the room with my group, their flashlights slowly turning off as the sun rose, we began to notice something new.\n\n\n\nThe sound of the place continued. The echoes of footsteps, or tools through the passageways came into the chamber as well. Yet, from the open ceiling, over the far wall opposite the pinnacle, we could hear the sound of our two generators churning. Slow, repetitive revolutions, soft machinic whispers, and mixing with the sound from behind. It was then I realized that at that time, instead of the sound of generators, we would instead be hearing the sound of choral voices, and they would therefore be mixing with whatever sounds would also come from the passageways - which were actually not passageways at all, but different stages on the climb to the pinnacle. As we climbed, the sounds became louder, and finally reaching the top of the pinnacle - where there was no space for more than one man, was a clear view of the sun directly ahead.\n\n\n\nWhat purpose this sequence of things are, I cannot say. Yet, I’ve been unable to stop thinking that it all has some connection with my own experience, and the loss of my sight from that very moment upon witnessing the sun.",

      "about": "Originally recorded and released in digital format only in 2021, There Were More Failures Than This is a set of ensemble pieces made with tape loops and analog instruments. Related to its companion album It Would Be Giving Up, this set pushes yet again into the reaches of oblivion, utilizing a wall-of-sound approach to world building, and imagining alternate realities. Meanwhile, the fires continue to burn, even if from afar. At the least, it is an example of a conjuring of a myriad of memory, false and real, remembered and forgotten, left along the wayside or riding along that dusty highway to nowhere.\n\n\n\nPacked in a custom-designed clamshell box, of 4 discs with individual pocket sleeves, and a 20-page booklet. Remastered from the original tapes by Stephan Mathieu at Schwebung.",

      "about": "Field Records takes a look into the vast catalogue of Celer, the prolific ambient project from Tokyo-based American artist Will Long. Perfectly Beneath Us was originally released in 2012 as a CD-R on Still*Sleep, and now it’s being presented as a vinyl release, remastered by Stephan Mathieu.\n\n\n\nCeler began in California in 2005 as a collaborative project between Will Long and Danielle Baquet, resulting in reams of self-released work up until Baquet passed away in 2009. Long opted to keep their project going, and Celer has continued to grow as an expansive exploration of purest ambient. With such a sizeable library of sounds to explore, the reissue of Perfectly Beneath Us serves as an ideal entry point into the middle period of Celer's catalogue, presenting four pieces of sustaining, lethargic movements, wreaked in profound subtlety. \n\n\n\nThis captivating piece of work rewards the attentive listener as much as it soothes the casual drifter. Now beautifully framed on a carefully considered reissue, this record fits neatly with the label's own repertoire of evocative, subliminal electronics.",

      "about": "From Will Long\n\n\n\nIt was months ago, but it could have been weeks, days, or even hours since then. I stopped wanting to hear loops, I wanted to stop it. I added brass; trumpets, trombones, and more horns. I cut it out like words from a book, and sewed it back together. Burroughs. These movements are merely to stay alive, to stay moving. \n\n\n\nYou wake up from a truck horn passing in the early morning hours on the nearby freeway, or from a dream that you can't tell was a nightmare or a loving memory. \n\n\n\nSomeone walks by on the street wearing the same perfume. I drew out each place, each scene, and put the story there. It might have been with you, or without you. All I know is that you were there somehow the whole time, even if you weren't.\n\n\n\nI saw rainbows from under the bridge by the river, and the sun shot up through the clouds of the golden hour. It didn't help, and there was no one around. Your chest is even with your knees, and you're sitting in the dirt. The sun keeps going down, and eventually you make your way home. It's not very much the same as it was anymore. The horns are deafening, but after, the echoes let me see the way away.\n\n\n\nThe light keeps coming, and it keeps going. Songs of surroundings, the silent, the heartbeats, the tears. We've all had them, and we'll never be rid of them.",

      "about": "Being Below is a mini-album of short songs created with digital and analogue instruments, recorded in 2020. Written with a structure that reflects shifting states, overlooking the past and future as a split pathway with the present endlessly fluctuating between. The pangs of rumination. An exercise in loop-less writing.\n\n\n\nMastered by Stephan Mathieu at Schwebung, and designed by Rutger Zuydervelt.\n\n\n\nPressed in a limited edition of 150 crystal clear 12\" vinyl, 150 black 12\" vinyl in a reverse-board sleeve as a dual release from Past Inside the Present and Two Acorns. A CD edition in a reverse-board 4-panel package with glass-mastered CD is also available from Two Acorns. \n\n\n\n\n\nAfterword:   \n\nStaring out, tense. Looking down isn’t so different than looking up, but it passes by faster. Contentment at the accomplishment that I'm here, and the fear that what I’ve always been looking for has passed by. Staring up and looking at the sky, wishing you were up here with me, here where you can see everything. Above, the surface drifts by, and the colors on the horizon in pale blues makes me calm. Then blue. Deep in pale blue. \n\n\n\nAgain, in the morning. Close your eyes. Repeating this, repeating that, then it changes. Try to stay focused, but you've already moved out of sight. You're a million miles away, and farther. Waiting for night. Stars, always beyond. Now, it's already tomorrow.",

However, after months - almost 1.5 years now, the longer I stare at them on my daily walks through the bolsons, the bubbles seem to turn it into a more burnt orange (3).\n\n\n\nIn addition, my lungs feel increasingly burned, from nightly chainsmoking (4). I’ve been able to reduce my intake of wine (white wine no longer makes me nauseous) to one bottle per week (5). Usually this is after what should be the most stable day of communication with family and/or friends - of which I’m allotted one day per week, as their schedules allow (6).\n\n\n\nIn addition, there are nightmares. Reconciliation fantasies (7), or alternate realities of which are the most absurd, with shifting centuries (8).\n\n\n\nLastly, there is the view from waist level, and up, in kaleidoscopic form (9). Everyday is the same. This projected sunlight, symmetrical patterns, tilted surfaces - by now it should be obvious why each direction is the same - it is all simultaneous (10). I’m starting to feel this way as well - I think that is the effect of this place (11). You heard this before, and have seen this before. I’ll leave you with this - stop expecting something to change - because it already happened, you just were looking for the wrong kind of change (12).\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long.

Following a similar trajectory as that of Memory Repetitions and Future Predictions, this set pushes further beyond, continuing to utilize a wall-of-sound approach to mood construction, and reflections on complicated grief. Simultaneously, it is a further statement to intensify blurring of the lines between genres, with sound palettes defined solely by their chosen volume. Finally, it should exist as a pure manifestation of uncertainty, fate, and illusion. \n\n\n\nPacked in a custom-designed clamshell box, of 4 discs with individual pocket sleeves, and a 20-page booklet. Remastered from the original tapes by Stephan Mathieu at Schwebung.",

      "about": "From Will Long\n\n\n\nIt is scarcely a month since I landed, and time has felt like it hasn't moved in ages. The voyage across the ocean was a trial, with sweeping white waves amid a grey expanse where nothing moved but my stomach, which felt perpetually inverted, as I lay bent like an angel over the side of the boat, gazing eyelessly into a blank abyss. Rats infested most of the lower portions after the first week, and I thought we'd all be eaten or either starved by the time we arrived. I expected something much more glorious when I arrived, a grandeur of lights and smiles, ticker tape parades and famous faces waving from the windows. But the reality blended into something more amorphous, with blank faces blackened by work in dank factories, smokestacks spilling a black spume into the sky, and lights and night that crackled with gunshots as if firecrackers were constantly lit off. It would seem like a celebration, save for the screams of agony and and cries of woe from the alleyways. \n\n\n\nNow I sit where I imagined a parade of summer vacationers, near a beach next to the largest city, a pleasure palace, a circus and fair for all kinds, with a boardwalk that seems to be opening up to the sky. What I imagined, turns out to be completely silent, save for a few drunken blabberings from the amidst the heaps of rubbish blown into corners. The beach has turned into an amalgamation of ground seashells, and the waves come across with crushing sweeps that bring tears of dry windburn to my eyes. It's rarely what I wished, but it's all that's left, here in the last place called Paradise.",

It has been mastered by Stephan Mathieu at Schwebung, and designed by Rutger Zuydervelt. \n\n\n\nLimited edition, custom-made clamshell box, 4xCDs in pocket sleeves, and 16-page booklet.

      "about": "From Will Long:\n\n\n\n“My first encounter was 5 years ago, at Isle Royale. At a certain depth, we had found masses - thick, large sheets of copper weighing up to many tons, set inside “rooms” deep in the vertical shafts, and which typically could be taken away in chunks, or as a whole. We used black powder to loosen the ore, and hoist it up to the surface in wooden buckets. There were at least 5 of us at the base of the shaft, or along the lower winzes.”\n\n\n\n“And where did you first encounter this “phenomenon”, as you call it?”\n\n\n\n“It was at Nacimiento, on the 3rd day of our excavation. We had just found a large mass in a large room that resembled a rotunda, and there were 3 of us in the room, after the others had ascended with the opening load, which had been at the “doorway” to the room, as we later discovered. What lay inside covered the entire southern wall, roughly 20 feet wide, and 35 feet high. When we entered the room, our candles made the walls glow, brilliant like sunlight. Immediately we began work, as it seemed to be one entire sheet against the far southern wall. We planned to break it into vertical pieces, chipping away at the sides to pry it from the wall, as we had done previously when we encountered it at earlier depths.\n\n\n\nBut on the 3rd hit with the pike, the entire wall face shattered, almost as if it turned instantly to ash, and disintegrated at our feet, though with hardly anything left but a cold blast of wind, and a cloud of almost-vaporous mist covering the room, which dissipated quickly, and completely, in about 2 minutes. With the crash, all of our candles had gone out. We called to each other, and gathered near the doorway, and relit our candles. At that very instant, the entire room lit up, upon hitting the light, in an blinding deep blue light, but upon further examination, consisting of hexagonal crystals, blocky, crudely formed mosaics, sparkling from light in every direction, completely covering the wall behind where the copper wall had stood moments before.\n\n\n\nIn addition, I felt an instantaneous change in my physical being. I would say that suddenly, despite the altitude, I could breathe so clearly, I felt no pain anywhere in my body, and any hint of fear, regret - whether past or present - was existent. Everything completely disappeared, and I was left in a nearly perfect state of being. I felt acceptance of everything, and protection, as if by the stars themselves.”\n\n\n\n“Any what happened when you extracted the ore?”\n\n\n\n“It disintegrated with a change in depth, and the color completely vanished upon exposure to sunlight. The feeling, whether related or not, also never returned. But I still remember the color. The Madonna’s mantle in Raphael's Madonna and Child Enthroned with Saints, is the closest I have seen. And since that day, I stare at a reproduction of this painting for hours, unwilling to break eye contact, and attempt to experience that feeling again.”",

      "about": "Phonetic script: Xièxie \n\nChinese characters: 谢谢\n\n谢谢 ( xiexie / xièxie ) is composed of these characters: 谢 (xie) , 谢 (xie)\n\nEnglish translation: thank you, thanks\n\nto say  |  to thank  |  literally means 'thanks'. 'Thank you' in Chinese would be xièxie nĭ (if you thank an individual), or xièxie nĭmen (to say thank you to a group of people).\n\n\n\n- Chinese -> English Dictionary\n\n\n\n\n\nA week before leaving, I bought a dictionary and phrasebook.\n\n\n\nCovered in rain, during the days and even the nights, Shanghai was lit in a glow, a mist turning to a constant grey fog. Buildings lined with neon and lcd screens flashed, and from around corners and behind buildings, the night was illuminated much the same as the day. Cars separated the classes, their horns voices punctuating the streets, as pedestrians in groups loosely scattered the streets, talking and walking on speakerphone.\n\n\n\nStanding by the metro escalators, there in the square with the overhanging trees of a park, there is construction all around. The buildings seem to be climbing into the darkness at this very moment. Leaving behind and moving forward. We seem to know everything already, our illusion of experience. I imagine taking your hand, I imagined taking your hand, and the lights in the subway flicker as we go deeper. Transit bookmarks each experience, every daydream, and in the end they're interchangeable and indistinguishable between reality and imagination. Try to remember which is real.\n\n\n\nTo Hangzhou the maglev reached 303 km/h, the towering apartment buildings hunch under construction, passing by in blurs on the flat farmland landscape. I fell asleep, as you were dancing but to no music. The lilies on the lake nodded in the rain, dipping into the water. There was a Wal-Mart near the hotel where I won a pink bunny from a claw machine. I remember the beauty of the architecture of Hangzhou station, birds swirling around the pillars near the top, the echoes of the deep station interior, and the laughing at being lost. There at least we have each other, that memory, or that daydream.\n\n\n\nEverything moves faster than we can control. Days are just flashes, moments are mixed up but burned on film, and all of the places and times are out of order. If it could only be us, only ours. If it was ours, if it was us. Sometimes everything goes faster than you can control and you can't stop, much less understand where you are. I bought a dictionary and phrasebook, but \"xièxie\" was the only word I ever got to use. \n\n\n\n- Will Long, January 2019\n\n\n\n\n\n在出行前一個星期, 我買了中文字典和中文片語集。\n\n\n\n上海到處都是下雨，不論白天還至是夜晚，雨在持續不斷的灰霧之下閃閃發光。我們參觀了外灘，關於未來的一切就像這種灰霧一樣渾濁。「現在抱緊我。」她說。抑或, 是我說過的話嗎？ 汽車的喇叭聲是刺穿街道的聲音；而每當我們經過茶飲店時，我們停下來。\n\n\n\n站在這裡的地鐵自動扶梯，或站在被公園包圍的廣場，現在它們看起來歷久常新。 我喜歡那些古舊，但我亦對嶄新的抱感興趣。 像我這樣的人都認為自己已經知道那些虛幻的經驗。 我無法理解，我無法理解自己。 我們看似不同，但我們將始終如一。 我現在想像牽著你的手，也曾想像過我牽著你的手。隨著我們走得越來越深入, 地鐵裡的燈光就閃爍不斷 。如果這些景象只能跟內裡的洞穴感配搭起來，那我就知道它不能持久，它是不能持久，是不能持久...\n\n\n\n抽煙的男人們在街上跟我們擦身而過，而我拍了幾張一包包香煙散留於地上的照片。 這就好像我們到處尋找一家沒有服務員將頭倒在桌面上睡覺的餐廳。 我們只是在下雨的城市漫步迷失，還是只是在性愛當中感到茫然？ 樹木低垂在湖面上，它們在雨中哭泣。 但是我仍然可以在臉上感覺到雨中的薄霧，感覺到我們在雨傘外面手牽手，雙手依然保持濕潤。 所有這些瞬間中，即使你不在我身邊，但你常在我的腦海之中。 究竟, 幻像與現實之間的區別在哪裡？\n\n\n\n杭州的磁懸浮列車的時速達到每小時303公里，它經過閃亮潮濕的跨省公路和高樓，在平坦的農田景觀中迷糊的流淌著。 你身在遙遠之地，但你如就在我身旁。 一切都比我們所能控制的走得更快。 那些日子就像是閃爍的光，那些不同的時刻混雜在一起, 但它們最終卻烙印在菲林之上; 而我們曾經擁有的地方和時間都已經失序, 已不合時宜。 如果這些只屬於我們，那就只屬於我們。 假設它曾經是屬於我們，假設它曾經是我們。 有時候一切都比你能控制的要快，你不能停下來，更不用說你能否了解你所在之處。 \n\n\n\nWill Long 威爾 · 朗\n\nJanuary 2018 2018年1月\n\n\n\n- translation by Edwin Lo\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: If you are confused about the reason for the \"uncut\" versions, it is because when streaming from Bandcamp and some other laggy players, the website loading time between tracks will cause a skip, and the uncut version allows you to bypass that.\n\n\n\nPart 1 and Part 2 are not joined together because they are two different parts.",

      "about": "From Will Long\n\n\n\nThe sun hung over the rounded edges of the sandstone hills, glowing in yellow. The red clay bottom of the pool cast the water in a deep orange, small patches of white sage and lavender grew in clumps near the crevices, attaching themselves to the available dirt hiding beneath the sand. A subtle wind lapped against the water, reflecting the dying hues of the day. Waiting for time to pass, I leaned up from leaning on the sandy ground against a charcoal rock, squinting at the sunlight as it folded over the sleepy afternoon. There were still several weeks here, so there's time. \n\n\n\nThe sun was too high to be visible, but the sunset makes new reflections. From under the cliff, the pool, about 20 yards wide, looked almost flat against the horizon. The shore was strewn with the same soft pebbles and yellowing sand as a dried beach, and on the east end was a cave, completely hidden from the hills and open prairie above. In the shadows there below. You could imagine such a place from above, riding by, or passing on the road. \n\n\n\nFeeling the night wind start blowing in from the mountains to the west, their caps dipped in snow, and their bodies glowing in blue, there was only a sound brimming up. Climbing up, and stopping near the edge, we listen. Nothing seemed to move, only drops occasionally falling into the pool below from the natural well, starting somewhere into the blackness at the back of the cave.\n\n\n\nEventually, the sun dissipates, the red glow receded, and fell over the faces of the dusty hills as the stars began to show.",

      "about": "From Will Long\n\n\n\nThere's a smothering, a cradling, and our surroundings are suddenly dampened and echo beyond. In each direction there's nothing to be seen - or there is, a cliff, a dropoff, a ridge, a ledge, looking down into nothing. Or, there's a sudden swell, and escarpments rise with hollow, bristling whistles, ripping the bones out of our hands, muscles splitting and dripping into the bottom of the undisturbed water. \n\n\n\nWith my face plunged into the darkness, there's only the ice cold chill, and the hollow hum surrounding every empty wall. Suddenly, light seems to come from below, spinning, and flashing in a tintinnabulation of sparkling, piercing, shattering shards of iridescent crackle. Purled, out of the water and thrown into the air, the lights - as less they are described the better - shatter into thousands of rays, suck all of the sounds of our surroundings in, and explode in a moment of silence. Echos beyond, dampened suddenly, our surroundings a cradling, a smothering there.",

      "about": "Several years ago I played a show at Ftarri in Tokyo. I used a cassette player with a Lexicon MPX1 effects rack. After about 10 minutes, the cassette player began to emit loud bursts of noise whenever touched, and a low buzz, likely due to some electrical problems. After a few minutes of dropping sound and bursts of noise, I stopped it altogether.\n\n\n\nThe only other alternative for the rest of the show was the MPX one, and while mostly an effects unit, instead I used this as the instrument, using the preset \"Test Tone\" which emits a single, steady adjustable tone. Since the MPX has internal patching capabilities, I could add other effects completely internally without any input.\n\n\n\nThere was no recording made that night, but these 3 tracks are a recent revisiting of the same system, with no overdubs, in real time. It is not pretty, it is often unnerving, but so is everything sometimes.\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2020\n\n\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long, 2020.\n\n\n\nNote: Distortion is present and uncut, yet it does not exceed safe 0.0db speaker levels. However, I do not recommend playing loudly.",

An experiment with long-form tape collage loops.\n\n\n\nI thought I would go to try craft beer, even though I don't really drink, and especially not anymore, just because we always talked about doing it but only did it once or twice. I thought it might be fun, or I thought I might run into you, but it wasn't, and I didn't. I dressed very nice, and researched the best place to go in Shibuya. It was closed. Ok, where was the second most recommended place in the area? It was also closed. Here was another place across the street, I might as well try there instead of walking around for longer. I walked down the stairs, and entered the room. There were couples all over the room, arranged like socially-distanced figures on a chessboard. The host greeted me as I entered, and directed me to a table that was more like a shelf, facing the wall with my back to the entire room. I looked at it with a murky expression from under my mask, and said \"sorry, I can't sit facing the wall.\" Walking back outside, I thought \"this is stupid, I'm just going home.\"\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2020",

Am I here, and is that why you're looking away? \n\n\n\n\"All human errors are impatience, a premature breaking off of methodical procedure, an apparent fencing-in of what is apparently at issue.\" \n\n\n\nLet go. I can't let go, if it's the last thing I remember. \n\n\n\nNext to you, sitting next to me. Across from me, sitting across from me. \n\n\n\nThe transfiguration, the metamorphosis. In triples.\n\n\n\nI scribbled these notes - these melodies. For months. I meant it to be many things, but in the end I put it all together. Altogether. \n\n\n\nI'm really separated, more than before. Grew up to be an individual, and that resulted in connections to no one. \n\n\n\nHorizons. \n\n\n\nI'll arrange my photos to leave some story behind. Each one has some story. But I can't keep that one. Or that one. Write you own story, but no one sees the real story except yourself.\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2020\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long, 2020.",

      "about": "I was ready to stay, I was ready to wait. I took the bus, eyes open but as if asleep, resting on the damp headrest, watching the rivers pass by, always looking the same, one by one on the road on and on, away. I had been there before. The sister kept telling me \"you should abet your affection for the tobacco\", and she asked me why. Why this, why that. I looked for god, but I went to medicine. I tried to find trust in other men, but they just wanted a fuck. I tried to find love with women, and they just scoffed. \"You're a sweet boy, just stay true to yourself,\" the sister murmured, grey hair shining like purple in the moonlight by the window, lighting a cigarette as long as a flagpole.\n\n\n\nI walked on the beach, and at once noticed I had stopped, falling forward. The pompadour piines swung in the dimlight, the birds crowed as if they just found a new meal. I looked through a book filled with photos.. the beautiful landscapes, the sad spaces, all for me to look at with little use. Your unanswered letters, deleted emails, and lost contacts. The sun set in yellow, and the night came on with a belt. \n\n\n\nUnderneath rosewood and myrtle; it smells sour. Asleep, and then waking. It's tomorrow, and as always, I'm still here. \n\n\n\nRecorded in 2018. Full, uncut loop. A shorter, rippled tape edit was used for the compilation track \"Of a Celestial Body\". All music by Will Long.",

      "about": "Strength, ectasy, billow-ness. I've been dreaming of this moment, to sail up into the clouds. This ultimate force that pushes behind me, sitting against a rocket, soaring and feeling as if you will burst into flames at any second. That explosion is not an ending, but the beginning of a search, a place to find you, to find myself, to be lost, to lose, to find yourself nowhere, lost among the clouds. \"Stop looking out the window\", the teacher used to say. I was transfixed on the view. I'd walk along the street a decade later, books in my hand, with my chin up. Everytime I'd see the airliner flying over, I'd wish I was there, sitting on top, arms out. The wind hits you so hard it wells up tears in your eyes. Now I'm looking back, and trying the radio. I keep sending out messages, but no one replies. This world full of people, and no one is listening. \"He's always the one smiling\", they whisper and laugh. Fall back into your dreaming, and wait for tomorrow, old man.\n\n\n\nRecorded in 2020. Previously unreleased. All music by Will Long.",

The sun feels warm in the early morning, the wind nodding the grass, and rustling candy wrappers rolling with the breeze. Sailing far above everything, with your fingers reaching into the wind, the mountains look more like craters, phosphorus indentations in the earth, and the sun is with you, at your level, burning your neck. Looking down, the water swells with passing boats, in rippling iridescent rainbows. \n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded in 2018 - 2019\n\nAll music by Will Long\n\nCover photo by Dennis Cowals\n\nSpecial thanks to Patrick Spatz and Terre Thaemlitz",

Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign \"Buy Nothing Day\". These critics feel a need for \"resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms\".\" - Wikipedia",

In 2011 I decided to continue using Celer, and in 2016 I decided to use my own name for only my house music productions. These tracks are from that period in 2009-2011, some appeared on compilations, but most were never used at all. Quality varies, and many were recorded direct from tape.

      "about": "Ambient music is a difficult thing to categorize - especially your own music. It's easy to just name several easy genres, and that's it. Sometimes it's enough, but not always. If we go back to the origins according to Brian Eno, he says \"You could pay attention or you could choose not to be distracted by it if you wanted to do something while it was on\" and that ambient music is \"creating an ambience, a sense of place that complements and alters your environment.\" For myself, I always understood where Eno was coming from, and how it applies to his music, and ambient music in general. But even though this music has been an influence for me (particularly Brian Eno's Discreet Music), it wasn't always what I set out to do from the beginning. With the tools I had, it's just what my music ended up sounding like - or to say it another way, it was what I wanted to listen to myself.\n\n\n\nFor a long time I rejected Eno's idea about making my own music, because I wasn't interested in making background music. People can perceive your music any way they want it, applying it to the way they hear it and how it applies to their life and surroundings, but that doesn't always match your reasons for making it. There was always something much more interactive to me - and those memories are completely vivid to me - if they're quiet, it's because that's how they really were - but it doesn't mean they were less-strong, or shouldn't be paid attention to. Other music (more loop oriented, and direct) is all about repeating a memory, a feeling, or something else - this may not be exactly how it happened, but this is how I remember it, and by making it this way it sets it in stone. For me, at least.\n\n\n\nSoryu may be something different entirely the same. There are all these things present still - but for some reason, to me, it feels like possibly the only purely ambient music that I've ever made. I don't mean this to be background music, but by saying 'purely ambient', to me it is as close to Eno's definition as is possible (up to now). It isn't meant to be ignored, but instead it's something to be lost in - a maze where everything looks the same - there are familiar places and sounds, different colors and different sized objects, but you're lost in this place, and these things repeat, not always in the same order. It's a zone, somewhere where everything can become familiar, but it doesn't always seem to be ordered the same way. For example, in Alain Resnais' 1968 film Je t'aime, je t'aime everything is the same, but the way you memorize it feels different - what you thought was familiar is not really that at all, and after repeating it over and over, you see it or yourself differently. At least, you can.\n\n\n\nSoryu is the first in a series of long-form pieces made with this idea. The story and background for each varies, but the direction remains the same. That is, having no direction.\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long, recorded 2013 - 2015 in Japan\n\n\n\nCover photo courtesy of William A. Long, Jr.\n\n\n\nA Two Acorns release \n\nCatalog 2A07, digital only\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "'Infinite set' was created for the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOT) Tokyo in 2016. Originally planned to be a generative and interactive user-customizable piece, the music is built of 3 identical tape loops with alternating equalization set as low, mid, and high, repeating in and out of sync with a video projection of 10 seconds of a sunset repeating forwards and backwards. \n\n\n\nThis is a cut of the original screening audio in a form that can be repeated infinitely without break. The full duration is meant to play for 24 hours with sometimes slight modulations and sometimes drastic, yet always returning to original form at some points. \n\n\n\nIt is recommended to only listen for a few minutes, remember something you don't want to forget, and let it go forever.\n\n\n\nCover image is a still from the above-mentioned video projection.\n\n\n\nMusic and video by Will Long.\n\n\n\nThank you for your support.",

      "about": "On the afternoon of New Year's Eve, 2009, I went to the beach in my home of Huntington Beach, to walk my dogs. As the sun set, in the sky to the west, against the clouds and over Catalina Island appeared what looked a lot like a missle or rocket trail, shooting upwards into the sky. \n\n\n\nNews reports from the days after claimed that it was just a jet stream from an airliner going to Hawaii from Orange County airport, but if you were on the beach that day, you could see that the direction of the jet stream was almost straight up. Mysterious.. The next day, as I had already planned and had been packing the two weeks before, I moved away from California.\n\n\n\nThis loop, titled 'Catalina' is the last loop made on my Norelco Continental 400 open reel, on the same day. It had an open circuit board, which constantly shocked me, and is one reason I left it behind for the garbage. \n\n\n\nYou can read more about the rocket here:  sciencedude.ocregister.com/2009/12/31/mystery-launch-visible-off-oc/75161/\n\n\n\n Please support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "'Spumes Mistaken For Snow' was originally recorded in 2009, and was never released due to fall-through with a label, and because an accompanying track of field recordings from the interior of a house in Nepal, during a snowstorm, was completely lost due to tape decay. The full album was intended to be a complete mix of the instrumental side of the album, and the straight, untouched field recording. Because of these circumstances the album was never formally released. Now, however, I am making it available digitally, as the story provides a good memory, and beauty through imagination. \n\n\n\nThough the album may be forever incomplete, the music remains. Despite the loss of the sounds of footsteps on a creaky floor, an oven heating up, wind and snow blowing harshly outside the unsealed window, the cushion of warm blankets, or the rickety bed springs, maybe it's best left to imagination in the end anyway.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "A few summers ago it was really hot, and to take my mind off of it I started watching documentaries of Arctic expeditions, and reading diaries of people stationed alone gathering weather information in the ice worlds. Some of them talked about being attacked by polar bears, or watching the stars every night. I made these two tracks, to submit in the next spring to the Send + Receive festival for a in-room installation - the first track acting as the 'opening', placed at the doorway, and inside the second track playing from 3 room locations on random repeat, starting at different intervals.\n\n\n\nWhen spring came, the snow and cold from the winter a few months ago made me change my mind, and I never submitted the music. \n\n\n\nNote: This is not a new album but archival material that I am making available because I have no plans to release it in a physical format.

Disc 5 of the set is being re-manufactured and all orders with faulty CDs will be replaced. We apologize for this inconvenience and thank you in advance for your patience.***\n\n\n\nOperating outside the limelight in the underground, Will Long has produced prolifically across genres, monikers, and countries since 2006. Predating his minimal house contributions under his given name to DJ Sprinkles’ Comatonse label and Smalltown Supersound, Long has put forth over a hundred collections of ambient compositions in stream of consciousness fashion under the name Celer. A native to America, Long has been based in Tokyo since 2011, where he has continued to expand upon his vault of celestial arrangements, amassing a cult following over the years by releasing them on under-the-radar labels, his own Two Acorns label, and on his Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nMemory Repetitions serves to reflect on the labyrinthine body of work that comprises Celer. Spanning five pieces, each roughly thirty minutes in length, the compilation is being released as a 5-CD box set alongside its digital format via Smalltown Supersound on November 9th.",

      "about": "Side A\n\nSit down, put your arms out, and lean your head back. Your neck rests on the black leather of the couch, and warm sunlight only comes in if you open the windows. Marble angels watch over you, and the lights can stay low. While you're sleeping, I can't imagine that you're dreaming at all. I took photos of the curtains, and waited for what seemed like hours for you to wake up. I couldn't sleep at all, just sitting under the lights. I've dreamed of this moments we've had. Every interpretation is simplistic, an expectation that you can find some whole in something so thin. Even the thinnest knives can cut deeply. Dreams that love can be the solution, that I'll find everything here, no, everything there. Maybe next time everything will be perfect. I'll stop burning inside, I'll stop wanting everything to change. I'll be happy, I won't need anything. But I keep wavering, esurient and waiting. You search for love, all you need is love, and all you have are memories.\n\n\n\nSide B\n\nSuddenly looking out over the cliffs of a coast, sunglasses and a car by the side of the road, the ocean doesn't end. The sun burns my face, dust on the gravel road seems to move in the breeze, and the face of the ocean seems as a blue plate. I swam above the hairpin bends, and waited on the floating platform. I knew you'd show up. You were even early. My hair was more grey, and your college days made you look happy. I smiled hearing all about your days with friends, reading these books you passed me over the cafe table, remembering the smell of the pages from our home library. You mentioned it too. I know you've grown up to be the same as me, and we only smile, and see it in our eyes. Outside, the shuffling plates and silverware are only background noise. Birds are nearby, staying shaded in the trees. They're always singing the same song. \n\n\n\nTwo stories by Will Long, October 2018\n\n\n\nNote: Please be aware that Bandcamp takes 15% commission for digital items, and 10% for physical items.  bandcamp.com/pricing\n\n Please keep this in mind, and do what you can to support artists and labels.

      "about": "You were in another city, somewhere in the rain, the coastal structures black and windowless, but with slowly pulsing white lights; black lighthouses in the city stream drifting up and over our view. The apartments and offices spread out behind, and all the transparent shades of umbrellas walked across the streets, strewn around like a beach after a storm. I drove over the bridge, there were few railings and from over the hills you could take in every aspect of the city wall, and the bridges beyond. Passing the grey mists and through the giant vents to clean the view, the freeway winded into tunnels, lit in soft yellow and gold, the pipes shining bronze and the lights of other cars passing tracers of red. We had walked together from the center of the city through that maze of umbrellas, the faces of others obscured underneath, seeming asleep through the dewy plastic, walking on and on. We walked for what seemed like 20 minutes to where we always went, as if we didn't need an umbrella. We didn't talk, or didn't need to. When I arrived at your building, it was warm inside like a library. There were lamps along the wall, and all the colors of the furniture seemed dark and in the shadows. When we met it was with smiling and some kind of surprise, as if we hadn't just met hours before, but instead it was what may have been years. I just need to choose which it is.\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2018\n\n\n\n'Shima' is a set of b-side loops that originally were made along with 'Jima', but were not recorded until 2016.\n\n\n\nWill Long: Tape loops, reel-to-reel, reverse reverb, notch filter, digital delay\n\n\n\nVinyl LP released on Gailur Records, 2018.\n\n\n\nNote: Please be aware that Bandcamp takes 15% commission for digital items, and 10% for physical items.  bandcamp.com/pricing\n\n Please keep this in mind, and do what you can to support artists and labels.

You can change something in your life, but it’s usually as a result. I learned a lesson. I gave up a bad habit. New Year’s resolutions. But then I didn’t. We’re supposed to adapt, to conform. No. I wish I had done that. I wish I could do that. I’ll do things differently next time. I might. You should have done that earlier. I wish you were like you used to be. I wish you hadn’t changed. \n\nLittle child, you can change the world. Yes, we can work together for that. I don’t want you to change. Stay just how you are, and don’t let anyone change you. For the meantime, let’s pretend we can keep this moment forever.\n\nRecorded 2018–20, all music by Will Long",

      "about": "Soundscaping Records are very pleased to invite Celer for the label’s second release, Pockets of Wheat, a most special album to us.\n\n\n\nThe album was recorded during a three day journey driving across the US from California to Mississippi, while the musician couple spent their days at a small hotel in Northern Texas. During these three days, they realized the concept of ‘Pockets of Wheat/Exteriors’, created illustrations for their intent of the music and penned down a library of notes and structures to use. Hence, made many field recordings and string recordings with equipment brought along, while other piano pieces were recorded later on an old, unused family piano.\n\n\n\nFrom their room at the back of the hotel, they saw endless stretches of wheat fields. With open windows, the couple noticed the constant sound of the wheat blowing from the wind, an almost gentle, yet persistent, crackling and fuzz, but also changed constantly. Creating music in their original form, drawing on feelings of togetherness, intimacy, and the expansiveness surrounding them, with the ever-changing landscape, the concept of ‘Pockets of Wheat/Exteriors’ was perceived. With associations to the ghost of Algernon Blackwood’s The Willows, in entirety founded in nature, perceptions arose through constant interpretation of the sounds of nature; aggression, subtlety, intimacy, and distance.\n\n\n\nRoughly five hours of recordings of cello, violin, piano, bells, crickets, and wind were then applied the idea of an ‘always changing but always the same’ idea to it. Splicing the recordings to about hundred 5-10 second tape loops, the loops were then played back from laptops and repeated in arbitrarily selected order by the two musicians without predetermined order. As such, the movements of the wheat in the fields by the winds were mimicked: always similar, but constantly changing.\n\n\n\nThe enclosed recording contains 7 movements, though they are strung together not to break the continuity. The several layers found within the recording are not always discernible, but are still there, just more subtle, as is the case with details in nature. Nature’s presence is also an imperative, though not the sole inspiration, but in the end the music of Celer in Pockets of Wheat expresses purely their feelings, identity and the atmosphere surrounding these moments, and in keeping with a continuous recording, captures the essence of what is heard in our daily lives, essentially one singular thing: sound.\n\n\n\nThis is the original, unmastered version of the album. The CD edition is currently out of print.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Vamps (phrases with variation for upright piano)\n\n\n\nFor the uninitiated, to be said simply, Celer is Will Long. Born and raised in the American South, and now living in Japan, Long is a stalwart in the ambient and house music communities, known for his masterful, prolific, and earnest styles. An approachably existential tenderness permeates Long’s work: music and art is a means, not for just expression, but for an existing through. Documentation of time and patience as autoethnographic research. Like his snapshots, including photos used here for artwork, Long’s practice is to turn the quotidian into the transcendent through temperance. Celer has amassed a large body of recordings in his/their nearly 13 years active, and Patient Sounds is honored to contribute to this profound and prodigious legacy. Vamps arrives as a minimal meditation on repeated phrases. Melancholic and contemplative, acoustic piano phrases and cassette tape phasing as a means of meditation. A sunset with the sustain firmly compressed. Time has shifted in that silence, a silent second is an anechoic chamber, feathers caught beating at the lonely light. \n\n\n\nFeather (white) shell / Sustain (gold) imprint\n\n\n\n- Patient Sounds\n\n\n\nCassette available from Patient Sounds",

      "about": "'Inside the head of gods' is an EP of music made to accompany the paintings of Taichi Kondo for his exhibition 'What's my name?' at Finale Art File in Manila, Philippines, April 6 - April 30, 2016. \n\n\n\nWhen I first saw his paintings, they gave me a very clear sound of music. I had many ideas, and there were many elements of each of his paintings to represent through music. When I began creating the music, I made many different kinds of tracks with different lengths, structures, timbres, quiet or loud, rhythmic or not, analog or synthetic, field recordings or noise.. but later, while these different pieces did represent the music, it didn't sound right in a true setting - not with what I imagined the gallery space would represent, and how it would be heard. \n\n\n\nIn the end, I chose to use only the first track I made, which was around 20 minutes of organ music. I listened in different settings, replayed it in different ways, and mixed and remixed it. At first I thought it was too simple and minimal, but when I listened back closely, all of those elements from before were actually there, just in a similar form of each other, rather than separated. Like the paint on a canvas, it's all made of paint - the colors and shapes are what makes it different. \n\n\n\n'Inside the head of gods' is intended to be listened to at medium volume, in random playback mode if available. \n\n\n\nEdition of 300 copies. CD comes packaged in a simple, full color pocket sleeve. Minimal and friendly.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "In the fall of 2012, I was asked to create music for a live yoga event at Yougenji temple in Northern Tokyo. The performance was centered on the yoga instructor with the musician playing to the back of the audience, so that music served more as a live soundtrack for the event. For this I created a new piece of music using two reel-to-reel tape machines, and two tape loops of keyboards with similar time structures, but each with different, overlapping chords. They played simultaneously, crossing in different combinations, and with manual alterations of the volume and high/low settings on the machines. While changing, it maintained the same sound and makeup throughout.\n\n\n\nDuring the performance many people fell asleep, and seemed to drift off to another place. Sometimes it seemed like they were waking up, but it was only the evolution of the yoga exercise matching the music. Surprisingly, throughout the entire performance, and ever since, whenever hearing the piece of music, I am immediately reminded of my grandmother. When I was 6 years old I moved with my parents to the house of my great grandfather, next door to where my father grew up, and where my grandmother still lived. She had been bed-ridden for several years by that time, and would remain so until her death when I was 11. \n\n\n\nSomehow this music continued to fill my mind with those memories of sitting in her room, watching tv late at night with her when my parents were out to dinner, or the hazy lace curtains on the windows, moving in the afternoon breeze. I remembered that stillness, the warmth of her voice without any complaints, despite the restricted isolation, and the ever-present surroundings never changing. Seeing the audience in these motionless-to-waking states brought this memory back to me, though exactly why I can't be sure. However, because of this, the music was given a background, and a dedication. \n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2015\n\n\n\n２０１２年の秋、私は北東京にある養源寺という寺院で行われたヨガ・イベントのための音楽制作を依頼された。そのパフォーマンスは、ヨガ・インストラクターを囲みながらミュージシャンがオーディエンスの背後で演奏するというもので、音楽がイベントのための生のサウンドトラックのような形になっていた。このイベントのために私は、二台のオープンリール・マシンを使って新しい作品を作った。キーボードで作られたコードの異なる二つのテープ・ループは、似たような時間構造で重り合っていた。それらのループは同時に再生しながら様々な組み合わせで交差し、機械上での手動の音量と高域・低域のセッティングによって変化していった。変化しながら、全体を通して一つのサウンドとなっていた。\n\n\n\nパフォーマンスの最中、多くの人々が眠りに落ち、別の場所に行ってしまったかのように見えた。時々、彼らが目を覚ましていくかのように見えたが、それは単にヨガのエクササイズの展開だった。それは音楽にマッチしていた。驚くべきことだが、パフォーマンスの間中、またそれ以来ずっと、その音楽の断片を耳にするたびに、私には祖母のことがすぐに思い起こされる。６歳のとき私は、曾祖父が建てた家に両親とともに移り住んだ。その家の隣には私の父が育った家があり、そこに祖母はまだ住んでいた。祖母はそれまで何年ものあいだ、そして私が１１歳のときに彼女が亡くなるまでずっと寝たきりだった。\n\n\n\nどういうわけかこの音楽が私の心に満たし続ける記憶は、祖母の部屋で座っていたときの思い出だ。\n\n両親が外食に出かけ不在の夜、遅くまで彼女と一緒にテレビを見たこと。窓際で午後のそよ風に揺らされて霞むレースのカーテン。あの静けさ、祖母の暖かい声。制限された孤独と、変化の起きることのない環境のなか、彼女は決して不平をもらさなかった。どうしてかは私にも分からないのだが、静止と覚醒の状態にある観客を見ながら、これらの記憶が私の中によみがえった。しかし、この記憶のおかげで音楽は背景を持ち、祖母に捧げるものとなることができたのだ。\n\n\n\n２０１５年、ウィル・ロング\n\n\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long\n\nRecorded and mixed 2011 - 2015 in Tokyo and Yokohama, Japan\n\nSpecial thanks to Rie Mitsutake\n\nFor M.L.L.\n\n\n\nPlease always keep a backup of your download in an archive.\n\n\n\nNote: Please be aware that Bandcamp takes 15% commission for digital items, and 10% for physical items.  bandcamp.com/pricing\n\n Please keep this in mind, and do what you can to support artists and labels.

      "about": "In 1984, my great uncle drowned in the sea off the coast of Hammamet, Tunisia. He was 80 years old. He arrived in Tunis from his home in New York City, staying one night in the Hotel Amilcar, from where he sent a blank postcard back to his family home in Mississippi. The next day he traveled to Hammamet, where he rented a hotel room, bought swimming trunks, and by the afternoon had drowned in the ocean. \n\n\n\nIn 2015, I retraced his steps from Tunis to Hammamet. Set part in fiction and part in reality, Two Days and One Night is both a document of my own experience and a re-imagining of what my great uncle might have heard and experienced 31 years before. It's a shame he didn't see the burnt orange sunset swirling over the horizon as I did on my departing flight at the end of the second day, but then again, maybe he did.\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2016\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long, composed and collaged in 2014 and 2015\n\nRecorded in North Africa and Tokyo\n\nPostcard cover courtesy of Will Long\n\nDesign by Rutger Zuydervelt\n\n\n\nAvailable on CD from Sequel  www.sequel-label.com\n\n\n\n Note: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "I'm spending the days cataloging books and filling the shelves of the new library. In the early afternoons, the new library employees come in and we learn about their system, and how to work it. It's a 4km walk out of the edge of town, along the hills and red dirt roads with broken palms back to our house. I'll listen to the radio, or the wind as I walk. When I get back you're on the phone with family, and our child is outside the window playing in the sand nearby. When she comes back in to join you and have a snack, I'm already wading in the water, floating on my back, and drifting further out. The clouds in the distance are reaching over the islands, their overcast arms swooping and dropping warm rain. Showers barely pass, and they blow by like shadows against the flickering, distant blue lights of the town. I can see the light from our window when I look up, treading water, and even the ocean seems grey and quiet here in the middle. Behind me is another island, led by a green mountain, grey and black with clouds hanging over. The water moves underneath, a sea snake swims by, and the surf spins. \n\n\n\n- Will Long, Saipan, 2016\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long, recorded 2013 - 2016\n\n\n\nDesign by Rutger Zuydervelt\n\n\n\nAvailable on cassette from Cellar Door Tapes \n\ncellardoortapes.bandcamp.com/album/alcoves\n\n\n\n Note: Please be aware that Bandcamp takes 15% commission for digital items, and 10% for physical items.  bandcamp.com/pricing\n\n Please keep this in mind, and do what you can to support artists and labels.

      "about": "Touring is a strange experience. There are disappointments and surprises. The audience you expected wasn't there, but those shows usually end up being the best. I didn't expect I'd see these cities. Frankfurt in the rain, or falling asleep in the back of a car in Basel, waiting for a show to start. You wake up and you're in a different place, or already moving on to the next before you can experience the place. \n\n\n\nAll the tapes I dubbed for the tour I left in the first hotel, and did the rest on the trains en route. When we walked to the field at Tempelhof, it was totally covered with snow, and it was so cold my camera lens froze. Your hair whipped in the wind like a mustang.\n\n\n\nI remember the taxi interiors in Poland, and how many women wore leather in Russia. I couldn't find bookstores, but it didn't matter. Meeting everyone was the best part of it, you experience these small events during the days or at night, and you think how we'll remember this forever. Then you return home, and never speak with them again.\n\n\n\nTempelhof was recorded on tour in 2013 in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, and Russia.

      "about": "Press text from I, Absentee:\n\n\n\nLaunched in 2005, Celer is a project of Will Long, an American musician, educator, writer and photographer, living in Japan, who also curates the Two Acorns label. Initially a duo based in California with Danielle Baquet, Celer has continued as a solo project since 2009 and has released music on numerous esteemed labels such as Baskaru, Spekk, and/OAR, Infraction, Streamline and many more. In addition, Will has collaborated on projects with Miko, Hakobune, Machinefabriek, Jan and Romke Kleefstra, Matthieu Ruhlmann, Yui Onodera and Christoph Heemann.\n\n\n\nA decade into his recording career, Celer arrives at the shores of the Los Angeles based label I, Absentee, for the remarkable new full-length, \"Jima.\" The album contains two pieces, each occupying an entire LP side, on one side plunging into the depths of the conscience, and the contrasting flip side a blissful crescendo. It stands as a jewel in the prolific career of Celer, showcasing an artist at the height of his craft. Meticulously assembled and packaged at the highest quality possible by both artist and label, it is presented as a meditation on existence and melancholy.\n\n\n\n\"Jima\" arrives at I, Absentee as a limited edition LP, with the first 100 units on sea blue vinyl and the remaining 200 on milky clear vinyl. Limited edition of 300 copies worldwide.\n\n\n\nHear an excerpt here:  soundcloud.com/iabsentee/celer-distant-misgivings\n\n\n\n Note: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Note: This is a slightly different version that was exclusive to the cassette version of this album.\n\n\n\nArtist statement \n\n\n\nA few years ago I took a road trip with my 80-year old uncle through parts of the American southwest. We drove to Moab, where the sunset turned the canyon walls orange in the early evening, and after midnight, passing puffy clouds still showed through the the navy blue sky. In the morning, the buttes seemed brilliant bleached in sunlight, and the view from above the canyon was completely silent save for the wind, and birds occasionally flying past. In the Needles district, the centuries-old petroglyphs were mixed with graffiti; spraypaint cans lying half-submerged rusted in the sand below. We drove through the back roads of the La Sal Mountains, and down across the windswept grey Colorado plateau. \n\n\n\nPast the expanses of Monument Valley, on the outskirts of Kayenta, rainstorms loomed in the distance as teenage hitchhikers dotted the roadsides, along which were makeshift souvenir shops, alone like fireworks stands after a passed holiday. Climbing out of the desert, we passed through Aspen, through the ski resorts and celebrity mansions, where the average annual household income is $69,000, compared to $21,000 in Kayenta. The next day, our drive ended the next day near Ouray, the fog rolling over the evergreen-lined roads. \n\n\n\nSeveral years later, after leaving California, I made a collection of tracks made with an electric piano and a wooden flute. Two tracks were copied onto two sun-baked cassette tapes I had found on the dashboard of a car, and the other two from a warped 12\" test pressing. Revisiting these pieces after living in Japan for several years, they instantly reminded me of the trip, and what I left behind in the United States. The tapes fluttered and stuck, drenched in hiss and grime. The record skipped, wavered, and dropped in and out. Yet with these imperfections, it completely reflected my memory of the places, and what they represented. There are sides to everything, whether it causes you to change or not. \n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2015 \n\n\n\nアーティスト・ステートメント \n\n\n\n数年前、８０歳になる叔父とアメリカ南西部を車で旅したことがあった。我々がドライブをしたモアブという場所では、夕方になると夕日が渓谷の壁をオレンジ色に染め、夜中を過ぎると、濃紺の夜空にふわふわの雲が現われては通り過ぎていった。朝になると、太陽にさらされたビュート（孤立丘）が輝いて見え、渓谷の上からの景色は、風と、時折飛んで行く鳥の音をのぞいては完全な静寂に包まれていた。ニードルズ地区にある、何世紀も前の岩面彫刻には落書きが入り混じっていて、錆びたスプレーペイントの缶が砂地に半分埋もれて残されていた。我々はラ・サル山脈の裏道をドライブして、吹きさらしの灰色のコロラド高原を超えて行った。 \n\n\n\nカエンタ郊外の広々としたモニュメントバレーを過ぎると、遠くのほうにぼんやりと暴風雨が見えた。沿道にはティーンエイジャーのヒッチハイカー達が点在し、簡易な作りの土産店が休日明けの花火の屋台のように寂しそうに並んでいた。砂漠を抜けると、我々はアスペンというスキーリゾートを通り過ぎた。セレブなマンションが立ち並ぶその辺りの一世帯の年収は69,000ドル、一方カエンタでは21,000ドルだ。 \n\n\n\n何年か後になってカリフォルニアを去ったあと、私は電子ピアノと木笛を使って一連の曲を制作した。その中の２曲が、車のダッシュボードの上で陽にあたって劣化したカセットテープの中にコピーされているのを私は発見した。そして残りの２曲は、歪んでしまったテストプレス用のレコードの中にあった。日本に何年か住んだ後でこれらの作品を再検討してみると、あの旅のこと、そして私がアメリカに置いてきたもののことがすぐさま思い起こされた。テープには歪みやひっかかりがあり、ノイズとホコリまみれだった。レコードには音飛びや音揺れがあり、音が大きくなったり小さくなったりした。けれどもこれらの不完全さは、それぞれの場所の私の思い出、そしてそれらが意味するものを見事に象徴していた。すべてのものには、両端がある。それが我々に変化を起こさせるものかどうかにかかわらず。 \n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2015 \n\n\n\n\n\nPress statement \n\n\n\nInspired by the American Southwest, \"How could you believe me when I told you that I loved you when you know I've been a liar all my life\" is the new album by American musician Celer, aka Will Long, now living in Japan. Sourced from an electric piano and wooden flute, tape loops were copied to sun-baked cassette tapes, and a warped vinyl tester, using the most basic format-inherent effects. Based on an idea of primitive Americana, it can be seen as a mediation on the different sides of music and cultural perception, or a reflection of inherent imperfections. \n\n\n\nプレス・ステートメント \n\n\n\nアメリカ南西部にインスパイヤされた \"How could you believe me when I told you that I loved you when you know I've been a liar all my \n\nlife\"は、アメリカ人の音楽家で現在は日本在住のCelerことWill Longのニュー・アルバムである。電子ピアノと木笛を音源にしたテープ・ループを、陽に焼けて劣化したカセットテープと歪んだテスト用レコードにコピーし、フォーマット特有のエフェクトという最も基礎的な方法を用いて制作された。プリミティブ・アメリカーナの一例として、音楽の様々な側面と文化的認知を熟慮した作品であり、また特有の不完全さを熟考した作品といえる。",

      "about": "Have you ever looked up into the sky at night, and it seemed that you could see beyond the stars? How many times have you looked up, but how few do you actually remember? I remember two times: \n\n\n\nThe sky seemed to roll, the stars flickering in the humidity of the late-August evening. It makes your throat feel dry and your body strained. Staring up, \"We can't see stars like this at home\", we said to each other. Lying on the concrete slab behind the garage, and at one time standing, we kept on watching - the factory near of my hometown humming, passing cars on the nearby highway sizzling in the distance. \n\n\n\n…Or when we were in the onsen town in the mountains - there was nowhere to walk to at night, but we trudged through the snow so I could take photos, our shoes soaked and our feet freezing. You could see your breath in the air. You can't hear snow fall. We opened the wooden sliding door and walked back into the warmth of the light. \n\n\n\nThe next day we looked out, all the leaves were brown in the freezing November, and the stars were hidden. The blue river was ahead and down the hill, and we didn't even think about what was or wasn't above from the night before, past the stars now hidden by the sun. \n\n\n\nWhen looking up, the least important thing is what you see - or that there is even anything in space, beyond the blackness. The beauty and the demons share the space where we are already.\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nCD or high-quality digital listening is highly recommended, as some frequencies are eliminated in low-quality MP3s and streaming.\n\n\n\nNote: Please be aware that Bandcamp takes 15% commission for digital items, and 10% for physical items.  bandcamp.com/pricing\n\n Please keep this in mind, and do what you can to support artists and labels.

      "about": "Artist statement\n\n\n\nA few years ago I took a road trip with my 80-year old uncle through parts of the American southwest. We drove to Moab, where the sunset turned the canyon walls orange in the early evening, and after midnight, passing puffy clouds still showed through the the navy blue sky. In the morning, the buttes seemed brilliant bleached in sunlight, and the view from above the canyon was completely silent save for the wind, and birds occasionally flying past. In the Needles district, the centuries-old petroglyphs were mixed with graffiti; spraypaint cans lying half-submerged rusted in the sand below. We drove through the back roads of the La Sal Mountains, and down across the windswept grey Colorado plateau. \n\n\n\nPast the expanses of Monument Valley, on the outskirts of Kayenta, rainstorms loomed in the distance as teenage hitchhikers dotted the roadsides, along which were makeshift souvenir shops, alone like fireworks stands after a passed holiday. Climbing out of the desert, we passed through Aspen, through the ski resorts and celebrity mansions, where the average annual household income is $69,000, compared to $21,000 in Kayenta. The next day, our drive ended near Ouray, the fog rolling over the evergreen-lined roads. \n\n\n\nSeveral years later, after leaving California, I put together a collection of tracks made with an electric piano and a wooden flute. Two tracks were copied onto two sun-baked cassette tapes I had found on the dashboard of a car, and the other two from a warped 12\" test pressing. Revisiting these pieces after living in Japan for several years, they instantly reminded me of the trip, and what I left behind in the United States. The tapes fluttered and stuck, drenched in hiss and grime. The record skipped, wavered, and dropped in and out. Yet with these imperfections, it completely reflected my memory of the places, and what they represented. There are sides to everything, whether it causes you to change or not. \n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2015\n\n\n\nアーティスト・ステートメント\n\n\n\n数年前、８０歳になる叔父とアメリカ南西部を車で旅したことがあった。我々がドライブをしたモアブという場所では、夕方になると夕日が渓谷の壁をオレンジ色に染め、夜中を過ぎると、濃紺の夜空にふわふわの雲が現われては通り過ぎていった。朝になると、太陽にさらされたビュート（孤立丘）が輝いて見え、渓谷の上からの景色は、風と、時折飛んで行く鳥の音をのぞいては完全な静寂に包まれていた。ニードルズ地区にある、何世紀も前の岩面彫刻には落書きが入り混じっていて、錆びたスプレーペイントの缶が砂地に半分埋もれて残されていた。我々はラ・サル山脈の裏道をドライブして、吹きさらしの灰色のコロラド高原を超えて行った。\n\n\n\nカエンタ郊外の広々としたモニュメントバレーを過ぎると、遠くのほうにぼんやりと暴風雨が見えた。沿道にはティーンエイジャーのヒッチハイカー達が点在し、簡易な作りの土産店が休日明けの花火の屋台のように寂しそうに並んでいた。砂漠を抜けると、我々はアスペンというスキーリゾートを通り過ぎた。セレブなマンションが立ち並ぶその辺りの一世帯の年収は69,000ドル、一方カエンタでは21,000ドルだ。\n\n\n\n何年か後になってカリフォルニアを去ったあと、私は電子ピアノと木笛を使って一連の曲を制作した。その中の２曲が、車のダッシュボードの上で陽にあたって劣化したカセットテープの中にコピーされているのを私は発見した。そして残りの２曲は、歪んでしまったテストプレス用のレコードの中にあった。日本に何年か住んだ後でこれらの作品を再検討してみると、あの旅のこと、そして私がアメリカに置いてきたもののことがすぐさま思い起こされた。テープには歪みやひっかかりがあり、ノイズとホコリまみれだった。レコードには音飛びや音揺れがあり、音が大きくなったり小さくなったりした。けれどもこれらの不完全さは、それぞれの場所の私の思い出、そしてそれらが意味するものを見事に象徴していた。すべてのものには、両端がある。それが我々に変化を起こさせるものかどうかにかかわらず。\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nPress statement\n\n\n\nInspired by the American Southwest, \"How could you believe me when I told you that I loved you when you know I've been a liar all my life\" is the new album by American musician Celer, aka Will Long, now living in Japan. Sourced from an electric piano and wooden flute, tape loops were copied to sun-baked cassette tapes, and a warped vinyl tester, using the most basic format-inherent effects. Based on an idea of primitive Americana, it can be seen as a mediation on the different sides of music and cultural perception, or a reflection of inherent imperfections.\n\n\n\nプレス・ステートメント\n\n\n\nアメリカ南西部にインスパイヤされた \"How could you believe me when I told you that I loved you when you know I've been a liar all my\n\nlife\"は、アメリカ人の音楽家で現在は日本在住のCelerことWill Longのニュー・アルバムである。電子ピアノと木笛を音源にしたテープ・ループを、陽に焼けて劣化したカセットテープと歪んだテスト用レコードにコピーし、フォーマット特有のエフェクトという最も基礎的な方法を用いて制作された。プリミティブ・アメリカーナの一例として、音楽の様々な側面と文化的認知を熟慮した作品であり、また特有の不完全さを熟考した作品といえる。\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Dear Jerry,\n\n\n\nI'm somewhere around 20,000 feet, and I think I'm freezing to death. Please send blankets. We're on the way to oversee a polar station in the middle of nowhere. It's 9 hours there, and 9 hours back. On this giant plane, there's only 6 of us. There's somebody in this nose compartment with me, for Arctic topography. He's constantly airsick from staring at the moving ground. As the medical officer, my job is mostly passing out airsick bags, and wearing 3 flight suits so I won't freeze to death.\n\n\n\nI'm looking forward to Thanksgiving dinner next week at home, and I'll be happy to see you. Mother is running in tight circles at home getting ready for the occasion, and Daddy is fasting so he can make the most of the brief period of gluttony. I heard about the menu already, but I'll let that be a surprise for you. It will be great to have a home-cooked meal again. I think we had frozen chicken for dinner last night.\n\n\n\nIt's mid-day now, and all I can see ahead of us is endless flat ice. Thankfully the water system in the BOQ at Ladd is now fixed. For the last few weeks, we've all had to shower next door, and then run at high speed back to our building through the sub-zero temperatures. I'm seriously jealous of you in Guam. Sitting on the beach, playing gold, swimming in the ocean. Want to trade? Alaska is beautiful, if you want a change.\n\n\n\nSee you next week,\n\nBill\n\n\n\nWilliam A. Long, Jr., Fairbanks, November 15, 1960\n\n\n\n\n\nOur flight to Tokyo left at 5pm, following the sunset to the west as we climbed north for 3 hours. The airport was filled with tourists on their way home, with boxes of mangoes and pineapples. It was mango day yesterday. Soon after we got to cruising altitude, the islands disappeared into endless ocean, and everyone seemed to fall asleep. The stewardess offering ice cream passed by unnoticed, and the passengers sank into their straw hats. The lights stay low, but I keep watching out the window, continually sucked into the sunset, and the distant mountains of clouds hanging over the ocean. Even Rie falls asleep, and the outside seems to gently disappear for all the sleeping passengers. The holiday is over, and we're returning home.\n\n\n\nWhen we reach Tokyo, it's already dark, and the farm fields of Narita are dark blue and foggy in the evening mist, the small yellow lights of the houses sitting still under the half-hidden new moon edging over the horizon. Tomorrow I'll develop our film, and we'll start taking pictures again. There are always those leftover shots after a trip, of the just-after-returning from a trip photos. They're of your home, or people and places you see everyday. But maybe in the end, these are the most genuine from the entire roll.\n\n\n\nWill Long, Tokyo, 2013\n\n\n\nClimbing Formation is packaged in a matte-coated, full color digipak, pressed on a glass-mastered CD in an edition of 500 copies.\n\n\n\nYou can hear an excerpt from the album here:  soundcloud.com/entropy-records/er-014-celer-climbing\n\n\n\n Note: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Text by Will Long :\n\n\n\nSeveral years ago while living in the United States, I became interested in the minimalist music of the 1960's and 1970's, and new wave of the early 1980's, with the steady pulses, the constant harmonies, and endless continuity. The music had a strong persistence, and while the listener can drift away from following it consciously, the rhythm stays grounded. In it there is something human, like a heartbeat.\n\n\n\nAt the time I had the idea to use this inspiration with my own music, giving the music a tempo, and a new pathway in a forward direction. I created Zigzag, and agreed to release the album through Spekk, but after several years, the project was delayed, and I went on to other projects, and the initial inspiration and concept disappeared.\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2013, I found out that my wife and I would have our first child. Around this time, plans began to come together for the release of Zigzag. After missing the first few doctor's appointments, I was finally able to attend, and for the first time heard the baby's heartbeat. It seemed like such a fateful connection between the baby and the music. When new life begins, everything points toward the future.\n\n\n\nYou can hear an excerpt of the album here:  soundcloud.com/naturebliss/zigzag-digest\n\n Video:  vimeo.com/85073654\n\n\n\n Note: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "For George and Nina Benson\n\n\n\nI, Anatomy\n\n\n\nMy friend, 103 years old, sat across the room from me, a small gas heater nearby, with photos of family and Martin Luther King, Jr., and we talked for a few hours in the late morning. I had brought him a plant a few years before, and planted it in the front yard, but it had died the winter before. \n\n\n\nA carnival in Costa Mesa, California. Kids screaming on the rollercoasters, the sound of balloons popping, machinery spinning, with smells of beer and popcorn all over the ground. \n\n\n\nIn an airplane flying over Papeete, the safety and welcome announcement CD skipped at such a point that the voices became a looped choir, as the plane coasted in circles around the edges of beaches, and the stewardess ran in the tipping plane in heels to fix the CD. \n\n\n\nWe made a box of tape loops in the Malibu Motel, from strings and pianos, and an old reel to reel tape of Sinatra. From the top of the cliffs, the view was completely clear, and even in a completely black and starless night, nothing stirred. \n\n\n\nA few stories, put together with no previous purpose, than having their own place and time. In being put together, something new is formed. This was the basis for I, Anatomy. There wasn't any intention, it was just a diary. These things happened, and became the source material, finding their directions from what was before directionless, and become the whole. Going back to these moments and memories, I, Anatomy isn't a story, it's one hundred stories. \n\n\n\nArtwork by Christoph Heemann.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "In the summer we met at the halfway point station between our homes, somewhere still new to me. I had to check the route as I was still unfamiliar with the city, but finding undiscovered experiences inside each place. Through the shop-lined streets and the smoke from bars, we found a small shrine atop a tiny hill surrounded by trees. A highway was wrapped around the bottom of one side, and a steel bridge for the bullet trains reaching over the treetops on the other. A few people were visiting the shrine, but they soon disappeared, letting the silence enter the sanctuary with the soft afternoon breeze. Making our way down the hill beside the bridge, down the river-long stone steps leading to the water's edge, people ran in the summer air, their voices echoing throughout and across the riverbanks. We finally settled on a spot on the stone stairway, with riverside bushes to our backs, the bridge to our left, and the sunset to the west over and down the river. We brought out our picnic dinner, the plastic containers I had bought just the day before, and picnicked on the shores of the river. Under the orange sunset, cameras on the ground, this memory remaining for that place too, not just us. It stays there in the wind, in the green of the trees, and the swirls of the river, just as it does in our hearts and minds. These places may seem ordinary, but with them we share all experiences. \n\n\n\n\n\n我々はある夏の日、それぞれの家の中間地点の駅で会った。それは、私にとってはなじみの無い場所だった。私はまだこの街に慣れていなかったので、道順を調べなければならなかったが、それはそれぞれの場所の中にある、未知の体験を見つけることでもあった。店が立ち並ぶストリートや、煙の立ちこめるバーを通り過ぎながら、我々は丘の上に立つ、木々に囲まれた小さな神社を見つけた。片側の下のほうは高速道路で囲まれ、反対側には新幹線が走る鉄橋が木の梢の上に見えた。その神社には何人かの人がいたが、すぐにどこかえ行ってしまった。そして、午後のやわらかな風とともに、その聖域に静かな静寂がやってきた。丘を降りて橋のそばを歩いていくと、川沿いに続く堤防の石段では、水際で夏の空気の中へと駆け込む人々の声が堤防全体に響き渡っていた。我々はやっとのことで、石の階段のところに落ち着ける場所を見つけた。背後には草むらがあって、左手には橋が、向こう岸には、川下へと沈んでいく西日が見えた。我々は準備してきたピクニック・ディナー ー私が前日に買ったばかりのプラスチックの入れ物に入ったものー を取り出して、川岸でピクニックをした。オレンジ色の夕日の下、地面に置かれたカメラ。この記憶は我々だけのためでではなく、あの場所のためにもまた、遺される。風の中に、木々の緑の中に、川の渦の中にとどまる。我々の心の中にとどまるのと同じように。このような場所はありふれたものに見えるかもしれない、でも、我々はこれらの場所によってすべての経験を分かち合う。\n\n\n\nHear an excerpt from the album here:  soundcloud.com/murmurrec/mmr-17-celer-viewpoint-sample\n\n\n\n Note: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Hill towns and empty mountains pass by, but the smoothness of the train blurs the view, and it's easier than ever to fall asleep in the low morning sunlight coming in through the train's windows. We're sleeping, or staring out at the cities and landscapes; it's easy to imagine the sound, and connect it with these events. There's a contrast and connection between this reality and imagination. They're separate, but happening simultaneously. On a walk through the crowded streets of Kyoto, or a half-asleep morning, what was it like? Later, what do you remember? \n\n\n\nDuring a walk home one evening, I stopped on top of the street with a view over the train tracks, passed the intersection across from Mini Stop and the bakery, and went up the hill into the our neighborhood. There's a particular sound when you step on the entrance grate by the doorway, and when opening the mailbox. Someday, I won't be in these same places again, and for now, this is what they sound like. Even these minor moments are important when you look back on the memory, and then look out from this overlook, seeing the city lights blinking in the distance.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "A few years ago I was commissioned by a film company in California to create a musical score for a film inspired by the Hitchcock 1954 film Rear Window, but with a more surrealist, two-sided viewer plot. As filming hadn't begun, I was given the screenplay and timeline, and asked to make specific music that might fit with the themes in those pages, which also included an overture, intermission, and exit music. I recorded the music at home and in a studio provided by the film company in Silverlake, California, and finished a week before the first draft deadline was to be submitted. Surprisingly, before I even delivered any of the music, I was informed that the entire project was cancelled. Several years later, the score for the film of the same title is finally seeing the light of day. It is available on vinyl in an edition of 300 copies by the label Humming Conch from Berlin, with cover art by Peter Lograsso.\n\n\n\n- Will Long, 2013\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded March 2008 in Silverlake, CA\n\nAll Music by Will Long\n\nVocals by Danielle Baquet-Long\n\nMastered by Lawrence English\n\nCover Photo by Peter Lograsso\n\n\n\nReleased on LP by Humming Conch as Conch009\n\n\n\nYou can hear a track from the album here:  soundcloud.com/hummingconch/celer-opening-titles\n\n\n\n Note: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "In June of 2012, I spent several weeks packing to move to a new apartment. Everything was in boxes, and I realized that the majority of my possessions were CDs and vinyl, mostly copies of my own releases. That month, I took many of my own copies of CDs and records to Disk Union, selling them for less than half of wholesale prices, just because I couldn't get rid of them otherwise, and to lighten the load of moving. I got rid of a few keyboards, including a Korg that I found on the street in Ochiai, I ended up leaving for the electronics garbage man. When something in your life is changing, for a while everything seems like a blur, and like you're always moving to a new hotel room. You're going to the same place, but it isn't home yet. There was a pile of boxes in the corner of the room, an open balcony window, and a laptop on the floor. I watched the movie Overboard several times, just because the DVD was still in my computer, and hadn't been packed up with everything else. Unpacking slowly, things began to come out, and piece themselves together into functionality again. In boxes of randomness I found some tapes of unused recordings, made sometime in my older apartment, for a show at Forestlimit in Hatagaya a few weeks before, when I used an open cassette player for live modulation. All those recordings came together, and once cut to length, fit as individual pieces of a wider whole. It took several weeks, but the pieces with no place eventually find somewhere, and fit, whether it was the intention or not. Then, most importantly, they have a home.\n\n\n\nReleased on cassette from Prairie Fire Tapes, catalog PF050, November 2012.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "\"Tightrope was created in 2010. That November I visited Tokyo to tour with Yui Onodera to promote our Generic City album. On the last Saturday of the tour, I took part in a collaboration performance at a temple in Tokyo with Opitope and Corey Fuller, where I played some of the source pieces used in Tightrope. It was unfinished, but when I returned to my home it was completed in a short time. One month later, on December 31st 2010, I moved to Tokyo.\n\n\n\nThough presented as one continuous track without breaks, Tightrope is a collage of 24 separately titled pieces. Layer upon layer, they were mixed on top\n\n on top\n\n on top\n\n on top\n\n on top on top\n\n on top on top\n\n on top on top\n\n on top on top on top\n\n\n\n on top\n\non top of each other, and given a single place.\n\n\n\nIt has many different instruments and sound sources. Piano, television, synthesizers, fire crackling in the fireplace, whistling, pipe organ, eating ice, acoustic guitar, laptop, an afternoon conversation, a medicine drip buzzer, car noise, my ringtone, contact mic and many others I can't remember. At the time, it never occurred to me to keep track of these things. In the end, they're all collected, unplanned memories.\" - Will Long, Tokyo, January 2012\n\n\n\nDesign by mondii, published in an edition of 500 copies.

      "about": "Celer is the solo ambient project of sound artist Will Long, who works out of Tokyo, Japan. He is well known for producing dense, emotive creations that are never lost in the gloom of myriad other ambient releases, due to the remarkable delicacy of each layer of sound in his pieces, which never become overwhelming or too drawn-out to to sustain their initial emotional content, as is so often the case with many extended ambient compositions.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the thought that goes into Celer releases is evident from the incredibly detailed titles that Long has given to each of the three tracks on Epicentral Examples of the More or Less, with each small portion of the title being relevant to an individual phase within each overall track – an arrangement choice which is made, on listening, into a feat of compositional skill, due to the fact that the tracks, even when starkly cutting between samples of reversing tapes, field recordings, and Celer's trademark throbbing, glowing drones, at no point ever sound merely like a compilation of small pieces. \n\n\n\nRather, the album remains cohesive overall, and whilst at points the listener is met with surprises in the form of phasing waves of bright sequencers - a sound that many would never have imagined Long using after listening to releases such as Evaporate and Wonder - or even acid-house synth waves on Fill Your Light With Lessness from the third and final track - Epicentral Examples of the More or Less retains the genuine emotive content that has become a cornerstone of Celer releases, coupled with a creative talent that leaves most contemporary ambient music dead in the water.\n\n\n\nRecorded over two years in Jakarta, Indonesia and Tokyo, Long appears to have had time to revisit these recordings over and over again, allowing him to produce a release that is simultaneously a step forward for Celer's sound, and the level of musical wizardry that the rest of the ambient scene must now aspire to reach.\n\n\n\nCurrently out of print.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess. Thank you.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "According to Discogs, Celer (Will Long) has 76 releases, and Machinefabriek (Rutger Zuydervelt) 99. You can add one to both, 'cause Will and Rutger joined forces to create the 7-inch 'Maastunnel/Mt. Mitake'. Originally meeting and performing in Tokyo together in November 2010, the two began a collaboration in October 2011 by sending audio files back and forth. By the end of November, two tracks were completed, constructed from hours of material, 'materializing' the Tokyo-Rotterdam connection.\n\n\n\nThe artwork was found by Will Long in a nostalgia shop in Jimbocho, Tokyo, the area famous for its many used bookshops, and the sleeve was designed by Rutger Zuydervelt. 'Mt. Mitake' is a mountain to the west of Tokyo, which Will Long climbed on the day between finding the artwork, and finishing the track. The other piece is called 'Maastunnel', named after the tunnel that connects the banks of the Nieuwe Maas in Rotterdam. You'll hear recordings of the tunnel's old wooden escalators, creating a fascinating symphony of squeaks and howls.\n\n\n\n'Maastunnel/Mt. Mitake' was created to celebrate the upcoming Celer / Machinefabriek tour of The Netherlands and Belgium in March of 2012.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

They got the hang of it and decided to make it into a trilogy of 7\" singles, all self-released in limited editions. Now, Irrational Arts is compiling the six tracks of the 7\"s onto a CD‚ titled Compendium (Collected Singles and Remixes), including an additional new track by the Celer and Machinefabriek, and remixes by Stephan Mathieu, Sylvain Chauveau and Nicolas Bernier. The artwork of the CD continues the design style of the singles, with collages of old Japanese cards and ephemera.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Since 2005, Celer, the duo of the late Danielle Marie Baquet and William Thomas Long, have released a wealth of ambient material and established themselves as one of the preeminent and best loved outfits in the genre. For the uninitiated, Celer's aesthetic is glacial, beautiful and devotional. It is utterly devoid of hard edges and culled from a wealth of exotic and traditional instrumentation. The pair's inimitable sound is the result of careful attention to processing and a keen, quasi-cinematic ear for arrangement and juxtaposition. The source material for the recordings on Evaporate and Wonder was limited to improvised synthesizers and field recordings, but the end results are predictably grand and mysterious, suitable indeed for the promises of the album's title. Comprised of two sidelong pieces, this record is a perfect entry point into the pair's wonderful oeuvre or, if you're like me, a more than welcome audio pictogram that lets us as listeners continue the journey.\n\n\n\nReleased on LP. Currently out of print.\n\n\n\nNote: Track 3, \"Melange of Past Impressions and Recent Knowledge\" is a previously unreleased C-side.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess. Thank you.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Live performances recorded in The Hague, Brussels,\n\nMaastricht, Deventer, Utrecht, Leiden and Drachten, March 2012.\n\n\n\nIn March 2012, we had a tour of the Netherlands and Belgium together with Kleefstra|Bakker|Kleefstra. Seven gigs in total, which were all improvised. It was the first time we played together, and we didn't rehearse. It might not have been brilliant all the time, but there was definitely some kind of magic going on sometimes. Not knowing what the other would do, these concerts were as exciting for us as (hopefully) for the audience. Trying to do something different each time, things got weirder and weirder with each performance, up to a point where it became really hard to keep a straight face while performing. It was simply a whole lot of fun, and an experience that seems worth sharing. It made the most sense to share it in the purest way, with all concerts in unedited form, from the first one to the last. These recordings, along with a postcard set with Will's photos, form the set 'Greetings from Celer & Machinefabriek', which is available for 5 euros.\n\n\n\nAll music by Will Long and Rutger Zuydervelt\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "\"In February of 2008, Dani and I recorded, mixed, and completed the music for 'Salvaged Violets'. The words came as the subject line of a short poem, sent to me over email, included with an unrelated question. During these weekdays, our working schedules were almost the opposite, but we spoke over email constantly. Until recently, I did not notice how similar this was to our beginnings, sending letters as we were on different sides of the country. With no conceptual idea in mind, and since we were apart for so much time during the weekdays, we decided to begin 'Salvaged Violets', and see what came of it. Every night when I returned home, before sleeping, I would spend time working on the music that Dani had worked on through the afternoon, and had left on the desk. Every afternoon, she would find a different version to work on that I had left, and this continued for some time. When together, we would sip our tea, laugh at silly jokes, cook, watch television, and so on. There was no need for longing while we were together. There was always laughing, pots and pans clanging, or a muttering television. In forming 'Salvaged Violets', we did not mix it in a particular arranged order. It was mixed simply by the order it was first played, compiling many miniature sections rolled into one. In this case, they were rolled into two. Nothing was discarded, nothing was rearranged. As the sound changed over time, the original form did not. When it was finally complete, we listened together, for the first time. I remember how familiar it seemed, yet I also felt that so much of it was unknown, and undefined. More than a year later, in September of 2009, I revisited the recordings for the first time since 2008. At this time, it was being mastered by our good friend Corey Fuller, so I was still listening to the original. Riding my bike through the endless suburban subdivisions, through the busy downtown streets, I listened repeatedly, for days, over and over. Something was familiar, but so much I was unable to recall, and yet I was able to relate. I returned home, put my bike against the door, and took my headphones off. There, in the still silence, I think I understood finally what it was about.\" Will Long, December 2009\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "For this collaboration work, I made a lot of field recordings. Songs of migratory birds that come to a big lake only in winter, the sound of breaking ice, frozen on a lake, the peal of huge bells in a temple, voices in prayer to the Buddha, footsteps in the subway, on the ground, made by coming and going people, machine sounds at a construction site, rain flowing into a steel pipe with a hard sound, the oscillation sound of rubbing iron which was recorded through a contact mic set on steel, the conversation of people walking in the city, noise of vehicles and trucks, kids voices from an elementary school, and so on. Like a time trip to transcend places, these sound-scapes are presented as a imaginary tale. To collaborate with foreign artists became a chance for facing Japan again for me. Reflecting on each of our localities to compose let us be aware anew of the vernacular which has been lost in the global world. Artists can't be unrelated to the characteristics (culture) of places (surroundings) where they live, and they are influenced obliviously in some way. By watching our everyday surroundings closely, we can engender a most realistic language of where we live, and how we think. I sense that peculiar, unfamiliar cultures and customs are invaluable wealth in human history. - Yui Onodera \n\n\n\n\n\nIn this collaboration work with Yui Onodera, we contributed many instrument sounds, and field recordings such as the streets of Los Angeles, rain on our doorstep, water draining into the gutter, cars passing on wet and slippery streets, people walking on their way home from work, talking in an airport baggage claim, crosswalks, airliners flying over, taxi rides, riding bikes through traffic, conversations in restaurants, the Metro Link train in Los Angeles, and walking on quiet streets. In our part of mixing, since we were working with someone's instrument sounds and field recordings from a city that we haven't visited, much was left to our imagination to re-create an environment and city setting for the piece. Trying to keep a balance between the heavily processed material and the entirely unprocessed material, created a natural bridge of movement inside the city. Processed elements became backdrops and scores to real activity, sometimes simply drifting away from the daily life, or the finding the soul of the pieces. When these two entirely different cities came together, it created an all new way of looking at, and hearing the city's movements around us. Cultures parallel one another, with the views of the skylines and empty streets left the only visible evidence of similarity. - Danielle Baquet-Long, Will Long\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "“I remember photos and negatives of sun-scorched Nepal scattered around the floor, notebooks written in randomly and seeming empty, and the evening lights of the outside night that seemed like they wouldn’t ever darken. We drove to Santa Ana over the 405 freeway to record the cars going by, but ended up watching the lights, buying whisky, and sitting the car listening to scratched Joanna Newsom CDRs and Eno’s Discreet Music. When the night was finally asleep and quiet, everything seemed still and the streets seemed dead, except for the swaying palm trees, and the glow from the kitchen light that was never turned off. Even the things that don’t exist anymore are still there, even if they aren’t apparent and obvious as much as they once were”.\n\n\n\nNow available for the first time on CD in an edition of 222 copies as the inaugural release of DRONARIVM, it includes photography by Danielle Baquet-Long, and design by Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek).\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "Dying Star was recorded in the fall of 2008, using only a vintage analog synthesizer and mixing board. It was completely improvised, with no overdubs or post-processing. The intention was to produce a completely improvised work while remaining completely pure and secluded, the resulting recording stands as a fading presentation of memory, time, and loss, set against the ending day.\n\n\n\nPresented at a low volume, the ideal and intended procedure for listening is with headphones, with the volume set specifically at 80%. Through intimacy, tenderness, and isolation, the resulting imaginings are stately presented, yet consistently withering away; and throughout the duration, energy pushes forward, strains, explodes, but eventually crumbles.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "Musically, all of the sounds contained on ‘Brittle’ were created by piano, violin, cello, tingsha bells, harpsichord, and whistle. There are also field recordings from the inside of a room, with the windows open, but containing largely only room noise. The resulting recordings were then structured into 19 different tracks, which were then restructured into one single forming track of 74 minutes. All of the different pieces were merged together, to blur interruption and to allow the possibility of unfocused repetition.\n\n\n\nThe album is arranged to move in a specific way, not simply section by section, but by subtle movements that swell and sway calmly. Instead of creating an environment to sink into, Celer hope that the piece will instead act as a blanket, moving with the listener through gentle sways, shifting tones and small spaces of silence that are as unpredictable as thought.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "‘Mane Blooms’ is the very first vinyl release by Celer, the husband and wife duo Will Long and Danielle Baquet-Long\n\n\n\nSeen by Celer as an 'outdoor' companion piece to ‘Brittle’, the duo’s album recently released on Low Point, the music on ‘Mane Blooms’ was created by multiple layers of cello and piano, which were then processed and played back at differing speeds. Also contained within the tracks are field recordings taken whilst Dani rode horses along the Californian coastline, a weekly pursuit that acted as a form of self-therapy and enjoyment.\n\n\n\nWith the music composed specifically with the vinyl medium in mind, the two sides of the record act as a mirror image. For the B side, Celer approached the music of the first track in reverse, inverting the structure and musical motifs established within the first piece. Altering the playback speed of the vinyl brings previously hidden textures to the fore, providing each of the tracks with a new identity and a different reflection of memory.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess. Thank you.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "All recordings contained on this cassette were made between 2005 and 2008, using only a Jaymar Toy Piano, and a Heintzman Upright Piano. All tracks were recorded only to cassette tape. The tracks include cassette loops made from original recordings, improvisational piano pieces, and organized pieces. In the event when electronic processing was used, cassette tape remained the single method of recording. We hope to demonstrate an admiration of experimentation through a single recording medium, and to dedicate our humble use of the piano to the American pianists of the 1920's.\n\n\n\nPlease support artists by purchasing the digital album, not streaming in excess.

      "about": "Breeze of Roses began in late 2005 when Danielle Baquet-Long and Will Long (together known as Celer) spent a long weekend on the banks of Lake Attersee in Austria. During a break in a rainstorm, a one-hour recording was made in the belly of a docked sailboat, consisting of a mini-piano, whistles, and cello. A direct field recording, containing the thumps and thuds of water against the bottom of the boat and the wind howling outside of the open hatch, was also used. This recording was left untouched until 2007, when Celer picked up where they left off. Drawing Inspiration from the memories of Attersees’ rosewind the old recoding brought back, Celer restructured these cold and early sounds, through processing and editing, into something romantic, representative, and perpetual.\n\n\n\nPresented in 6 imprecise parts, Breeze of Roses continues Celer’s amazing ability to take simple tones and field recordings and create breathtaking emotional landscapes that echo the movement and romance of a classical composition without sacrificing a modern edge.\n\n\n\nThe photography accompanying this release are by artist Peter Lograsso. The cover image Night (2005), a silver rag print, and the inside cover is Last Seen (2005).\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Recorded in 2007 and 2008, Cursory Asperses was created with cassette tape recordings of water sounds from various rivers, streams, lakes, beaches, and pools, combined with direct to tape instrument recordings from synthesizers, an organ, cello, piano, and bowed instruments.\n\n\n\nInstead of traditionally mixing these, at the time we were interested in\n\nsoftware, using free Mac OS Classic programs such as Audiosculpt and\n\nSoundhack. Before we had a DAW, before VSTs, we used non-realtime\n\nconvolution processing through software, using the water recordings as an impulse for the instrument sounds. The instrument sounds were\n\n\"arranged\" (by adding silence before, during, or after) in layered, visual\n\nswathes, to create an audio interpretation of the movement of water and waves, slowly evolving and shifting, for a meditation on deep and focused listening. Opposed to passivity, where sounds become lost in distant tones and layers upon layers are misinterpreted as single, meaningless tones.\n\n\n\nOr, it's just as meaningless as the passing of water, the flow of rivers - the crashes of sparkling ocean waves, all those sounds that we recognize. The tones are unpolished, left in their fuzzy form, with the high noise crushed into the deep. Behind the swells, and under the depths is a longing, or a lack thereof. It's passing by, no different than it was years before.",

      "about": "In November of 1938, Samuel Barber's 'Adagio for Strings' was broadcast on radio for the first time. It was regarded as \"full of pathos and cathartic passion\", and \"perfect in mass and detail\". While it was generally well-received, it was also criticized as \"suffering from repetitiousness\", and being \"dull and utterly anachronistic.\" It is often labeled as 'the saddest music in the world', and is one of the most recognizable pieces of popular classical music. In an interview with the New York Times before his death in 1981, Barber said \"I wish people would listen to my other compositions.\" \n\n\n\n'I love you so much I can't even title this', inspired by the music of Samuel Barber, was recorded in 2008, processed on tape and a laptop. The title alluded to a Morrissey song, and she once summed it up by calling it 'the laziest title I've never written'. I remember painting the handmade die-cut sleeves in the garage, having to hold a rag over my nose and mouth to keep out the fumes. At the time, it seemed like an exercise. Studying poetry had distanced us from the world - and did we think anyone was even paying attention, anyway? The theme was overwhelmingly obvious, and the title was direct. A few years later I chose a photo for the cover of a cemetery in New Orleans - another direct message, yet like everything else, entirely unintentional. You'd be surprised how beautiful the cemetery was that day in the sun, and how you'd probably be wrong about every other assumption, as well. But then, what does that matter, either? Music only has to be. \n\n\n\nOriginally self-released in 2008 as 'I love you so much I can't even title this (The light that never goes out went out)' on CDR in a handmade, limited edition.\n\n\n\n'I love you so much I can't even title this' is available on 2xLP on sky blue, white, and black vinyl from Infraction, remastered by Taylor Deupree.\n\n\n\nRelease date: May 26, 2016 \n\n\n\nRecorded 2008 by Celer. Will Long & Danielle Baquet-Long. \n\nLP mastered by Taylor Deupree \n\nLayout by Timothy O'Donnell\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "Press statement:\n\n\n\nPolar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), also known as \"nacreous clouds\", are found in the winter polar stratosphere at altitudes of 15,000–25,000 metres (50,000–80,000 ft). Due to their high altitude and the curvature of the surface of the Earth, these clouds will receive sunlight from below the horizon and reflect it to the ground, shining brightly well before dawn or after dusk. PSCs form at very low temperatures, below −78 °C. These temperatures can occur in the lower stratosphere in polar winter. In the Antarctic, temperatures below −88 °C frequently cause type II PSCs. Such low temperatures are rarer in the Arctic. Apart from arctic regions, PSCs have also been known to be seen in Scandinavia, Iceland, Alaska and Northern Canada. Sometimes, however, they occur as far south as England.\n\n\n\n\"Nacreous Clouds\", created using tape loops and digital processing, is Celer's third album to be released on a label, and was originally issued in 2008 on and/OAR in a CD edition of 300 copies. To coincide with the 10-year release anniversary, it has been remastered by Stephan Mathieu, and is presented with new artwork and packaging, reissued on Two Acorns.\n\n\n\nPlayback using the random shuffle mode, repeat, or sequential play of your CD player is highly recommended.\n\n\n\nNote: Please be aware that Bandcamp takes 15% commission for digital items, and 10% for physical items.  bandcamp.com/pricing\n\n Please keep this in mind, and do what you can to support artists and labels.

      "about": "The album 'Mesoscaphe' is a sound work dedicated to the 1969 voyage of the Ben Franklin, the naturally-propelled submarine created to explore the currents of the Gulf Stream, and the nature of the sea. Half of the sound is composed of original pieces of music, meant to symbolize a deepening human element culled from memory, from strings, pianos, and electronics. The other half of the sound is composed of natural field recordings, of the Ben Franklin itself, as well as the surrounding oceans and habitats, with the intention of providing realism through sound, just as if it were an actual document from the voyage, of the surrounding ocean. The artists exchanged their own original sounds with each other, allowing each artist to experiment and remix outside of their own sound sources, with the potential to apply our own sound methods to each others' sound sources, and develop the concept even further. Titles were made to coordinate with the movement of the voyage, creating their own story, in relation to the progressing sounds. The final result is a documented literary and audio interpretation of the voyage, from the perspective of 3 sound and visual artists, of the experiences and surroundings of the crew of the Ben Franklin, traveling for 30 days by the gentle glide of the Gulf Stream. We hope to bring attention to an important event in history, overshadowed by the moon landings, and for people to know the story of the revolutionary submarine that explored the nature of the ocean, challenged scientific development, and ended up in a salvage yard.\n\n\n\nNote: Please always keep a backup of your download in an archive.",

      "about": "\"Belsslsssll\" is one of the earliest non-tape centric albums we made, just starting out using dual-computer processing around 2005-2006. It was sourced entirely from bell sounds and recordings. Though I've been reluctant to make it available again in any form as it doesn't feel very representative of anything made since then, it is still an early experimentation and part of the learning process, and in that setting, everything has some place and purpose.\n\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\n\nOriginally self-released in 2006 and released digitally (in the bygone netlabel era) on Rope Swing Cities.\n\n\n\nThe cover is a polaroid taken in Ridgecrest, California, 2007.",
