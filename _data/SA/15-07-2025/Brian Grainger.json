      "about": "Having now entered into its eighth year of recordings, the Workingman's Drone series will again issue twelve more monthly installments of held-tone compositions, exploring combinations of any eight voices from my studio's long list of synthesizers, mixers, software, FX processors and modular components. While these aspects of Workingman's remain the same, along with the fixed 55:55 runtime on the recordings, every year offers the chance to cast these sessions in a different light, considering different purposes, themes, placements. \n\n\n\nIn 2023, the theme varied from month to month, naming sessions for interesting locations, events or phenomenon that I've long been fascinated about. In 2024, all twelve pieces were named for still-living ancient trees from around the world. Now 2025 has arrived, and the world feels markedly worse than ever before, with so many parts of our lives held in the thrall of negative forces - war, political divides, economic destabilization, racism, classism, sexism, ethnocentrism and nationalism, the list is just endless. In spite of all of those things, which remain important issues to be aware of, they and we as humans remain at the mercy of the planet herself, and although it should go without saying that there can be no humanity without the Earth, it feels truly horrific for me to see how close to the precipice we really are as a species. \n\n\n\nI am writing, of course, about climate change, and here specifically you will find a new drone wall each month dedicated to the memory of glaciers around the world that are either receding, or have already disappeared entirely. The effects of ice loss are immense, worldwide and catastrophic, and even if every government in the world began to actively fight against it (they aren't) it would still be impossible to return things to the way they were before. Things are worse, and will still become worse, and there isn't anything that the grand majority of us can even do besides talk about it. So I'm talking about it. \n\n\n\nOr, more accurately, I am droning about it. I am both reckoning with and escaping from the world in the only way I have ever really known how - by sitting down in my studio with all my strange machines, perhaps with a cup of coffee or tea, perhaps with a green pipe, and building a wall, one waveform at a time. It bears repeating that no matter the state of the world around us, no matter how bleak the future may become, or how traumatic the past may have been, all we ever have is the present moment, the always here and yet impossible to grasp 'now' - and drone music, as I've also written about it before, is exceptionally good at suspending one's perception of time, sometimes even spatial considerations, elongating the moment of now into a seamless MÃ¶bius strip to pour your mind down, unable to tell whether you're arriving or departing. \n\n\n\nDrone music is the last music, the closest we can come in an artistic expression to approximating absolute stillness. And while it is still here being made in such a rudimentary way with wooden and stone tools like electricity and vibrating air (by comparison to the impossible mathematical stillness, the real and true emptiness of zero), it is what I consider to be my contribution to the long lineage of stillness in visual art - from the frozen light in the air of the Dutch masters, to the reduced lines and blocks of Rothko and Mondrian, and further still to Claesz, whose fruit and wine covered tabletops seem to exist completely outside of time. These recordings, for me, still manage to convey a wealth of thought and expression, to such a degree that they no longer feel like \"minimalism\" to me anymore. They are filled with color, texture, temperature and the melodiousness of overtones and intervallic relationships. They are dense with harmony, a distillation of emotional content, and they say everything I wish to say, at this stage of my life.\n\n\n\nFurther reading:  \n\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850\n\n  glaciercasualtylist.rice.edu\n\n  www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-mountain-glaciers\n\n  www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/glacier-retreat\n\n\n\n ---\n\n\n\nJune's eight held tones are: \n\n\n\n1.

      "about": "Having now entered into its eighth year of recordings, the Workingman's Drone series will again issue twelve more monthly installments of held-tone compositions, exploring combinations of any eight voices from my studio's long list of synthesizers, mixers, software, FX processors and modular components. While these aspects of Workingman's remain the same, along with the fixed 55:55 runtime on the recordings, every year offers the chance to cast these sessions in a different light, considering different purposes, themes, placements. \n\n\n\nIn 2023, the theme varied from month to month, naming sessions for interesting locations, events or phenomenon that I've long been fascinated about. In 2024, all twelve pieces were named for still-living ancient trees from around the world. Now 2025 has arrived, and the world feels markedly worse than ever before, with so many parts of our lives held in the thrall of negative forces - war, political divides, economic destabilization, racism, classism, sexism, ethnocentrism and nationalism, the list is just endless. In spite of all of those things, which remain important issues to be aware of, they and we as humans remain at the mercy of the planet herself, and although it should go without saying that there can be no humanity without the Earth, it feels truly horrific for me to see how close to the precipice we really are as a species. \n\n\n\nI am writing, of course, about climate change, and here specifically you will find a new drone wall each month dedicated to the memory of glaciers around the world that are either receding, or have already disappeared entirely. The effects of ice loss are immense, worldwide and catastrophic, and even if every government in the world began to actively fight against it (they aren't) it would still be impossible to return things to the way they were before. Things are worse, and will still become worse, and there isn't anything that the grand majority of us can even do besides talk about it. So I'm talking about it. \n\n\n\nOr, more accurately, I am droning about it. I am both reckoning with and escaping from the world in the only way I have ever really known how - by sitting down in my studio with all my strange machines, perhaps with a cup of coffee or tea, perhaps with a green pipe, and building a wall, one waveform at a time. It bears repeating that no matter the state of the world around us, no matter how bleak the future may become, or how traumatic the past may have been, all we ever have is the present moment, the always here and yet impossible to grasp 'now' - and drone music, as I've also written about it before, is exceptionally good at suspending one's perception of time, sometimes even spatial considerations, elongating the moment of now into a seamless MÃ¶bius strip to pour your mind down, unable to tell whether you're arriving or departing. \n\n\n\nDrone music is the last music, the closest we can come in an artistic expression to approximating absolute stillness. And while it is still here being made in such a rudimentary way with wooden and stone tools like electricity and vibrating air (by comparison to the impossible mathematical stillness, the real and true emptiness of zero), it is what I consider to be my contribution to the long lineage of stillness in visual art - from the frozen light in the air of the Dutch masters, to the reduced lines and blocks of Rothko and Mondrian, and further still to Claesz, whose fruit and wine covered tabletops seem to exist completely outside of time. These recordings, for me, still manage to convey a wealth of thought and expression, to such a degree that they no longer feel like \"minimalism\" to me anymore. They are filled with color, texture, temperature and the melodiousness of overtones and intervallic relationships. They are dense with harmony, a distillation of emotional content, and they say everything I wish to say, at this stage of my life.\n\n\n\nFurther reading:  \n\n\n\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retreat_of_glaciers_since_1850\n\n  glaciercasualtylist.rice.edu\n\n  www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-mountain-glaciers\n\n  www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/glacier-retreat\n\n\n\n ---\n\n\n\nApril's eight held tones are: \n\n\n\n1.

      "about": "The Workingman's Drone series continues, changes, stays the same, and as I sit here watching the snow fall outside, held safely inside my wooden studio, considering the natural world as I often do while I write or patch or design, I once again feel that this ritual of ascetic minimalism is not a wall between myself and that world, but a communion with it.\n\n\n\nI considered taking a year off from Workingman's, having run it continuously each month since 2021 when it resumed with Year Four, but the recent studio additions of powerful wavetable synthesizers, as well as multiple machines with re-flashable firmware options, led me to feel that there was still plenty of richness to be found in the series' current trajectory.\n\n\n\nYear Seven follows the last two years of \"Held Tones\" sessions while also shifting its focus away from disparate points of interest around the world (either locations, events or structures that have fascinated me) as its writing prompts, and returning to the \"roots\" of Workingman's Drone, so to speak, with direct connections to trees. The series began with a simple visual indicator of two fir trees, which through the years would grow in size, and expand in number, until Year Five replaced terrestrial flora with imagined (perhaps cosmic) flora, sampled from the inexplicable Voynich Manuscript. So, while Year Seven continues this visual tradition of sampling from that source, the twelve writing prompts now reference twelve of the oldest living trees in the world, which bear individual names, and hold deep historical connections with their surroundings.\n\n\n\nThematic directions aside, the music offered here is identical in approach to Years Five and Six of Workingman's - a fixed number of voices, be they oscillators, LFOs, self-oscillating filters, noise generators, really any sound generator that can sustain a single tone, tuned by ear, panned and mixed accordingly. Year Seven will explore a system of seven tones, likely to be in a combination of mono and stereo, but always balanced and symmetrical, and designed to remain untouched for the duration of the recording.\n\n\n\nFrom here, to another year of composing by way of listening, to another year of seeking stillness in that most paradoxical realm of oscillation, another year of stepping away and listening instead of speaking, always returning to the Earth, always becoming the world instead of outrunning it.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nDecember's seven held tones are: \n\n\n\n1. Ornament & Crime (Quadraturia, waveform 124, 124.38 hertz)\n\n2. Ornament & Crime (Quadraturia, waveform 124, 3/2 of voice 1, XOR/AM by voice 1)\n\n3. Ornament & Crime (Quadraturia, waveform 124, 5/4 of voice 1)\n\n4. Ornament & Crime (Quadraturia, waveform 124, 2/1 of voice 1, XOR by voice 1, AM by voice 3)\n\n5. Ornament & Crime (Vector LFO, sinewave, 62 hertz)\n\n6. Ornament & Crime (Vector LFO, inverse sinewave, 62 hertz)\n\n7. Ornament & Crime (Vector LFO, smooth novel waveform, 64 hertz)\n\n\n\nVoices 1-4 mixed via Doepfer A-135-2 VC mixer, with 1+2 summed and sent through 2HP LPF low pass filter and 3+4 summed and sent through Doepfer A-121-3 low pass filter. Both filter outs sent into Doepfer A-138s for hard L/R panning, then into Buchla 292t Quad Lo Pass Gate in combo mode, then into Strymon Magneto's L/R inputs, with Magneto's outputs sent into Toppobrillo Minimix. Voices 5+6 sent directly into Toppobrillo Minimix, hard panned L/R. Voice 7 sent to Dave Smith Instruments DSM03 where it was low-pass filtered and augmented with a feedback signal, before being sent mono into Toppobrillo Minimix. Everything recorded live in Goldwave from the system with zero post-processing.",

      "about": "Recorded over the end of 2014 and the start of 2015, and released on 22nd January 2015, \"Starshield\" was an experimental work built from a convoluted processing of a human voice reciting a specific phrase. What that phrase was, I no longer know, as I apparently decided to withhold that detail ten years ago, and I cannot remember now what it may have been. \n\n\n\nIn some ways, this is fitting, because \"Starshield\" is so singularly ambiguous in its own weird atmosphere - vacillating between areas of chordal sustain with pedal-bass melodic stability and sheets of modulated noise, all funneled through a narrow compressor window that crumbles the sound at its edges in the moments when it attempts to overwhelm the space it inhabits. It feels a bit like being lost in a snowstorm, seeing glimpses of light or landmarks in between the white wall that blows out your senses and dulls your awareness of time. \n\n\n\nI have revisited \"Starshield\" with a very conservative remaster, mostly dialing down some of the harshness in the upper registers and pulling back on some of the resonant midranges that ring in the ears unnecessarily, while augmenting the lower end of the piece with just a bit more heft and weight to anchor it. Alongside this slight revision is a \"derivation,\" which consists of a molecular-level re-sampling and re-processing of \"Starshield,\" reiterated here in a more tonal wall that chooses to focus on the warmth and provides, I think, an apt counterpoint to the original piece. \n\n\n\nBoth the remaster and the new variation are offered here digitally for a \"nice price\" to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the work. Listeners who have enjoyed the Microdot Transmissions line, or my output as Limestone Ziggurat, will likely find a lot to enjoy here, and \"Starshield\" remains a unique artifact in the landscape of the prior catalog, especially alongside serial things like Workingman's Drone that overshadow it.",

The series began with a simple visual indicator of two fir trees, which through the years would grow in size, and expand in number, until Year Five replaced terrestrial flora with imagined (perhaps cosmic) flora, sampled from the inexplicable Voynich Manuscript.

Year Seven will explore a system of seven tones, likely to be in a combination of mono and stereo, but always balanced and symmetrical, and designed to remain untouched for the duration of the recording.\n\n\n\nFrom here, to another year of composing by way of listening, to another year of seeking stillness in that most paradoxical realm of oscillation, another year of stepping away and listening instead of speaking, always returning to the Earth, always becoming the world instead of outrunning it.\n\n\n\n---\n\nOctober's seven held tones are: \n\n\n\n1. NonlinearCircuits Fourier (Output 1 / Sine)\n\n2. NonlinearCircuits Fourier (Output 2 / Cosine)\n\n3. ARP Odyssey (VCO 1, square wave)\n\n4. ARP Odyssey (VCO 2, square wave)\n\n5.

Inputs 6 and 7 ring modulated via Behringer 150, then sent into the 1006 Filtamp's second input and summed there. Final take recorded live in Goldwave with minimal post-proc work applied there.",

Synthesis Technology E352 Cloud Terrarium, Morph mode (2x Waldorf PPG wavetables, out 1) \n\n6. Synthesis Technology E352 Cloud Terrarium, Morph mode (2x Waldorf PPG wavetables, out 2)\n\n7. Expert Sleepers Disting Mk4, wavetable VCO (Unknown user wavetable)\n\n\n\nInputs 1 and 2 ring modulated via Behringer 150, then amped and slightly filtered via Doepfer A-121-3 low-pass filter and Buchla 292t quad lo-pass gate. Inputs 3 and 4 summed via Noise Engineering Xerest Pola mixer, then filtered via 2HP LPF and sent to Behringer 305 channel 2, almost mono. Inputs 5 and 6 attenuated via Doepfer A-135-2 mixer, with input 5 joining inputs 1 and 2 in the Buchla 292t, which was summed and routed through Strymon Magneto, with hard-panned L/R outs in Behringer 305. Input 6 sent from Doepfer A-135-2 to Behringer 1006 Filtamp, then Behringer 305 channel 1, almost mono. Input 7 filtered first via Behringer 1047 LPF resonator, then Buchla 292t.",

      "about": "Beginning in 2020, as the global pandemic surrounded us like an oppressive cloak, I developed a series of variations that would run in parallel with the Workingman's Drone series - then in its third year, which abandoned the first two years' format of twenty-minute pieces issued monthly in favor of pieces that ran for a full hour, sometimes even two or three. When the year came to a close, and I was collecting all twelve of those overgrown sessions, I was curious about how those longer pieces would sound if I reprocessed them to fit the original format of at (or around) twenty minutes each. \n\n\n\nThe Microdot Transmissions then followed - transfigurations of the source sessions, treated irreverently in an attempt to distill something new from the eroded core that remained. I employed all sorts of unique synthesis and mixing methodologies, such as fast Fourier transforms, stereo differences and mid-side equalization, as well as the gain saturations, compressors and parametric profiles of various machines in my collection. Following the fruitful output of these process-driven sessions, I also returned to the first two years of Workingman's releases and applied the inverse logic - elongating their twenty-minute runtimes into deeper and more cosmic worlds of sound - and these were subsequently issued across eight volumes as the Microdot Diffusions, apart from these Transmissions. \n\n\n\nAs the Workingman's Drone series continued into modular asceticism and held-tone compositions, the Microdot Transmissions followed in their own logical path, becoming a sort of dark timeline version of the Workingman's explorations. Where Workingman's was imagistically meditating on parts of the natural world, historical events and prosaic purpose, Microdot would keep its secrets - clandestine, forsaken, paranoid, self-isolated, disconnected and offline. These were afterimages of soundwaves that lingered in the dim air long after the machines that pushed themselves through the atmosphere had broken down - strange vessels made stranger by remaining bereft of any outward meaning or intent, emptied of their original purposes. Hollowed echoes blown in the last gasping wind of a dark landscape. \n\n\n\nSo here we are once again, finding ourselves apart and together, as we always are, and I'm left trying to explain the things I've done, always feeling utterly insufficient in my attempts. I've now completed a fourth year of Microdot Transmissions, and although this is by no means the last one, it felt important enough to collect everything that has so far been recorded and arrange it together into this eighteen-disc monolith, which I have augmented with two additional discs of extensions recorded under my Limestone Ziggurat alias. All fifty pieces are offered here for an incredibly low price - $4.44 each, or $66.66 for the full set, which brings the individual price of each piece down to under $2 - and I've reinstated all four sets in \"nice price\" editions that should make it easy for more people to explore it.",

      "about": "Now in its seventh year of development, Workingman's Drone remains, for me, more than yet another series in a catalog full of them. It stands apart from many of my other avenues of creative work in that the recordings function as equal parts proof of process and holistic utility, with WD sessions continually exploring the shape and depth of what is possible with synthesis, while also adhering to an ascetic ethos of building things that are as far-removed from the ego as these hardwares and softwares allow. \n\n\n\nIn a prosaic sense, each session is a momentary mirror of my subconscious, a minimalistic portrait of the artist held suspended in time, in a landscape populated with memories, temperatures and textures rather than colors and topical emotions. Workingman's music is less music than it is meditation, and since the original seeds were planted in 2010, it has paradoxically grown and reduced itself at the same time. \n\n\n\nThe first two years saw the series consist of twenty-minute pieces, much more composed and plotted out, exercises in genre and style using any tools I had available at that time. Then, after a pause, the third and fourth years issued excessively longer sessions - single-voice or single-machine explorations, often recorded extremely loud in my basement studio through gained-up amplifiers, built more out of physical feel and sensory-overload psychedelia.\n\n\n\nThe \"third phase\" of Workingman's Drone then arrived with the fifth and sixth (and now the currently running seventh) years of the series, with my winding path of building and learning an ever-growing modular system providing the navigation through fifty-five minute and fifty-five second long \"held tone\" compositions, consisting of any combination imaginable of different voices within my now expansive modular system, as well as further explorations of the \"in the box\" hardware rigged up in my basement. \n\n\n\nThese pieces were both more and less detailed than the prior iterations of the series, integrating a wider array of sources than the single-voice studies, but presenting those variations within an extremely strict and pre-determined framework that had more in common with Rothko or Mondrian than other musicians working in the self-professed drone world. \n\n\n\nThe themes running through the titling conventions for the series had also changed, shifting toward named references to unique locations, events or structures from around the world that had long fascinated me - natural wonders like waterfalls and cenotes, aged ruins, temples and shipwrecks, and monolithic buildings filled with secrets in the modern age. These were introduced to act as a writing prompt for the session itself, which was always tuned by ear, with no regard for predetermined chordal conventions, moods or textures, preferring instead to \"find\" my way toward these things inside the sound, eventually being carried there as if I were on a river. \n\n\n\nPerhaps that is how these pieces might feel to you, hearing them now, all lined up like tributaries on an impossibly large map. Whether you can find your way to these places through the soundwaves alone is not really important, but rather, that the soundwaves remain able to carry you *anywhere* besides where you began is the hopeful intent. Displacement of time and space through manipulated perspective has long compelled creatives like myself through the centuries toward some of my favorite things human beings have built, and the older I become, the more satisfying it seems for me to be able to build things like this for myself, following a path and still losing myself along the way, but always returning, as Eno beautifully said, to wonder what it might have meant, to consider what it could mean now as I push my hands into this river again and again.",

Both utilized programs that generate LFOs at specific numerically input frequencies, with variable waveforms, and with different divisible relationships to one another. All six LFOs were brought well into the audible range, and filtered differently. Tones 1/2 were filtered via the Behringer 1006 Filtamp (a reiteration of the ARP 2500 low-pass filter), tone 3 was filtered via a low-pass filter in the Expert Sleepers Disting Mk4 (algorithm D5), tone 4 was filtered via a 2HP low-pass filter, and tones 5/6 were filtered via a Doepfer A-121-3 band-pass filter. Tones 1/2 were panned hard left, 3/4 were panned hard right, and 5/6 remained mono/centered in the Behringer 305 mixer, and routed through a Zoom H1 and relayed to Goldwave. Minimal post-session editing was used, primarily some parametric equalization to clean up high-frequency noise and midrange hum, and fades were applied to the ends."

The wavetable itself is a custom table constructed from a sample of my daughter's speech, and is playing three notes from the Dorian scale.

      "about": "The practically named \"Eighteen Oscillators\" consists of two unique pieces that emerged from the sixty-third Workingman's Drone session with the Roland Juno 106 polyphonic synthesizer. The Juno 106 possesses six voices of polyphony, which all share the same amp and filter paths, as well as the same modulation sources, but despite these limitations the Juno remains one of the most articulate synthesizers I've ever had the pleasure to interact with. A line of gratitude is perpetually owed here to my friend Ross, who graciously made the Juno a part of my studio a few years ago, where my creative work has not really remained the same ever since it arrived.\n\n\n\nThree different takes of six-note chords were recorded for the session that later became released as \"Six Held Tones for the Great Blue Hole\" - a reference to the massive marine sinkhole near the Lighthouse Reef in Belize - with the final released take consisting of three E keys and three B keys. Following this, I wanted to explore a post-processing path that combined all three six-note chords into an even more harmonically rich wall of sound, and the two offerings published here are the results of two such attempts to do this. Both pieces were built using all three chordal structures, albeit using very different shaping processes, but I couldn't decide which one I preferred more, so they are both here - two sides of the same thought. \n\n\n\nWorking with the Juno, even in a post-processing capacity, is always a profound experience for me. Few other machines possess the same ability to be re-shaped and re-mined for new riches, and for this fact, I owe my friend Ross more than words can ever articulate. \"Eighteen Oscillators\" is a sort of statement piece of where I've been, where I am, in my creative work, which hasn't really happened very often in works published under my birthname anymore. Most of the time, those releases are serialized studies like Workingman's Drone or Microdot Transmissions, but every now and then, something materializes and I realize that I once again have an experience that I can draw a frame around. \"Eighteen Oscillators\" is also, however, bereft of any real ego or personal investment - what I wish to convey is, as always, held within the sound. All work is never finished. The statue remains inside the stone.",

      "about": "The Workingman's Drone series continues, changes, stays the same, and as I sit here watching the snow fall outside, held safely inside my wooden studio, considering the natural world as I often do while I write or patch or design, I once again feel that this ritual of ascetic minimalism is not a wall between myself and that world, but a communion with it.\n\n\n\nI considered taking a year off from Workingman's, having run it continuously each month since 2021 when it resumed with Year Four, but the recent studio additions of powerful wavetable synthesizers, as well as multiple machines with re-flashable firmware options, led me to feel that there was still plenty of richness to be found in the series' current trajectory.\n\n\n\nYear Seven follows the last two years of \"Held Tones\" sessions while also shifting its focus away from disparate points of interest around the world (either locations, events or structures that have fascinated me) as its writing prompts, and returning to the \"roots\" of Workingman's Drone, so to speak, with direct connections to trees. The series began with a simple visual indicator of two fir trees, which through the years would grow in size, and expand in number, until Year Five replaced terrestrial flora with imagined (perhaps cosmic) flora, sampled from the inexplicable Voynich Manuscript. So, while Year Seven continues this visual tradition of sampling from that source, the twelve writing prompts now reference twelve of the oldest living trees in the world, which bear individual names, and hold deep historical connections with their surroundings.\n\n\n\nThematic directions aside, the music offered here is identical in approach to Years Five and Six of Workingman's - a fixed number of voices, be they oscillators, LFOs, self-oscillating filters, noise generators, really any sound generator that can sustain a single tone, tuned by ear, panned and mixed accordingly. Year Seven will explore a system of seven tones, likely to be in a combination of mono and stereo, but always balanced and symmetrical, and designed to remain untouched for the duration of the recording.\n\n\n\nFrom here, to another year of composing by way of listening, to another year of seeking stillness in that most paradoxical realm of oscillation, another year of stepping away and listening instead of speaking, always returning to the Earth, always becoming the world instead of outrunning it.\n\n\n\n--- \n\n\n\nJuly's seven held tones are: \n\n\n\n1. Ornament & Crime (Squares and Circles, waveforms suite, reed voice, out 1)\n\n2. Ornament & Crime (Squares and Circles, waveforms suite, flute voice, out 2)\n\n3.

      "about": "For the fourth generation of the Microdot Transmissions, a completely new (but still similar to prior iterations) methodology was developed in order to reprocess all twelve held-tone compositions from Year Six of the Workingman's Drone series.\n\n\n\nThe Microdot variations have always been focused on \"defacing\" the source sound in an irreverent way - usually boiling out fidelity with stereo differences and fast Fourier transforms, and distilling new chordal shapes out of the dissolved remains - and this time, that dissolution was accomplished by applying various granular resampling tools typically used in my Deep Earth and Vibratelepathos session work, as well as digital effects processes that mirror those in my Limestone Ziggurat recordings.\n\n\n\nOnce all twelve sessions were rearranged at the molecular level, they were each brought into a DAW and given four multed iterations of themselves, each assigned to a specific placement in the stereo field - hard left, 10:00, 2:00 and hard right - and each iteration's pitch was reoriented purely by ear, without quantization, in order to arrive at this novel plateau. Following this arrangement, each iteration was processed with subtle tape fluttering and filtering, as well as a master buss processor from Airwindows that simulates the textural and timbral characteristics of a sound when heard from several miles/kilometers away. All of these variables shifted and changed from track to track, allowing for a push and pull where and when it was necessary for the music itself to come into an alignment that felt coherent. \n\n\n\nIn the end, the twelve pieces set before you hopefully only resemble their Workingman's session provenance in less obvious ways, and instead offer unique new perspectives on those compositions, perhaps from across an ambiguous landscape with overcast skies and low visibility. Somewhere further away, there is a storm rolling out of the sky, blocking out the sun, but in this moment, where we are able to quietly observe it from a safe and comfortable distance, it is simply a beautiful dark spectacle. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the 4xCD-R set - a revamped packaging design that places the four discs in individual cardstock jackets, held inside a clear plastic resealable sleeve, allowing it to ship more safely/affordably and be sold at a lower \"nice price\" - there is a special edition 20xCD-R dustproof ring binder set that collects all four volumes of Microdot Transmissions across eighteen discs, plus a two-disc epilogue of Limestone Ziggurat extended versions. All three prior Transmissions sets have been also given the matching \"nice price\" packaging treatment, making it easier for everyone to fill in their collections regardless of what's missing.",

      "about": "The Workingman's Drone series continues, changes, stays the same, and as I sit here watching the snow fall outside, held safely inside my wooden studio, considering the natural world as I often do while I write or patch or design, I once again feel that this ritual of ascetic minimalism is not a wall between myself and that world, but a communion with it.\n\n\n\nI considered taking a year off from Workingman's, having run it continuously each month since 2021 when it resumed with Year Four, but the recent studio additions of powerful wavetable synthesizers, as well as multiple machines with re-flashable firmware options, led me to feel that there was still plenty of richness to be found in the series' current trajectory.\n\n\n\nYear Seven follows the last two years of \"Held Tones\" sessions while also shifting its focus away from disparate points of interest around the world (either locations, events or structures that have fascinated me) as its writing prompts, and returning to the \"roots\" of Workingman's Drone, so to speak, with direct connections to trees. The series began with a simple visual indicator of two fir trees, which through the years would grow in size, and expand in number, until Year Five replaced terrestrial flora with imagined (perhaps cosmic) flora, sampled from the inexplicable Voynich Manuscript. So, while Year Seven continues this visual tradition of sampling from that source, the twelve writing prompts now reference twelve of the oldest living trees in the world, which bear individual names, and hold deep historical connections with their surroundings.\n\n\n\nThematic directions aside, the music offered here is identical in approach to Years Five and Six of Workingman's - a fixed number of voices, be they oscillators, LFOs, self-oscillating filters, noise generators, really any sound generator that can sustain a single tone, tuned by ear, panned and mixed accordingly. Year Seven will explore a system of seven tones, likely to be in a combination of mono and stereo, but always balanced and symmetrical, and designed to remain untouched for the duration of the recording.\n\n\n\nFrom here, to another year of composing by way of listening, to another year of seeking stillness in that most paradoxical realm of oscillation, another year of stepping away and listening instead of speaking, always returning to the Earth, always becoming the world instead of outrunning it.\n\n\n\n---\n\nApril's 7 held tones are: \n\n\n\n1. Waldorf NW1 (Text-to-speech wavetable)\n\n2. Synthesis Technology E352 Cloud Terrarium, Morph mode (2x Waldorf PPG wavetables, out 1) \n\n3. Synthesis Technology E352 Cloud Terrarium, Morph mode (2x Waldorf PPG wavetables, out 2)\n\n4. Behringer Model D (Oscillator 1, triangle wave)\n\n5. Behringer Model D (Oscillator 2, triangle wave)\n\n6. Behringer Model D (Oscillator 3, triangle wave)\n\n7. Behringer Model D (Low-frequency oscillator, triangle wave)\n\n\n\nInput 1 filtered via Arturia Minifilter LPF and centered to mono. Inputs 2/3 filtered via Arturia Minifilter LPF and hard panned L/R. Inputs 4-7 filtered via Doepfer A-121-3 LPF and converted to stereo image via Strymon Magneto, with outputs hard panned L/R.

      "about": "Following immediately on the heels of Year Five, Workingman's Drone returns with Year Six, carrying twelve more monthly volumes of sustained tone music. Adhering to the same format as Year Five, with a dedicated focus on unchanging 'held tones' for the duration of each session, 2023's recordings consist of six different sound sources - oscillators, feedback, granular synthesizers, etc - all tuned and panned by ear for each piece.\n\n\n\nDue to the temperamental nature of analog tools, oscillators will sometimes drift slowly across the piece's runtime, allowing factors such as temperature and electrical current fluctuations to affect the music in real time, and these drifts have been left intact on Workingman's Drone releases in order to capitalize on the unique sensations that become possible with glacial pitch deviations in a dense stereo field. The resultant recordings are minimally equalized and compressed for mastering and final release, and offer a view of the endless in their hypnotic shimmering walls of polyphony.\n\n\n\nWorkingman's Drone has always paired well with psychedelics, meditation, sleep deprivation and other forms of deep listening, and listener experimentation is always encouraged. Differences in stereo systems, volume levels, bass output and closed ear/open air playback will yield many new sonic experiences, highlighting my interest in producing music that is as much a utility as it is composition.\n\n\n\nAdjacent recordings to Workingman's sessions are often captured and issued as Limestone Ziggurat/LSZ releases, and may also appeal to listeners seeking to explore more sound material in this vein:  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n As with Year Five, Year Six's titles refer topically to various locations, events and other esoteric subjects that exist only as a possible writing prompt for each session. These subjects are in no way shape or form meant to be endorsed or advertised by the recordings, and should be considered in pure aesthetic terms only. Additionally, each session is published with one or more dedications to artists, writers, scientists and other creative minds that share a date of birth with the month of the recording. These people have all, in one or several ways, influenced my own endeavors and so it is my desire to thank them here, where and when I can.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nPATCH NOTES (2023/09/13)\n\n\n\nAugust's six held tones are:\n\n\n\n1.

Differences in stereo systems, volume levels, bass output and closed ear/open air playback will yield many new sonic experiences, highlighting my interest in producing music that is as much a utility as it is composition.\n\n\n\nAdjacent recordings to Workingman's sessions are often captured and issued as Limestone Ziggurat/LSZ releases, and may also appeal to listeners seeking to explore more sound material in this vein:  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n As with Year Five, Year Six's titles refer topically to various locations, events and other esoteric subjects that exist only as a possible writing prompt for each session. These subjects are in no way shape or form meant to be endorsed or advertised by the recordings, and should be considered in pure aesthetic terms only. Additionally, each session is published with one or more dedications to artists, writers, scientists and other creative minds that share a date of birth with the month of the recording. These people have all, in one or several ways, influenced my own endeavors and so it is my desire to thank them here, where and when I can.\n\n\n\n------\n\n\n\nPATCH NOTES (2023/10/20)\n\n\n\nOctober's six held tones are: \n\n\n\n1. Behringer Solina (Novel waveform)\n\n2. Behringer Solina (Novel waveform)\n\n3. Behringer Solina (Novel waveform)\n\n4. Behringer Solina (Novel waveform)\n\n5. Behringer Solina (Novel waveform)\n\n6. Behringer Solina (Novel waveform)\n\n\n\nUsing six held keys on an Arturia Keystep Pro keyboard controller, these six held tones each consist of Behringer's recreation of ARP's Solina String-Ensemble synthesizer playing with all six possible voices activated (contrabass, cello, viola, violin, trumpet, horn). For clarity of tone, the chorus and phaser effects remained unactivated, and instead the signal was multed and split between two low-pass filters (2HP LPF and Doepfer A-121-3) which were subtly modulated in frequency by a positive/negative sinewave LFO from a Behringer 140, before being routed through a Noise Engineering Versio (running the Lo-Fi setting in the Multi Versio firmware) in order to subtly vary the pitch deviation and further color the sound using a vactrol filter. In post, the resultant drone was processed via Arturia's JUN-6 chorus, based on the bucket-brigade chorus in the Roland Juno 106, alongside some basic parametric equalization.",

      "about": "'Coruscation' was originally recorded as far back as June 26th of 2022, as an initial session for a possible twenty-four month series which has since continued to gestate, and now exists apart from this recording. After months away from it, revisiting it in a new light allowed for a number of new contexts and possible perspectives to be applied, which have now carried it here. \n\n\n\n'Coruscation' was constructed using a custom wavetable, derived from a sample of ground hum in the White Pillar basement studio, played through the Arturia Microfreak with a host of onboard modulation and filtering tools, before being routed through the R-EW modular system for subsequent effects processing and stereo mixing. \n\n\n\n'Coruscation' is a lonesome lighthouse tower, visible from ships many miles out at sea. It fills the air, and the lungs, with a sun-like warmth, and migrates those held in its thrall back to shore, called home by a strange morning star that attracts forlorn explorers who have lost their way.",

      "about": "The Workingman's Drone series continues, changes, stays the same, and as I sit here watching the snow fall outside, held safely inside my wooden studio, considering the natural world as I often do while I write or patch or design, I once again feel that this ritual of ascetic minimalism is not a wall between myself and that world, but a communion with it. \n\n\n\nI considered taking a year off from Workingman's, having run it continuously each month since 2021 when it resumed with Year Four, but the recent studio additions of powerful wavetable synthesizers, as well as multiple machines with re-flashable firmware options, led me to feel that there was still plenty of richness to be found in the series' current trajectory. \n\n\n\nYear Seven follows the last two years of \"Held Tones\" sessions while also shifting its focus away from disparate points of interest around the world (either locations, events or structures that have fascinated me) as its writing prompts, and returning to the \"roots\" of Workingman's Drone, so to speak, with direct connections to trees. The series began with a simple visual indicator of two fir trees, which through the years would grow in size, and expand in number, until Year Five replaced terrestrial flora with imagined (perhaps cosmic) flora, sampled from the inexplicable Voynich Manuscript. So, while Year Seven continues this visual tradition of sampling from that source, the twelve writing prompts now reference twelve of the oldest living trees in the world, which bear individual names, and hold deep historical connections with their surroundings. \n\n\n\nThematic directions aside, the music offered here is identical in approach to Years Five and Six of Workingman's - a fixed number of voices, be they oscillators, LFOs, self-oscillating filters, noise generators, really any sound generator that can sustain a single tone, tuned by ear, panned and mixed accordingly. Year Seven will explore a system of seven tones, likely to be in a combination of mono and stereo, but always balanced and symmetrical, and designed to remain untouched for the duration of the recording. \n\n\n\nFrom here, to another year of composing by way of listening, to another year of seeking stillness in that most paradoxical realm of oscillation, another year of stepping away and listening instead of speaking, always returning to the Earth, always becoming the world instead of outrunning it. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nJanuary's 7 held tones are: \n\n\n\n1. (Mono) Noise Reap Foundation, sinewave\n\n2. (L) Buchla 258t, oscillator 1\n\n3. (L) Bastl Noise Squared, squarewave\n\n4. (L) Behringer 921, squarewave\n\n5. (R) Buchla 258t, oscillator 2\n\n6. (R) Bastl Tea Kick, squarewave\n\n7. (R) Behringer 1004, ramp wave\n\n\n\nL/R inputs summed initially via Future Sound Systems MTX9A 9x9 active pin matrix.

      "about": "Venusian Canals was recorded at White Pillar, three days after my 38th birthday in 2021, and stashed away like a secret until now. It consists of two disc-length sessions, both exploring sustained electric guitar fog alongside sub-bass lines, in a way that recalls my method of working around 2007-2009, where I would often sit down with a Boss RC-20 looper and RV-3 reverb, my Westone Concorde I electric guitar and my Lowrey Magic Genie organ's pedal bass, and roll the tape on my Tascam 414 four-track tape machine. In those days, the bass work was designed as a rhythmic anchor and a tonal center for the improvisations I'd bend out of my guitar, and the effect of combining those two elements always seemed to feel like more than the sum of its parts to my ears. There was some kind of coalescing in between them, where either the guitar's overtones or the bass vibrations pushed everything into a beautiful shimmering stasis. Here, on Venusian Canals, I sought to revisit that sound and feeling, though the bass for the sessions was sequenced on an Arturia Microbrute, rather than my Lowrey, which had to be left behind on a street corner in Columbia, when I moved to Ohio in 2016. Why I stashed these sessions away, I don't quite know. They may have been intended for someone else, or some other subsequent studio plan, or simply saved for a rainy day. With the somewhat quick onset of Autumn this year, they came calling back to me again, warm blankets of hazy dram to wrap myself up within, a counterpoint that allows me to enjoy the cool air rather than avoid it, and so I offer them to you for this purpose, or any other. They belong to both of us now, carrying us wherever their winding canals may reach in the surrealistic and ever-expanding landscape of my creative work.",

Roland Juno 106 (B) \n\n\n\nThis session was as simple as the patch notes imply - the six-voice polyphony within the Roland Juno 106 synthesizer was employed across three different pitches each on the E and B keys, with the output subsequently routed into the Peavey FX2 mixing board. Three takes with different chordal profiles were recorded, with the remaining two takes not presented here likely to be issued after Year Six has completed. In post, the recording was treated with some parametric equalization, low-pass filtering via Arturia's recreation of a Moog ladder filter, some subtle plate reverberation on the send via Arturia's recreation of the EMT plate reverb, and just a hint of pitch modulation applied to the latter also. Fades implemented via a vactrol-like configuration.",

This was the second session undertaken with the Yanqui oscillator, a unique ascetic approach to synthesis, which is a single output with no variable options or controls, in a randomly selected tuning that can only be changed by soldering. As such, all five of the other oscillators used for this session were tuned according to the base pitch of the Yanqui.",

      "about": "Each month in 2022, the Workingman's Drone series issued a fifty-five minute and fifty-five second long recording illustrating a moment held in the air, a view of a precipice frozen in four dimensions. It continues the linear but forever mutable path of the previous four years of the series, focusing in this iteration on five distinct oscillators tuned, mixed and panned by ear, and left to be still, or drift apart, or coalesce back into the same harmony, or become a new harmony, for an hour. \n\n\n\nAnalog machines can be directed, as any instrument can, but unlike many other instruments, they can hide their movements in glacially slow gradations, and when these changes happen within runtime is decided only by each oscillator itself, manifesting like a ripple in the still water that is almost imperceptible.\n\n\n\nThe resultant sound that emanates from these five oscillators is often gently pulsing or wavering, pulling ever so slightly out of focus before returning to placid clarity. Each chord has been formed out of the ether using a location or an event as a kind of imagistic writing prompt, although how the chordal shape itself relates to these prompts is a matter of apparent synaesthesia that even I am not able to fully understand.\n\n\n\nThese sessions have been predominantly defined by the usage of my expanding R-EW Audioholistics modular system throughout the 2022 year, although some sessions were instead informed by non-modular hardware with multiple-oscillator capabilities, such as the Korg opsix (a digital six-operator FM synthesizer) and Behringer's reiteration of the \"Blue Marvin\" ARP 2600 monophonic analog synthesizer. Regardless of the tools used to arrive at a predetermined conclusion - five held tones, of any sound provenance, in any arrangement so long as it remains unchanged for the duration of the piece - the methodology and axioms involved in the process remain the same. \n\n\n\nOver the last three years, I have written and recorded a prolific amount of material that supports my interests in exploring drone music in a more ascetic fashion than many other musicians seem willing to, with much of the music put forth under the definition of \"drone\" instead being some form of ambient music or another. To my ears, drone music must remain as compositionally static and unchanged as possible - a task much easier described than executed, given the aforementioned nature of analog oscillators and their associated designs. \n\n\n\nThese twelve sessions perhaps only imply stillness, as nothing in the observable universe can ever remain completely still, although the act of sculpting such focused minimalistic work remains invigorating to me, not only for the meditative benefits of immersing oneself in a vibrational isolation tank, but for the philosophical considerations that inevitably come to light in the empty spaces left open, where the music no longer has anything else to say.",

      "about": "\"Tempo pulsos malfokusita\"\n\n\n\nTen years ago, in April of 2012, my wife and I welcomed our daughter into the world, and her arrival also meant the departure of much of my energy for several months. Having the vocation I've chosen meant that, despite my being drained to the point of mental and physical exhaustion, I still set aside time to go to work, and almost immediately, it was evident that my recording process would never be the same again. Train Line Triads was the first published release I completed after I became a father, and as such, it has held a special regard in my memories. After my daughter officially entered her first year of double digits this year, it came to mind that I ought to revisit the album, and so the recordings you see before you are the result of just such a process. \n\n\n\nTrain Line Triads functioned primarily on a very classically inspired electronic music premise - sampling field recordings of trains passing by our home, very early in the morning, when the world was still otherwise asleep, and building very layered collage works out of the material - and the sessions were further informed by a notable amount of sleep deprivation, which in my experience has always brought into focus certain frequencies, textures and contours in whatever music I'm working on. Temperature sensitivities are heightened considerably, and the speed of my thoughts becomes illustrated in the sloth-like pacing of my arrangements. There's something very synaesthetic that happens in that state, and I've never really known a better way to describe it, but Triads was recorded entirely within that mode. \n\n\n\nSo, revisiting it now, ten years later, in a different state, with a different studio filled with different tools, arguably as a different person, was a careful bit of work to approach - hence my not issuing this release until the last possible moment of the 2022 year. I knew that I did not wish to remaster or alter the original album in any way, it deserves its place as the document that it is, so instead I decided to transfigure the recordings themselves and reapply many of the same processes and ideas that I was employing a decade ago, but with my current workflow and methodology guiding my hand. This meant that I distilled down the original pieces into new tonal constructs, by way of granular resampling, fixed filter banks and Fast-Fourier Transforms, and then decorated those sounds with three different field recordings (from April, the week of my 39th birthday in May, and July of this year), working with many different numerical inputs on modulators, delay rates and any other manner of automated processing that reflected the anniversary being observed. \n\n\n\nI haven't really made an album like this in a very long time, and this did not really become evident to me until I was nearly finished with the work I set out to do. It feels faithful to the original Train Line Triads, but also distinctly Daytonian, perhaps offering an alternative possibility of what Train Line Triads may have been if it were conceived now, and not then. In the spirit of celebrating the 10th anniversary, I've also decided to offer a very limited edition of 2xCD-R sets, containing both the original Train Line Triads album and this Revisited album, back to back. Whether or not these two are further augmented by a third volume in 2032 remains to be seen, but for now (and now is all we ever really have) this accumulation of the past, reshaped forever into the present moment, is offered to you in the hopes that you find something profound within its pages just as I have.",

Silver Ornament (Quadraturia / 83.05hz)\n\n2. Silver Ornament (Quadraturia / 2/3 of 1)\n\n3. Silver Ornament (Quadraturia / Unity with 1)\n\n4. Silver Ornament (Quadraturia / 5/3 of 1)\n\n5. Black Ornament (Vector LFO / 140.01hz)\n\n6. Black Ornament (Vector LFO / 56.01hz)\n\n\n\nTwo different Ornament & Crime modules were used for this session - one running the standard firmware, and the other running the Hemispheres firmware. Both utilized programs that generate LFOs at specific numerically input frequencies, with variable waveforms, and with different divisible relationships to one another. All six LFOs were brought well into the audible range, and filtered differently. Tones 1/2 were filtered via the Behringer 1006 Filtamp (a reiteration of the ARP 2500 low-pass filter), tone 3 was filtered via a low-pass filter in the Expert Sleepers Disting Mk4 (algorithm D5), tone 4 was filtered via a 2HP low-pass filter, and tones 5/6 were filtered via a Doepfer A-121-3 band-pass filter. Tones 1/2 were panned hard left, 3/4 were panned hard right, and 5/6 remained mono/centered in the Behringer 305 mixer, and routed through a Zoom H1 and relayed to Goldwave. Minimal post-session editing was used, primarily some parametric equalization to clean up high-frequency noise and midrange hum, and fades were applied to the ends.",

Oscillator 6 was routed into a Doepfer A-121-3 band pass filter before being sent to the mixer, and panned almost completely right. Oscillators 1 and 2 were routed into themselves for frequency modulation, and oscillator 4 was processed via a Beep Boop Kontact gain circuit.",

      "about": "The third volume of Microdot Transmissions arrives, broadcast back into the ether from which it was accumulated and harvested. All twelve sessions of 2022's \"Five Held Tones\" series in Workingman's Drone have been composted using a specifically designed signal processing path, which includes fast Fourier transforms, plate reverb, vactrols, granular pitch deviation and an extensive amount of parametric equalization, all funneled through the analog veins of a JVC KD-A11 deck for the final gloss.\n\n\n\nBy definition, the Microdot Transmissions are intended to be peripheral to the Workingman's Drone series, offering a view of \"possible worlds\" that can be discovered if one dives deep enough into the halftones of these vibrating passages. Equally psychedelic and holistic, they are suitable for substance-led excursions, meditation and are a reliable companion for open windows, paperbacks and studio workspaces. Listeners are encouraged to experiment with volume levels, speaker type (open air versus closed ear) and spatial placement, as well as with equalization and pitch of the audio playback, in order to maximize the usefulness of the material.",

Arturia Microfreak / Custom wavetable oscillator (R)\n\n\n\nJune's session differs from the prior five sessions of the year in that it sweeps through filter and wavetable timbre modulation with a randomized sample and hold LFO running at an extremely slow rate (0.06 hz). While the chord held is a static structure compositionally, the voice shifts and changes over time depending on where the oscillator chooses to derive its timbral characteristics from within the wavetable. The wavetable itself is a custom table constructed from a sample of my daughter's speech, and is playing three notes from the Dorian scale. As the Microfreak is a four-note paraphonic instrument, six notes were made possible by recording three held notes for the duration, and in post-processing, reversing and inverting the entire session and overlaying both in the hard right and hard left channels of the stereo field. Slight alterations were made in post with parametric equalization, some filtering and compression, in order to maintain a constant level of volume throughout the piece.",

      "about": "Year Five of the Workingman's Drone series surfaces, immediately following a fourth year, offering twelve more monthly iterations of sustained-tone drone recordings for the 2022 calendar year.\n\n\n\nUnlike Years Three and Four, which focused on studying the voice of a single device or sound source each month, Year Five represents an amalgamation of the first two years of Workingman's (which utilized a wide array of combined sound sources, albeit in representations that moved beyond sustained-tone drone music, and simply conveyed ambient music) and Years Three and Four, which maintained a stricter approach to the drone format, never developing the tonality beyond a decided initial arrangement that was designed to remain in a state of recurrent (and operatively endless) oscillation.\n\n\n\nIn this way, Year Five embraces five different oscillators or sound sources for every session, each of them held continuously for exactly fifty-five minutes and fifty-five seconds.

Bastl Tea Kick (Twin-T Resonant Structure oscillator)\n\n2. Bastl Noise Squared (Square waveform)\n\n3. Doepfer A-196 Phase Locked Loop (Square waveform)\n\n4. Cre8audio Chips (VCO 1 / Combinatorial waveform)\n\n5. Behringer 921 (Pulse waveform) \n\n\n\nAll five tones were generated within the R-EW's \"runoff\" system consisting of two Cre8audio Niftycases bracketed together. Tones 1/2/5 were mixed via an SSDP Jade Series switch mixer, with tone 1 panned left and tones 2/5 panned right. Tones 3/4 were sent directly out of the Niftycases' line outputs. Both cases' outputs were then sent back to the R-EW \"main\" system, where they were each processed by a different resonant low-pass filter (2HP and Doepfer A-121-3), multed with a dry signal sent into a Behringer 305 stereo mixer, and a second signal routed through a Strymon Magneto for additional high-pass filtering, tape degradation, spring reverb and delay, before being sent into the 305 as well. This summed signal was recorded directly into a Zoom H1 digital recorder and minimally mastered with parametric equalization and compression within a DAW. If the listener wishes to find a theme present within WD51, it is intended to be \"communication.\"",

Behringer 921 (Sine wave)\n\n2. Behringer 921 (Triangle wave)\n\n3. Behringer 921 (Ramp wave)\n\n4. Behringer 921 (Square wave)\n\n5. SSDP Jade Series Phasr (Sine wave)\n\n\n\nThe Behringer 921 oscillator, a 1:1 reinstatement of the Moog System 55's oscillator (with pulsewidth modulation coming from a composite modulation array, by way of Buchla 281t and Future Sound Systems' pin matrix), has all four waveform outputs sent into a Doepfer A-135-2 voltage controlled mixer, where it is attenuated and split, to be sent into 2HP and Doepfer A-121-3 low-pass filters. These LPFs are modulated by a very slow sinewave LFO from a Behringer 150 - one positive and one negative - in order to pan the signal by slowly opening and closing each filter. The filter outputs are sent hard panned L/R into a Behringer 305 mixer. The A-121-3's notch and bandpass outputs are sent into Mutable Inst. Clouds as L/R signals, which probabilistically rearranges the signal from its internal sampler buffer, reverberates and filters it again, and this signal is sent into Strymon Magneto, where it is modulated and routed through a four-head tape delay system, and finally sent back to slightly L/R panned inputs on the Behringer 305 mixer. Piggybacking in on the 305's 3rd and 4th channels as a mono signal via stacked cables is the self-oscillating SSDP Jade Series Phasr, a low octave sine wave, providing an ample and stable bass foundation beneath the wavering 921 oscillator and its various signal permutations. Thematically, the pitch deviation and creeping sense of dissonance within the patch's 55 minute runtime is very much intended, given the nature of the Runit Dome and what it physically and ethically represents. In this way, WD55's title is more connected to the music in a direct way than in other sessions in Year Five.",

Disting Mk4 (Resonator)\n\n2. Wildfire Laboratories Sovereign (Phase-locked loop / DTMF)\n\n3. Mutable Inst. Rings (Karplus Strong)\n\n4. Tiptop Model 258t (Additive / Buchla)\n\n5. Tiptop Model 281t (Additive / Buchla) \n\n\n\nThe resonator mode in Disting is triggered once, then the trigger is removed, as the resonation will continue infinitely and behave like a tuned oscillator, although it is in actuality a resonant filter. Sovereign is a unique tuned oscillator and a signal processor that exists somewhere between ring modulation and phase-locked loop processing, built upon the dual-tone multifrequency tone decoder (used in telephone services), and further shapes the output with selective voltage starvation. Rings is processing pink noise (output from a Behringer 150) and tuning the output signal into something near-chordal. The Buchla dual-oscillator is sending oscillator 1, frequency modulated by oscillator 2 (although this oscillator's output is not heard), along with the prior three signals into Tiptop MISO for subsequent attenuation and summing into two combined signals. These were sent into 2HP and Doepfer A-121-3 low pass filters, then directly into a Behringer 305 for mixing and panning. Finally, two tuned envelopes from the Buchla 281t (brought into audio range) were sent from the quadrature outputs into Strymon Magneto for digital tape processing and gain saturation, sending the processed stereo panned delays into the Mutable Inst. Clouds (which samples and re-pitches Magneto's output at a higher octave, adding reverberation), with both the Strymon's dry output and Clouds' output sent into the Behringer 305. The 305's output was captured with a Zoom H1, and sent directly into the desktop where it was recorded by Goldwave. Minimal post processing was applied (parametric equalization and conservative compression) in a DAW before rendering and uploading.",

All five signals were sent initially through a Mackie ProFX8 mixer, with shelving equalization applied to the full mix, before being routed into a Peavey FX2 mixing desk for final parametric equalization and compression, as well as a multing of the Mackie signal being first inverted, then routed through a Danelectro Reel Echo delay unit, and finally sent through a slightly resonant high-pass filter.",

Blue Marvin ARP 2600 (VCO 1 / Pulse wave)\n\n2. Blue Marvin ARP 2600 (VCO 2 / Pulse wave)\n\n3. Blue Marvin ARP 2600 (VCO 3 / Pulse wave)\n\n4. Blue Marvin ARP 2600 (Ring modulator / 2x instances of sawtooth LFO in audible range)\n\n5. Blue Marvin ARP 2600 (Sawtooth LFO in audible range)\n\n\n\nAs the patch notes make obvious, this month's session originates entirely from within Behringer's reissue of the \"Blue Marvin\" version of the ARP 2600 analog synthesizer. Focusing primarily on three pulse waves that are tuned according to the fastest possible rate of the machine's internal LFO (which is just barely putting it into the audible range as a sawtooth oscillator). The LFO was then sent to the 1-input/3-output multiple, where mult 1 went dry into the VCA input, mult 2 went into the gain input set to x1000, then into the ring modulator, and mult 3 went into the +10v voltage processor and inverted, before being sent into the second input of the ring modulator. The three oscillators and the output of the ring modulator were mixed through the ARP's low pass filter, and alongside the VCA output of the dry LFO, were sent into the spring reverb tank that is built into the machine itself. A very small amount of pink noise was also added into the filter path, but isn't very audible in the final output signal.",

Korg Opsix (Operator 1 / Additive 1+4 waveform)\n\n2. Korg Opsix (Operator 2 / Additive Tri3 waveform)\n\n3. Korg Opsix (Operator 3 / Additive 1+2 waveform)\n\n4. Korg Opsix (Operator 4 / Additive 1+4 waveform)\n\n5. Korg Opsix (Operator 5 / Additive 1+2 waveform)\n\n\n\nHaving recently acquired a Korg Opsix altered FM synthesizer in May for my 39th birthday, it was an easy decision to consult with five of the six operators within the machine in order to construct June's five held tones. All five operators are additive waveforms, which for the most part imitate stops on an organ, and were individually tuned/detuned, given varying degrees of feedback via frequency modulation, and finally routed through the machine's internal effects array, which utilized the \"unison ensemble\" effect, a variation on a chorus effect that selectively detunes the sound and widens it artificially in a stereo field. The machine's BRF12 notch filter was also used on the signal path. From there, the signal was sent into my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, where it was processed by a 2HP time-domain pitch shifter, multed and sent to two different filters - a 2HP low pass filter, panned hard left, and a Doepfer A121-3 multimode filter, with the Doepfer's LPF output panned hard right, and the high/bandpass filter outputs panned slightly left and right, respectively. This output signal was routed into a Zoom H1, which conveyed it directly into Goldwave's recorder for subsequent DAW integration/final parametric equalization/compression/mastering.",

Ornament & Crime / Quadrature LFO (Novel waveform)\n\n2. Ornament & Crime / Quadrature LFO (Novel waveform)\n\n3. Ornament & Crime / Quadrature LFO (Novel waveform)\n\n4. Ornament & Crime / Quadrature LFO (Novel waveform)\n\n5. Behringer 150 / LFO (Triangle waveform)\n\n\n\nOne of the few ways to coax usable audio information out of Ornament & Crime (a multipurpose utility module that usually performs modulation and timing functions, as opposed to audio processing) is to bring the four low-frequency oscillators in the module's Quadraturia mode into audible frequency ranges. For the 58th session, I began by bringing another LFO into audible range - the Behringer 150 module, which is a recreation of a section of the Roland System 100 - and tuning the first of Ornament's LFOs alongside that. Quadraturia's method of LFO generation is such that LFOs 2/3/4 are each relative to the rate of LFO 1, by way of multiplications or divisions, and so all four were tuned to different pitches that formed a harmonic chord. LFOs 1/2 were sent into a 2HP low-pass filter, while LFOs 3/4 were sent into a Doepfer A-121-3 multimode filter, and these outputs were then routed into Strymon's Magneto module for four-head tape delay and hard L/R panning within a Behringer 305 mixer. The first LFO from the Behringer module was processed through a 2HP Pitch module for time-domain pitch shifted duophony, then filtered through a Disting Mk4, before being routed into Mutable Inst. Clouds, where it was probabilistically sampled, filtered and reverberated, with Clouds' outputs hard L/R panned into the 305 mixer.",

The Dreadbox Utopia LFO was routed into its own Pulserizer input - essentially a bit-crusher - which turned the audible-range sinewave LFO into a pointed waveform with more body, and alongside the SSDP Jade series VCO (using a novel waveform), these were summed and sent into a 2HP low-pass filter. Next, I unified the Bastl Tea Kick's squarewave output with the second more angular waveform oscillator within the Buchla 258t in the same fashion, sending those into a Doepfer A-121-3 low-pass filter. For the fifth signal, I used another squarewave, this time from Bastl's Noise Square, and shaped that via the low-pass filter mode in Expert Sleepers' Disting Mk4. I used the positive and negative outputs of a Behringer 150's LFO to sweep and pan the 2HP and Doepfer low-pass filters, before sending them L/R panned into a Behringer 305 stereo mixer. The signal from the Mk4 was sent into Strymon Magneto, where it was processed into stereo with a four-head tape delay, and also L/R panned in the 305 mixer.",

      "about": "Year Five of the Workingman's Drone series surfaces, immediately following a fourth year, offering twelve more monthly iterations of sustained-tone drone recordings for the 2022 calendar year.\n\n\n\nUnlike Years Three and Four, which focused on studying the voice of a single device or sound source each month, Year Five represents an amalgamation of the first two years of Workingman's (which utilized a wide array of combined sound sources, albeit in representations that moved beyond sustained-tone drone music, and simply conveyed ambient music) and Years Three and Four, which maintained a stricter approach to the drone format, never developing the tonality beyond a decided initial arrangement that was designed to remain in a state of recurrent (and operatively endless) oscillation.\n\n\n\nIn this way, Year Five embraces five different oscillators or sound sources for every session, each of them held continuously for exactly fifty-five minutes and fifty-five seconds. This approach allows for a wide range of sounds to be utilized, while still remaining adherent to the ethos that drone music should exist in a moment of stasis, as much as possible.\n\n\n\nApart from the numerical connections and relationships present within these sessions, listeners will note a series of specific locations or events referenced in the titles. These places and moments are only a focal point of fascination, through which I am able to reactively shape the timbral and textural characteristics of each session - essentially a 'writing prompt' for the creative act to start somewhere, as it always must. These titles are not dedications or statements of any kind, simply a sonic weltlandschaft to exist as a backdrop for the central subject matter - five tuned voices - in order to convey more profound perceptions of depth and wider ranges of visualization in the mind's eye.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nPATCH NOTES (2022/12/14)\n\n\n\nDecember's five held tones are:\n\n\n\n1. SSDP Jade series AS3340 novel waveform oscillator\n\n2. Behringer 1004 (ARP 2500) pulse wave oscillator\n\n3. Buchla 258t oscillator 1 (sine wave)\n\n4. Buchla 258t oscillator 2 (square wave)\n\n5. Buchla 245t sequential voltage source (pulse wave)\n\n\n\nTo begin, the 1004 pulse wave oscillator and the Buchla 258t (osc 2) were routed into a Behringer 1006 Filtamp module. The Buchla 245t, designed as a five-step sequencer, was repurposed into a pulse wave generator by tuning all five steps accordingly, and running the unit's internal clock almost as fast as it was able to go, producing a stable oscillator, which was routed into a 2HP lowpass filter. The first oscillator in the Buchla 258t was routed into a Doepfer A-121 bandpass filter. Finally, for the most complex waveform in the patch, the AS3340 VCO was multed and sent dry into the first input of a Behringer 1005 Modamp ring modulator, while a second iteration of the AS3340 was sent into a Beepboop Kontact gain circuit, then into a 2HP time-domain pitch shifter where it was retuned and sent into the second input of the Modamp. The Modamp's two inharmonic control voltage outputs were then used to as pitch input for the AS3340 and the 2HP pitch shifter, respectively, where the final sum signal of the Modamp was sent into a Disting Mk4 running the stereo tape delay mode. The Disting's output was equalized via the parametric equalizer within the Behringer 305 mixer, and added to the final mix. \n\n\n\nN.B. - Workingman's continues to yield rich crops of synthesized sound, and I am pleased to report that it will immediately continue with Year Six in January 2023, transforming accordingly into a series of Six Held Tones. A cumulative box set collecting all twelve sessions from Year Five will no doubt manifest sometime in 2023, although no date has yet been decided for this as of now. My deepest gratitude to everyone who has continued to listen and support the Workingman's Drone series - it remains one of my favorite concepts to return to, and has grown into something truly representative of my ever-growing and changing systems and tools. See you on the other side.",

      "about": "2020 was a strange year, and 2021 isn't shaping up to be much different. A worldwide pandemic, political unrest, suffering and death, systemic racism and continual climate change, among many other factors, added up to a lot of anxiety to live with each day, and that much more to unpack in bed each night as I tried to sleep. \n\n\n\nI don't mind admitting here that 2020 was also the year I returned to marijuana usage on a near-nightly basis. Those who know me personally can attest to the fact that from 2003-2020, I'd used the stuff less than five times total, all of them social in context (including when I was in Augsburg, Germany having an intense panic attack after my Milieu set was cut short from power supply problems, in front of so many other musicians I'd been influenced by - a perennial thanks to Gerald and Henry for helping me deal with all that). Additionally, no more than a single Coppice Halifax track was made while under the influence (a prize to anyone who can figure out which one), as I've always preferred to work sober, and still do. \n\n\n\nPrior to 2003, when I sold off my stash to a co-worker and \"cleaned up\", I'd been dependent on a number of substances and rituals in order to remain a functional member of adult society, which is a whole other book of stories and I don't want to get into that here. Suffice to say that I had a lot of reasons for relying on drugs, and a lot more for giving them all up, chiefly among them being my desire to move forward with my creative work, which I felt was being hindered by my dependencies. \n\n\n\nSo, the notion of bringing such things back into my life was not a decision I'd make lightly or in haste, but rather, I'd discuss it at great length beforehand with my family, my therapist and multiple MDs, arriving at the logical conclusion that a prescription for it was in my best interest, especially given my highly fluctuating self-employment situation and need for a non-chemical solution to alleviate stress, flexible enough to use as needed without hangovers, addictive properties or (like some pharmaceuticals) have to maintain a strict level of it within my system at all times for it to work. In this way, marijuana became more of an answer than a question, and unlike all those years prior, this time would be different. I'd be at liberty to use it in a non-toxic and fearless way, safely monitored by professionals, not hiding it from family and friends, not worried about \"getting busted\" or losing my job, and really able to get the most out of a plant that had been grown within my own state, to exacting specifications, unlike the \"who knows what it was\" stuff I'd grown up smoking. Gone also were the health risks with carcinogens, instead replaced by a portable convection vaporizer - easier on the lungs, and less wasteful of the actual herb too. \n\n\n\nIndeed, with all of these things now carefully considered, paid for and plotted out, it was hard not to be excited about the prospect of having a new and efficient way of alleviating my anxieties and worries, while also providing myself a \"hard reset\" on days when I just couldn't turn my brain off. Beyond this, I felt like a kid in an amusement park, being able to finally experience my large body of recordings as a passenger, with the THC acting as a crowbar of detached perspective, allowing me to hear many of my albums and songs as many of you do, apart from my own associations and memories that they are built from. It's probably been the one great thing about 2020, all told, and so it felt apt to document it in the same way I've always tried to, with recordings.\n\n\n\nThat is what you will find here, quite literally an audio logbook of my many evenings outside, slowly drawing vaporous euphoria through a pipe, feeling less and less consumed by the world around me as it seeped into my bloodstream, and more and more simply a part of it. I'd pick up my cellphone and turn on a digital recorder app, in this case a very strangely-behaving Dolby recorder (more on this later), and set it down beside me on either my front porch (under the titular White Pillars on the front of my home) or my back porch (a cozy wooden deck overlooking a steep overgrown ravine) and often times let the microphone pick up almost nothing at all. \n\n\n\nBy the end of each recording, I'd have traded tension for time-travel, while the wind and the distant traffic became long breathing patterns, the night itself being a grand body inhabited by all the little lights and orange house windows like cells and organs and veins. I have always appreciated listening to sounds from the outdoors, no matter how mundane - you may even recall a few of the Naked Sound releases that deified things like lawnmowers, air conditioners, windchimes and even an empty garage - and so Porch Hash Logbook follows in that tradition, in perfect step with my interests in elevating mere passing moments to some level of artistic worth, if only for my own safe keeping and remembering. \n\n\n\nImagine my delight then, when I brought these accumulated recordings into the studio for mastering and prepping for this release, and discovered that the Dolby software had applied some very strange processing to the sounds - some kind of special proprietary noise-cancelling and stereo-field-analyzing DSP stuff, with what appears to be some selective compression and EQ notch work as well - which manifests in the form of odd reverberations evoking room-like spaces (despite being outdoors) and smearing the sound of passing cars or planes into alien drones, that almost even sound like a vocoder. These mutations only add to the uniqueness of the recordings, for me, and even give me more ideas about what else I might be able to use them for in other studio work. \n\n\n\nIn the end, I've written a whole lot about something that isn't very detailed or substantial. It feels much more personal and intimate in many ways, perhaps even a little voyeuristic. Due to the onset of the Ohio Winter, I was forced to take my nightly ritual back indoors, but as of my writing this now, the weather is becoming more amenable and so a new round of porch recordings are likely to come. Given the Dolby processing \"happy accident\", I have some newer ideas about how to subtly affect the forthcoming recordings in other ways, and I'm looking forward to experimenting. \n\n\n\nI think the biggest reason for my doing all of this is simply that I am eager to prove to myself, tangibly, that my life is not nearly as hard or bad as it could be, especially with everything else happening in the world, and these recordings serve as reminders of this observation. Hopefully, at the end of all of this hysteria and pain, and seemingly endless wondering and waiting, you and I can meet up for some porch excursions of our own, share a few puffs over some coffee, and we can leave the microphone off, contentedly knowing that things are better than they were before.",

It is a marked attempt to be less than precious about what may be published in the public forum, as far as material commodity is concerned - an exercise in informality and spontaneity. Other similar projects have been drafted with this will in mind, and will soon surface, but for now, here is a milemarker in the rainsoaked Urth, witness to only an arbitrary section of time passing, the before just like the after...or will it be different?",

A post inscribed with the name of a king, or a metal edict left spare in the sand - it doesn't matter, and still we sink. Spitting and coughing, cursing the men who sent us here, their animosities still writ large upon the fractured landscape, smoke collapsing lungs, forced to imbibe from this doomed goblet, as we drift further down into the black.

      "about": "FROM THE LABEL, 2014: \"Blue Wheatfield is an ambient blues album, where guitar improvisation blurs the lines between drone music, psychedelia and pure modal sadness. Intended to be a specific part of an as-yet-unnamed canon within the Brian Grainger oeuvre, Wheatfield most resembles its Attacknine cousin from 2007, Eight Thousander. Looping passages of chords and tangled textures give slowly in to huge catacombs of spacious sound, and bedroom loneliness hangs over the impressionist creator like a black umbrella. In truth, the artist's imposed listening order would be Eight Thousander, Nine Billion Names, (the yet to be released) Summer's Parting Ways and finally Blue Wheatfield, meaning that what we're hearing is the end of something...unless yet another link in the chain exists in an unseen destination ahead. The pondering of this possibility or the perceived connection Wheatfield bears to any of Grainger's other works is ultimately pointless - Blue Wheatfield stands alone, swaying slowly beneath a full southern moon and a black oil sky, pricked with the wounds of nine billion names of God. One by one, the stars go out...\" \n\n\n\nFROM THE CASSETTE JACKET, 2014:\n\n\n\n\"It was a humid night like any other\n\nWhip-poor-wills, late in Summer\n\nThe young man arrived on dusty heel\n\nDismounted horse beside the field\n\nWheatgrass swayed beneath the wind\n\nThat blew through his dark bearded chin\n\n'O cold bones, I call for thee!'\n\nHe shouted off into the trees\n\nBut no one came and no one answered\n\nNo sound of steps or even laughter\n\nTurned around and reaching toward\n\nA bent guitar just like a sword\n\nOr some exotic talisman\n\nFrom a dream of far off lands\n\nA simple strum, the wheat responded\n\nA silent bow, as if departed\n\nThen his eyes raised, stopped his breath\n\nAnd now the young man greeted Death\"",

      "about": "Recorded in 2008, POROUS VARIATIONS represented a graduated approach to drone music that was informed by almost two years of working on similar improvisations and instrument-applications with David Tagg at Second Sun Recordings and INSTALL. It marked a fork in the path in many ways, the first of what would eventually be numerous recording sessions focused on sustained tones, bright timbres, bass subharmonics and rich chordal structures that resonated in an almost electrical sense. The feel and pacing of POROUS VARIATIONS is still today, twelve years later, representative of my deep interests in sustained-tone recordings, meditative harmonics and drone music that is both a raga-like meditation and a physical experience of vibration and shimmering electricities. \n\n\n\nAt the time, POROUS VARIATIONS was notable for the excessive length of some pieces, and the third-disc centerpiece \"Antediluvian\" was the then-longest single piece of music I'd ever recorded. The music was equally inspired by Eastern music for sitar and vocals, sub-tectonic chords on early Sunn O))) recordings and the guitar experimentalism of the New Zealand underground, as well as concurrent influences from David Tagg, Ophibre and Acre. In line with these approaches, the music was recorded live, each piece in a single improvised take, using only a Westone Concorde I electric guitar, a Lowrey \"Magic Genie\" organ, a slew of FX devices and multitrack cassette tape. By the time the more extended pieces manifested, I was modifying my own physical presence in the sessions by deliberately depriving myself of sleep for up to a full week at a time, which resulted in much more vivid and intense psychedelic experiences as I navigated my way through the sound by vibration alone, senses heightened and overly aware of changes in temperature and low frequencies alike. \n\n\n\nIt was in such a state that I conceived of the titles for the album, which representatively illustrated phosphene-like images that seemed to bloom in my mind, as the soundwaves buzzed warmly out of the studio amps. The title of the album itself seems to indicate a duality, the sensation of being composed of a material that is both itself and absorbed elements of its surroundings, a blending of will and the absence of it. Mirroring this notion, POROUS VARIATIONS was issued with two different sets of track titles, each set printed on half of the 3xCD-R pressing run. Canonically, these pieces favor the titles presented here, but in the interest of representing POROUS VARIATIONS accurately, the labeling on this reissue will reflect both track title sets.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, it was during these sessions that I arrived at \"The Analog Botanist\", which as many will know, went on to be utilized as my written credit for mastering and production roles, as well as the namesake of the first dub techno recordings by Coppice Halifax. In this original sense, \"The Analog Botanist\" referred less to fidelity and format, and more specifically to one who could be a gardener or cultivator of things that existed symmetrically and symbiotically, a maintenance person for liminal spaces and intimate relationships, an agent of balance and a refutation of the self as the center of the universe. Today, it feels appropriate to me that such a term would have originated on something that was a personal and inward exploration issued under my birthname. \n\n\n\nFor the occasion of reissuing this album, I've taken great care in remastering it here in the White Pillar Workshop, during a year that could be described as Hell on Earth, at best, and I don't mind admitting that my own work's escapist offerings have been more necessary and vital than ever for my own mental health in 2020. This already large triptych has been augmented by the presence of a fourth disc, containing an expansive Coppice Halifax transfiguration of \"Sequoian\" from side two, which seeks to connect the forestial source material with the oceanic fantasism of the Halifaxian world. The album has also been given a photographic cover image, for the first time, where the original edition only ever used monochromatic pattern designs. This new photograph slightly recalls an extremely slow-motion video for \"Sequoian\" that was published in 2008:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5Yf6gx7aho\n\n\n\n **NOTE: The CH remix has also been given a solo digital release, with more extensive notes written about the mix and a different variant on the cover photograph, so that listeners who are only interested in the new material do not need to buy this reissue set to obtain it:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/sea-leveler",

      "about": "With the arrival of Autumn, and especially this Autumn, signaling the end of a long and arduous Summer, it has not yet felt more appropriate to reinstate the brother-sister albums Diamond Tears On Slate and White Kingdoms, two monoliths of opposing textures and tonalities, intended as gatekeepers flanking the left and right sides of some great abyssal threshold. White Kingdoms, recorded first, was the more open-air, harmonic of the pair, in direct and almost clean contrast to Diamond Tears On Slate's dusky menace. Where DTOS would be more \"heavy metal\" guitar (as much as a drone album could be) and high-gravity organ work, Kingdoms used cascading sheets of white noise, tape hiss, and resonant harmonic lines to invoke the same drifting feeling I'd get listening to sitar music or Eliane Radigue. \n\n\n\nWhite Kingdoms was recorded in Summer of 2009, using only electric guitar, Lowrey organ and a Tascam four-track tape machine, in tandem with a lot of pedal FX and creative use of equalizers and compressors inside a Boss DR-880 drum machine, of all things. It was rehearsed for a bit more than the raw and noisier recordings that followed for Diamond Tears, perhaps illustrating that I wanted to draw a very careful and deliberate line around certain passages of white noise, low bass and harmonic drones. As such, the accompanying White Dust EP materialized from outtakes, and while preparing all of the masters for this reissue I even found two extended sessions, each filling the side of a tape, which offer more minimalistic and drawn out attempts at \"Plateau Phase\", albeit in more abstract and embryonic states. Additionally, I've chosen to include \"Plateau II\", which was recorded concurrently but left off of the album in order to preserve the then-ideal three track triptych. It was later released as a part of my twenty-four album Sun-Day series, on Sun-Day 3. \n\n\n\nThe album was offered to Sound & Fury in Australia, a small label that I'd admired for a number of their releases, and unfortunately, White Kingdoms became the final release at the imprint. It came and went, and now it's been 11 years since, and I feel these recordings are worth revisiting in a more formalized way again. Both Diamond Tears and White Kingdoms have always reminded me of Autumn, despite being recorded in the heat of Carolinian Summer - their crumbling towers of compression abuse and tape hiss always seem to anticipate and accentuate the browning and oranging of the leaves. In celebration of this re-assembled reissue, I've also drafted a deep somewhat Ocean Lion-resembling remix of \"Shimmering Skull Raga\", which closes out the three-disc set in a fitting White Pillar resolution.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Those who would prefer to purchase only the CH excavation may do so digitally at the CH Bandcamp page:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/an-extract-of-keystone-flowers",

      "about": "POURED OUT was originally commissioned by Txt in the UK (the same label that issued the first edition of Statuettes Part One and Metraliminaloxone) for inclusion on their expansive Nagual 5 quintuple-disc box set compilation. The Nagual 5 version was edited down to under 20 minutes and mastered by Txt's resident engineer, Blackparticle. Until now, the full and unabridged session recording has not been made public. Sonically, POURED OUT resembles the twelve single-voice drone sessions from 2018-2019's third leg of the Workingman's Drone series, and it follows the WD series' ethos almost to a fault. A single analog polyphonic synthesizer, sculpted and laid bare for almost eighty minutes, left to resonate and vibrate the air through the veins of a Roberts 450A reel to reel and a Peavey FX2 mixing desk, with several analog and digital outboard effects devices employed strategically. \n\n\n\nEXPLORE NAGUAL 5 HERE:  txtrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/nagual-5",

      "about": "YOU CAN'T HIDE SADNESS FROM STONE was a deep session undertaken in the Summer of 2018 using a Korg MS-20 and an Arturia Microbrute (both monophonic analog synthesizers) in conjunction with several small Moog FX units that were also sending/receiving control voltage modulation. The idea was approached after a friend planted the idea for an ambient music live event somewhere in the rural midwest, and the session was a sporadic proof of concept for what such a live performance from me might take the form of. The recording ended up running a full two hours, a precursor to some of the Workingman's Drone sessions that would follow by the end of that year, and the focal point of the session was tuning the oscillator voices alongside three resonant low-pass filters and routing slow modulation envelopes to all of them to allow for a continually shifting sea of voices. Additionally, the pitch of each voice was designated in the lower octaves, making the mass of the piece only fully perceived through larger speaker systems with a greater constitution for low frequency output. Since that time, the piece has lain dormant on a hard drive, as the decision was made to wait on issuing it until after the Workingman's Drone series was no longer active, lest it become overlooked and underappreciated in the process. It arrives here and now, at the end of a long, long Summer - perhaps the longest Summer in many years, for a lot of us. The irony of this piece being drafted with live performance in mind is also bittersweet, and it is my sincere hope that we can all be together again soon to explore experiences like this one in the same space. Until then, be safe and be well. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Designed for either very quiet or very loud playback - headphones or subwoofers are recommended. Due to the length of the original piece far surpassing the runtime limits of compact discs, a special composite mix has been created for the CD-R edition, which is slightly louder than the full version and can be utilized in more discrete listening environments because of this.",

      "about": "Silver Horns was recorded during a very hot Spring & Summer in Columbia, South Carolina, 2010. It feels now more distant in the past than it actually is, somehow, and perhaps that is a testament to the sense of disconnection present throughout many of this double-album's pieces. Assembled from two or three sessions of guitar improvisation, with a few tracks using a Lowrey organ for additional harmonic support or pedal bass, it was issued in a limited run of 100 silver tin boxes at Lunar Testing Lab's excellent Secret Station imprint, and has since been out of print. Deep, green and pastoral music, for wide-frame country vistas like the one I photographed on the cover, which brings to mind images of warm sunshowers, wild forestry and rolling hills of farmland. A very elemental record that is less music in parts and more atmospheric condition, supported by two hours of deep-country field recordings captured at my father's home in Loris, South Carolina. In addition to the original double-album being reinstated here, I've included a third disc, which contains \"Dustwreck\" (a digital-only promo piece given to patrons who bought the Secret Station edition) and a recently recorded 51-minute Coppice Halifax \"excavation\" of \"Blue Country Rain\", built using the original session tapes (back when the album was in a more embryonic form, bearing a totally different title). While this 3xCD-R reissue is not quite as lavish as the silver tin box the album was originally released in, I feel that this version makes up for it in completeness.",

      "about": "THE PLUCKED SEED is a four-part, twenty-eight track album, privately commissioned by Finnish painter Anni Roenkae in February, 2020. Work began that Spring, just as the pandemic was beginning to happen, and was not completed until May of 2021. It was designed as a musical score for a text reading of a vivid and heavily symbolic dream Anni experienced, which she has been developing separately as a screenplay and a comic book as well:  www.anniroenkae.com\n\n\n\n As it often goes with my work, what I set out to do initially ends up resembling the final recordings very little, even though THE PLUCKED SEED was rigidly built using a very on-paper system of reference points, textural and musical themes and conceptual motifs. It could be interpreted as a spiritual follow-up to my previous soundtrack-without-a-body, THE ENDLESS SLEEP, and functions much in the same way as that album did for a film that was tragically destroyed before it was ever finished. Anni, for her part in commissioning this work, allowed me complete creative freedom to explore her surreal ideas, and as a result, THE PLUCKED SEED was an organic and subconscious manifestation that grew outward from her prompts. It would not exist without her influence or initiation, and yet, it feels very referential to many other recordings I've published under my birthname, and as Milieu and Coppice Halifax also. \n\n\n\nTHE PLUCKED SEED is sonically unique in that it used nearly every instrument and sound-machine in my studio at some point in the process of its creation. The list of synthesizers, effects processors, drum machines, electric and acoustic guitars and other strange sound sources would be even longer than the album itself. It is a multifaceted example of the studio itself being used as a tool, and probably the closest example of what a Grainger soundtrack for a feature-length film might look or sound like. The recordings were also made alongside my ongoing construction of a modular synthesizer system, throughout the 2020-2021 year, and many of the pieces reflect that approach to sound design and musical ideas overlapping in unexpected or unusual ways. \n\n\n\nWhether the listener chooses to dig deeper into Anni's comic book while listening, attempting to find the narrative points connecting the music to the story, or if they simply let the music itself speak to them without a companion text or image for context, THE PLUCKED SEED is designed as a deeply detailed and immersive listening experience, with many peaks and valleys, heavenly highs and abyssal lows - a trip not taken lightly or without some preparation, which may not be for many of my longtime listeners. For those of you reading this who have been enthralled by my experimental work, made progressively more curious about what could happen next, given all the length of time and space my work has travelled, THE PLUCKED SEED offers a psychedelic and surrealistic world to explore, filled with natural beauty and unnatural doom, a living pulsing tapestry of subconscious expression, thematic improvisation, generative synthesis and dream-state symbolism.",

      "about": "Originally material conceived for an abandoned split release with another artist, Autumn Soil Feedback is a unique and texturally rich experimental album, putting tonal drones and musical elements into the background and bringing crunchy, synthetic and organic foliage to the fore. Released in two prior editions of 50 copies each, both of them long since extinct, with the earliest pressing now five years old. As with the Brother reissue, I've decided to return to the source material not only for remastering and reissuing, but also for recontextualizing. This expanded edition of A.S.F. includes a deep half-hour Coppice Halifax \"excavation\" of the original sound, using the four-track session tapes in conjunction with the Botany Bay studio assembly, mining source material for new richness alongside drum machines and pools of FX. The result is a monolithic mass of Autumnal organics that is equal parts techno, drone and compost. The remastering of the original five tracks was also done comprehensively with analog systems, to bring even more of the texture and warmth out of the original recordings. If you close your eyes, you can almost smell the burning leaves and cinnamon.",

      "about": "With the arrival of Autumn, and especially this Autumn, signaling the end of a long and arduous Summer, it has not yet felt more appropriate to reinstate the brother-sister albums Diamond Tears On Slate and White Kingdoms, two monoliths of opposing textures and tonalities, intended as gatekeepers flanking the left and right sides of some great abyssal threshold. Diamond Tears On Slate, as the name implies, was the darker of the two, but not maudlin or depressive darkness, but shadowy, overgrown and dense darkness, forestial and feral darkness, primordial and mammoth. \n\n\n\nOriginally recorded in the Summer of 2009, then released in October 2010 at the now-defunct UK label Dead Pilot, DTOS was laid to four-track using electric guitars, Lowrey organ and, to some extent, the processing of the tape itself as voice. I'd been absorbing things like Birchville Cat Motel, Omit, Sunn O))) and Ophibre for some time by then, and my INSTALL imprint with David Tagg was still in full-swing, so DTOS very much feels emblematic of that moment in time, when noisy bedroom droning and guitar experimentalism were still the laws of the land, and there was still some kind of a circuit that albums like this could run, between the bloggers and bootleggers circulating and discussing it, the distributors and record stores stocking it and the labels that could eke out an existence publishing it. Many of those things are absent now, moved on from in one way or another, but Diamond Tears remains, solid and resolute as ever, like a pyramid blasted for years by desert sand and sunburnt wind - it looks on, silent in a landscape, sometimes buried, sometimes unearthed, forever waiting for another traveler to discover it. \n\n\n\nFor this occasion, which is actually the 10th anniversary of the album's original pressing, almost down to the day, I have reassembled the original five tracks, plus a second disc collecting the two original tape sessions of the title track and \"Empyrean Crown\" (both of which were issued as one of two different bonus 3\" CD-Rs with certain faux-obi-stripped copies of DTOS, later reissued digitally as EC/DT), augmented by a new Coppice Halifax dub of LP-closer \"Pagan Horn\", which transmutes the source material through the veins of a few old samplers and projects it into the hot air floating above Lake Busbee and the old Dolphus M. Grainger generator station, themselves now just a distant memory, vanished and vaporized. Some confusion may also be possible, as the original Dead Pilot edition of DTOS associated track titles and audio incorrectly, while the pieces presented here, with their current names and sequencing, are correct.\n\n\n\nNOTE: For those who wish to purchase only the CH excavation, you may do so digitally at the CH Bandcamp page:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/harvesters-dub",

      "about": "Recorded in 2008, during the same sessions as the drone-triptych POROUS VARIATIONS, and released a year later as a counterpoint to that album, NOXIOUS VARIATIONS remains a strange and surrealistic gem, glowing with irradiated blue-silvers and speaking in alien tongues that surely drove the miners who excavated it into a hypnotic lethargy. Where POROUS VARIATIONS is solid and smooth-surfaced drone music, mixed and organized almost symmetrically with a careful balance and a focus on mindfulness, NOXIOUS VARIATIONS feels mutant and oddly beautiful, even when the fidelity of the recordings themselves seems to push back against the sound becoming too much like \"music.\" \n\n\n\nIncluded here on this expanded double-disc set are all seven original pieces, remastered in the White Pillar Workshop twelve years later, augmented by the inclusion of \"Oubliette\", issued as a 3\" CD-R in 2009 (and possibly one of the heaviest tracks I've ever done), which is appended at the end of the first disc, as well as a second disc containing an expansive Coppice Halifax transfiguration of \"At Forest's Edge\", rendering the original NOXIOUS session tapes into a psychedelic deep techno experience. \n\n\n\nMusically, NOXIOUS VARIATIONS was created in distinct opposition to the clean and meditative environments explored on POROUS VARIATIONS, perhaps as a methodology for breaking apart monotony using most of the same equipment, and assisting in the demolition were several different instruments and machines that were either not instruments at all (a modified Toshiba tape recorder) or were in various states of disrepair (a thrift shop electric guitar that was disassembled and used for feedback experiments and contact microphone configurations). NOXIOUS VARIATIONS is an intensely textured session that resembles little else in my catalog, besides perhaps the Vhom double-album BORLEY RECTORY or some of the weirder moments on albums like NINE BILLION NAMES. The inclusion of \"Oubliette\" feels apt, as if the first seven tracks are barely containing their insides, just beneath the threshold of noise, only to finally explode in all directions in a great cosmic flash on \"Oubliette.\"\n\n\n\nThis reissue comes alongside the expanded edition of POROUS VARIATIONS, finally aligning both albums in their intended mirror-image contrasts, and offers two dense and multifaceted approaches to bedroom psychedelia to escape from the end of 2020 with.",

      "about": "Originally issued at Moody Drones as a digital-only affair containing the title track, Winterspheres appears here as a seasonally appropriate expanded physical edition, augmented by a second duophonic reprocessed mix of the original session. \n\n\n\nWinterspheres was created using a process of selective sampling on a Boss RC-20 looper, pulling tonal material from an ever-changing patch on a Roland SH-32 polyphonic digital synthesizer. Played by hand, and recorded to tape, with a minimum of FX processing used, it recalls the methods employed by myself and David Tagg for our prolific recordings at SSR from 2006-2010. Winterthrum reapproaches the tape recording and, by way of repeated downsampling and additional reverberation, manages to generate a warmer more restrained take on the piece. \n\n\n\nFurther still, a live session as Coppice Halifax was undertaken to mutate the source tape alongside drum machines and an analog bass monosynth, and this recording has been issued as Winterthaw:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/winterthaw",

Recorded during a snowed-in Winter evening in December of 2017, using four synthesizers laid to four-track cassette, Sembre Side Three slowly approaches like a greyscale tide from a soft white dawn, swelling into round brushstrokes and thin, trailing lines. At times, almost translucent, and at others, incredibly dense with the weight of silence compacting around the soundwaves invisibly...plaintive chords resonate in slow motion, while the higher and lower octave registers serve as pointillist outlines of a shape in space. A sad structure, stripped bare of almost any of the usual reverbs and delays that are omnipresent in ambient music. Heavily influenced by the work of Eliane Radigue, Folke Rabe, Eleh and Alvin Lucier, among many others.",

      "about": "In 2006, David Tagg and I formed a band called VCV, a project focused on ambient improvisations played on live instruments, and obsessed with symmetry and spaces of many different kinds. By 2007, we'd recorded enough that the project continued to expand beyond its own boundaries, and so we created a vessel project called The 21MG Series, an extension of VCV by way of David and I taking turns recording and releasing an EP each month, for four years. Although never prominently stated, The 21MG material was engineered as a collaboration, so that curious listeners could experiment and find wondrous results in combining our singular pieces. As such, all twenty-four of these pieces were constructed with great care and effort, in order to make them stand alone as solo works, or resonate together with other pieces. \n\n\n\nConcepts aside, these twenty-four pieces represent five-plus years of improvisational work on my behalf, work that I am still today very proud of. Oddly, perhaps because of the super-limited nature of everything David and I produced in our collaborating, this material has seemed to remain well under the radar of even the most stalwart followers. So here, for the first time, I'm happy to reissue these pieces as a landmark Milieu Music eight-disc box set. This material has all been quite scarce on any physical format (and only ever issued on 3\" CD-Rs), and off the map for quite some time. Anyone who enjoys my ambient records as Milieu would find a lot to explore here - over eight hours of sedate night-mood atmospherics, coaxed gently out of guitars, organ, bass, feedback and even the human voice. \n\n\n\nIn closing, I'd like to humbly thank David for giving this reissue his blessing - after all, without the talented Mr. Tagg, none of these pieces, and I mean none of them, would even exist.",

      "about": "In Autumn of 2017, the very first Ashcan catalog item was produced - a limited multi-disc collection of longform ambient and drone music bearing the title Bronzeworks, which contained seven previously issued recordings (Yellowed / Compost Springtime Shed / Forcefield / Train Line Triads / Foxfur / Starshield / V.R.H.) augmented by this piece, a previously unreleased recording culled from the Rolling Knoll archives, functionally designated the \"Bronzeworks Faceplate.\" This set was created, much like the rest of the Ashcan catalog that followed it, out of a desire to use recycled and off-cut materials discarded in the workshop during the material assembly part of putting new releases and designs together, to reduce waste and be creative about it. It was not privately commissioned, but it was offered first to a specific patron who had expressed interest in things like this, and they purchased it before the only copy of Bronzeworks was ever able to be made available to the public. (For context, this download comes with photographs of the Bronzeworks set before it was shipped out.) So, almost three years later, with the pandemic sweeping the globe, and digital music taking precedence over physical editions, I am publishing the Faceplate here for everyone to enjoy in the hopes that it will bring some comfort and peace to listeners who could certainly use it. Sonically speaking, the Faceplate was recorded using guitar feedback and possibly Lowrey organ on a four-track Tascam 414 tape machine in the Rolling Knoll studio, sometime between 2009-2011. It was left as unnamed and undated on one of many such tapes that were then rediscovered upon moving to Ohio in 2016.",

      "about": "Sun-Day. Over ten years of recording work, solidified in 122 tracks. Twenty-six hours, forty-six minutes and fifty seconds of sound, to be precise. Conceived as a soundtrack to a full day and night, something that was not merely ambient atmospheres, but twenty-four full-length albums, each as meticulously composed, arranged and detailed as any of my other records. On a deeper level, the project also encompasses and embodies many of my favorite \"eras\" present within my own back catalog. There are sad guitar loop blues like Eight Thousander, monochromatic drone walls like Porous Variations, deeply watered-down odes to the sea like Beyond The Stars, lonesome synth suites like Brother and tropical atmospheres dripping with humidity like Of The Apple. Across the hours and hours of session work that went into making Sun-Day, every single instrument in my studio was used multiple times...everything from conventional things like bass, electric and acoustic guitar and organ to synthesizers, tape machines, vintage oscillators and dozens of FX devices both analog and digital. Almost every album in Sun-Day originated as something performed live on a tape, then augmented with overdubs and mastered on a computer in the end, making the project cohesive both as a monolithic milemarker and twenty-four individual works.\n\n\n\nSo it is with a tired but proud mind that I am finally able to sit here, looking at 122 files on my screen and know that this many years of music making has finally been fulfilled. For the longest time, Sun-Day was that one idea that kept slipping away, never to be finished and doomed to be talked about for years to come. I stood on what I thought was the precipice of completing it several times, only to run cringing away from that ledge and continue my sculpting for another year or two. Today, it barely resembles the very first idea I had for it, way back in 2003, but that's probably for the better. I'm 32 years old, and have since released over 500 things, recorded even more, that have helped to organically sift and sort this massively perfectionist project over that time. \n\n\n\nBut is this the end? Many times, a close friend asked me what I'd have to work on once I finally finished Sun-Day, and I never knew what I'd even come up with. A 48-hour box set? Something equally ridiculous? At this point in time, I certainly hope not. I'll always make new things and sometimes (as with the recent Dripping Earth set) those things can become wildly overgrown tangents. The emphasis on what I have done here with Sun-Day, I can only hope, is that of continuity and consistency. Not that I have built such a massive structure in size and scope, but rather that I have done it continually, over time, and so in this way, the creative spring that has grown Sun-Day will never truly end. \n\n\n\nPresented here are all 24 parts of the Sun-Day series, released individually one album per month over two years, starting back in May 2013. No fat, no filler, no bonus tracks - just as sharp and to-the-point as twenty-six hours of audio can possibly be, at least within my experience. They're housed in a simple but sturdy lidded cardboard box, decorated tastefully with Sun-Day text stickers, and available as a filled 24-disc box or an empty box (for those of you who bought each volume as it was individually issued). Additionally, the digital version has been given a bargain price of $200, which is $40 less than it would cost you to purchase each release individually in the same format.",

Movements are discernable within the piece, but only barely. This is very physical sound that surrounds the listener, influenced by classic deeper listening like Chris Meloche, Eliane Radigue and David Tagg. Similar in form and function to Black Curtain Warmth, the recent pair of Sembre albums and some of the Sun-Day material.",

      "about": "Recorded live in-studio and streamed via audio/video feed to the Milieu Music Fan Club, AN EMPTY SEA is an improvisation in the \"old style\" of how I used to make records for Second Sun Recordings and INSTALL, my experimental imprints with David Tagg. As such, this recording recalls much of those earlier years in the way it builds up into a massive drone wall from the ether, cresting just below the clouds before withering back down into the waves below.\n\n\n\nIt's a monument to the past, and to being stranded at sea dreaming about a long forgotten lover. Cast your wine and jewels overboard, and burn all your maps. There's nothing left for you here except the ocean's salty tears and a scorching orange sun. Lie down, and give yourself to the Earth.",

Created using only a minimal setup of a Stylophone, a variety of effects such as a Behringer pitch shifter, a Boss RC-20 looper, a Moog low-pass filter, an Akai V1 Variwah and a Danelectro Reel Echo delay. This configuration was then fed through a Mackie 12-channel mixer, Sony TC-165 cassette recorder and an Alesis Quadraverb for multi-band equalization, before finally settling on a Tascam digital recorder. However, none of the equipment used seems to be reflected in the recording itself. Rather, Sembre is an ebbing pulse of drone music that fixates on a single chord and fully considers it, all the while accumulating inertia and volume from layer upon layer of nearly identical sonic inputs. At once terrestrially warm and coldly alien, this music is best appreciated in an intimate setting, alone, where it can be appropriately measured and experienced by the listener. \n\n\n\nThis is part one.",

      "about": "Gardensoil was originally recorded in demo form on a Yamaha QY-70 - an unlikely candidate for constructing longform, deep ambient works, yet an able tool all the same. The initial recordings were then taken from their cassette tape vessels and elongated, processed and nurtured to grow into the two extended pieces presented here. Intended to be experienced at low volumes, and mastered according to this intent, Gardensoil is an exercise in non-recurring melodic motifs that are presented as spaced apart events, organically happening and not happening, in an effort to distance the familiarity of the ear between tonalities. The first piece, which was previously issued digitally as part of the 4-hour charity compilation 3067 Megs at Recycled Plastics, explores the lower end of the frequency spectrum, over a backdrop of suburban field recordings. The second piece, previously unreleased in any form, inverts this approach in favor of midrange and higher frequency activities set against a nearly imperceptible analog hum. Together, they provide a lush and minimalistic sonic bath that subtly colors any room it fills - perfect for lazy nights indoors with a paperback, a cozy chair and/or your substance of choice.",

      "about": "Perfumes is a massive and exhaustively comprehensive collection of music written for now-extinct EPs, splits and compilations, as well as rare and unreleased material from the Milieu Music vaults. 8 discs, each one a meticulously arranged and sequenced album, bearing a vivid and tangential account of my experimental and drone work for the guitar (among other instruments) since 2005. Every piece has been carefully retrieved from the master tapes and remastered especially for this collection, and collectors will note the presence of many unreleased items in the set. A mindbending and essential release for any fan of my drone work or of experimental music in general - this is something you should buy and digest over a week off with either headphones or high fidelity audio systems with good low-frequency output.\n\n\n\nTo further add to the significance of this collection, Perfumes is being released to herald the arrival of the fabled SUN-DAY set - a 24-hour work of ambient experimentalism that will be released one hour per month over the course of the next two years, starting in May 2013. Sun-Day was conceptualized in 2004 and recording work on the project has been in progress ever since. More information about Sun-Day will appear online in May.",

      "about": "Workingman's Drone is a series I began in 2010, and these fifteen recordings represent the accumulation of the third year of this series. Unlike the first two years, wherein I would record and release a 20-minute EP every month, Year Three grew (much like the evergreen trees pictured as the series' logo) into album-length pieces for each month. \n\n\n\nThe series has always been intended as a home for my tastes in instrument-based drone and improvisational music (as opposed to making this type of music using computers), and this third leg of it is set apart from the prior ones even more, owing to a self-imposed restriction of using only ONE synthesizer for each month's session. This approach both broadened the scope of the series and narrowed the focus of the work, forcing me to truly study each instrument in order to produce these immersive and varied pieces, many of which are reflective of seasonal weather or elemental changes throughout the year. \n\n\n\nMusically, this change was necessitated by the continuous expansion and reconfiguration of my studio - having relocated from South Carolina's loft space Botany Bay to the basement bunker White Pillar nestled in an Ohio valley - and I relished the idea of really digging deep and exploring the differences in voice and color and workflow/interface between the many unique machines I now possess. Some are analog, some are digital. Some monophonic, some polyphonic. Some are not even synthesizers by definition, but rather, repurposed medical equipment or even drum machines that have particularly deep processing and synthesis capabilities. \n\n\n\nWorkingman's Drone casts no preferences - it is a discipline that embraces the process and the performance, rather than the provenance or the brand. The drone deifies machines both classic and castaway, and sings in all voices, across all octaves and all frequencies. Year Three collects an immense amount of audio - nearly 18 hours - and solidifies it into a monument that is both a towering tribute to my influences held dear, and a sprawling scenic path through my creative continent. \n\n\n\nSYNTHESIZER VOICES: \n\n\n\nWD25 / Korg Volca Keys\n\nWD26 / Dave Smith Instruments MoPho\n\nWD27 / Boss Dr. Synth DS-330\n\nWD28 / Korg MS-20\n\nWD29 / Arturia Microbrute\n\nWD30 / Korg Monologue\n\nWD31 / Korg Minilogue\n\nWD32 / Grass CTCM\n\nWD33 / Boss Dr. Rhythm DR-880\n\nWD34 / Korg Volca Kick\n\nWD35 / Roland SH-32\n\nWD36 / Korg Volca Bass\n\nWDY3B / Korg Minilogue\n\nWDY3C / Korg Volca Kick\n\nWDY3D / Arturia Microbrute",

      "about": "Workingman's Drone was a series concept drafted in the wake of my guitar work at Second Sun Recordings, the ambient and drone imprint I created with David Tagg. Much like the 21MG Series, Workingman's Drone generated one 20-minute piece of endless tonal bliss each month, for twelve months. At the end of the year, all twelve were compiled into a box set and augmented by a 13th appendage. The series went so well that I picked it up for another year, until it finally sailed off into the sunset. The WD pieces are sometimes improvised, sometimes composed and overdubbed. Every sound source imaginable has been used on the recordings - guitars, bass, synthesizers, organ, bells, feedback, radio, trains, appliances and even human voice - making the series a vibrant collection of drone music that truly embraces the challenge to use anything available that might imply a tonality. As experimental as that description might seem, many of the pieces from Workingman's Drone are quite chordal and melodic, hardly ever dissonant or irritating. Everything has been meticulously reined in and labored over until only the most pleasant frequencies and soundwaves remain. Many times, WD pieces were given days of endless looping, while I gradually affected the sounds until they felt complete. \n\n\n\nHere, for the first time ever, the Workingman's Drone material has been made available on standard 5\" CD-Rs. The original pressings were all released on 3\" mini CD-Rs, thereby excluding a quotient of listeners who didn't have a compatible player. The entire second year of the series appears here, including WD13-24, WDY (Trace, the appendage packaged with the 13x3\" box sets) and a previously unreleased Coppice Halifax excavation - a monolithic 54 minute remix using elements of all twelve parts of WD: Year Two, which provides an illuminating counterpoint, and an air of finality to the cliffs and valleys of sound contained herein.",

Except it isn't entirely new, but familiar enough to make sense. Shades of previous lives resurface slightly, echoes of past songs come creeping slowly back. Those two iconic fir trees we pressed into so many surfaces with dark ink have themselves grown even taller, ready to bear the fruits of a second year's harvest. Twelve more months of unbreakable hand-crafted drones for the working man, delivered one month at a time, and culminating in a second boxed set after the year is finished.",

      "about": "Womb Oscillations is a five-volume set of recordings, both unprocessed and processed, that document and abstractly represent the growth of my daughter before her birth on April 10th, 2012. As many people who know me personally can attest to - I am obsessively carrying an audio recorder almost everywhere I go, and will never pass on any opportunity to record things that I find fascinating, personal or important. As such, my wife's months of pregnancy gave me a chance to record things I'd never have a chance to again - the sound of my unborn daughter's heartbeat. I purchased a fetal doppler device in February 2012 and proceeded to have nightly \"sessions\" where we would isolate her heart-throbs and record them until she moved out of range. Once I'd collected about an hour of this audio, I went to work carefully processing it in different ways. What did a prenatal human heart sound like if I used it as the source sound to create a sustained tonal drone piece? I had to know. In addition to this recording and experimenting, I also began to do discreet room recordings during my wife's increasingly frequent ultrasounds. These field recordings were mostly meant as a set of personal memoirs from that time, although once again I could not resist the urge to process them in artful ways. So what I've ended up with is a massive work of deep and engaging experimental audio - split into five detailed volumes:\n\n\n\nPhase One: Naked Genesis [Unaltered Documents Of Prenatal Growth] (61:55)\n\nPhase Two: S1 [Feedback Sculpture Triptych] (73:50)\n\nPhase Three: S2 [Feedback Extension For Low-Decibel Playback] (59:00)\n\nPhase Four: Evaporants In Mono [Archive I] (56:59)\n\nPhase Five: Evaporants In Mono [Archive II] (39:05)\n\n\n\nPhase One contains the original and unedited recordings of my daughter's heartbeat in utero via a fetal doppler device and binaural microphone. Phase Two contains three \"feedback sculptures\" - drone pieces built using the audio from Phase One as the sole input source, alongside a complex system of exponential reverb processing. Phase Three contains an hour-long suite of a very minimal sculpture, specially mastered at a lower volume level for more atmospheric playback. Phase Four and Phase Five are the results of processing the ultrasound room recordings with analog reverb and selective equalization and compression - essentially reducing human speech and the acoustic sounds of physical movement to abstracted trails of tone and texture.\n\n\n\nThis set has been kept away until the perfect release date - December 16th, 2012 - my 8th wedding anniversary and our first with our daughter. Considering the size and length of this project, only sixteen copies of the release are being produced physically.",

      "about": "Nine years ago, I began the Workingman's Drone series, a serialized EP catalog issuing one 20-minute drone recording each month. The series issued 12 EPs in 2010 and another 12 in 2012, and has been on hiatus since. Now, seven years later, I am finally ready to offer a third exploration of these surreal sonic forests, and for the first time in the Workingman's template, each month's edition will be a full-length recording, instead of a 20-minute piece. \n\n\n\nFor Workingman's third, I have also opted to implement some basic rules for the way these recordings are allowed to manifest, the first being that each month's installment will be created using only a single synthesizer, and the second rule being that each month must use a different synthesizer than the last. In the seven years since I've carved paths through these tall trees, I have relocated to a new home 600 miles away, and expanded my studio considerably. As such, these recordings are intended as intimate and focused studies of the machines that are generating them, isolated and given full command of the frequency spectrum and stereo field. \n\n\n\nThe third volume of Workingman's third was constructed using a Boss DS-330 Dr. Synth polyphonic digital synthesizer, in tandem with the following reverberation and delay units: Pioneer SR202W spring reverb, Boss RV-3 digital reverb, BBE Two Timer analog delay, Alesis Quadraverb digital reverb/delay and two onboard custom DSP FX built into my Peavey FX2 24-channel mixing board, plus additional pitch augmentation via a Digitech WH-4. \n\n\n\nDue to the intense level of calm induced by the constant vibrations present in these sessions, the runtimes of these recordings can sometimes run well past the length of a CD-R's 80 minutes. The digital edition of each release will be the unedited full session recording, while the CD-R editions will contain edits or composites that accurately represent the work while still being able to fit on a single disc.",

      "about": "Workingman's Drone was a series concept drafted in the wake of my guitar work at Second Sun Recordings, the ambient and drone imprint I created with David Tagg. Much like the 21MG Series, Workingman's Drone generated one 20-minute piece of endless tonal bliss each month, for twelve months. At the end of the year, all twelve were compiled into a box set and augmented by a 13th appendage. The series went so well that I picked it up for another year, until it finally sailed off into the sunset. The WD pieces are sometimes improvised, sometimes composed and overdubbed. Every sound source imaginable has been used on the recordings - guitars, bass, synthesizers, organ, bells, feedback, radio, trains, appliances and even human voice - making the series a vibrant collection of drone music that truly embraces the challenge to use anything available that might imply a tonality. As experimental as that description might seem, many of the pieces from Workingman's Drone are quite chordal and melodic, hardly ever dissonant or irritating. Everything has been meticulously reined in and labored over until only the most pleasant frequencies and soundwaves remain. Many times, WD pieces were given days of endless looping, while I gradually affected the sounds until they felt complete. \n\n\n\nHere, for the first time ever, the Workingman's Drone material has been made available on standard 5\" CD-Rs. The original pressings were all released on 3\" mini CD-Rs, thereby excluding a quotient of listeners who didn't have a compatible player. The entire first year of the series appears here, including WD1-12, WDX (Lavender Billows, the appendage packaged with the 13x3\" box sets) and a previously unreleased Coppice Halifax excavation - a monolithic 58 minute remix using elements of all twelve parts of WD: Year One, which provides an illuminating counterpoint, and an air of finality to the cliffs and valleys of sound contained herein.",

      "about": "Year Four of the Workingman's Drone series continued where Year Three left off - single-voice or single-machine studies of sustained-tone drone music, released one session per month, for a year. Unlike Year Three, however, much of Year Four's source sound was shaped by a theme of absence, with many of the sessions focusing upon input-less scenarios of self-oscillating filters, feedback routing and low-frequency oscillators driven well into audible range - informed by a sense of being surrounded by possible musics that remained invisible and peripheral until and unless I tuned the correct instruments and pointed them in these directions. \n\n\n\nThat said, more \"traditionalist\" sessions materialized as well, such as WD43's 'Ombilical Brainwave Tether' being one of my first sessions with the Roland Juno 106 polyphonic synthesizer, or WD45's 'Pareidoliad' being my first session with a Moog Werkstatt synthesizer (all my prior Moog sessions were in fact generated by self-oscillating a Moogerfooger MF-101 lowpass filter, or using the carrier output wave from a Moogerfooger MF-102 ring modulator - both are indeed Moog synthesizers in a technical sense, but neither were designed to played as instruments necessarily). These sessions felt significant in their own ways, given their usage of machines that I quite literally never imagined I'd have the opportunity to design with. So Year Four is a combinatorial work that measures the emptiness of the abyss against more Earthen and human aspects, but presents them all in a uniform sense according to the ethos of the project. \n\n\n\nTaken all together, Year Four is another monolith of drone music, within a landscape that is itself filled with many other such structures, and if I didn't enjoy using sessions such as these to the degree that I do, for meditating and sleeping and generally just disconnecting from the stress of everyday life, I would question why I even recorded them to begin with. Aren't drones by any other name going to sound just as sweet (as the Bard might ask)? To answer this, I feel it must be noted that the disparate sound sources that I have gone out of my way to have dedicated sessions with are in fact the discipline itself - an exercise in material and spiritual asceticism, a challenge given to myself to prove (???) just what may be accomplished using a minimum of tools. \n\n\n\nFor something that is ultimately a proof of concept work, the act of proving is immediately redundant upon listening - reasoning, justification, expectation, all of those things melt away beneath the wall that I've laid down before. The drone becomes everything - it looks backward to a primordial time when the plates were shifting and microbial life first began, it looks forward into the void, to the end of time, space, sound itself (see my essay 'The Last Music' published at Difficult Art & Music, 2022:  difficultartandmusic.bandcamp.com/album/everything-lasts-forever-and-nothing-ever-dies-a-compendium-of-drone-in-all-its-guises  ) and as such, it is the very definition of totality, all-encompassing in every direction. In doing these sessions, I feel I have attuned myself to things that feel elemental, timeless, vibrations that (for all I know) exist somewhere else in the universe, on some deserted planet, where the shape of rocks and the velocity and direction of wind patterns combine to produce this sonorous annunciation of nothing at all. \n\n\n\nSo, here they are collected in one long, deep breath of sound, another monument to deify the vibration at the center of everything that exists, and whether your cranium or eardrums allow you to resonate where my body resonates, feeling what I am feeling, as these masses of sound wash over us both, is simply a matter of biology. If you know, you know, and if you don't, then pass this by as you might any other nondescript building or unexplored path. Perhaps your destination is still yet to come. \n\n\n\nN.B. There is a bonus 13th session with the Behringer TD-3 included, previously unreleased, recorded on June 13 2021. This session has also been issued separately (digitally) for those who do not wish to buy the full collection in order to obtain it.",

In the seven years since I've carved paths through these tall trees, I have relocated to a new home 600 miles away, and expanded my studio considerably. As such, these recordings are intended as intimate and focused studies of the machines that are generating them, isolated and given full command of the frequency spectrum and stereo field. \n\n\n\nThis first recording was constructed using a Korg Volca Keys polyphonic analog synthesizer, in tandem with the following reverberation and delay units: Pioneer SR202W spring reverb, Boss RV-3 digital reverb, BBE Two Timer analog delay, Alesis Quadraverb digital reverb/delay and two onboard custom DSP FX built into my Peavey FX2 24-channel mixing board.\n\n\n\nDue to the intense level of calm induced by the constant vibrations present in these sessions, the runtimes of these recordings can sometimes run well past the length of a CD-R's 80 minutes. The digital edition of each release will be the unedited full session recording, while the CD-R editions will contain edits or composites that accurately represent the work while still being able to fit on a single disc.",

      "about": "Nine years ago, I began the Workingman's Drone series, a serialized EP catalog issuing one 20-minute drone recording each month. The series issued 12 EPs in 2010 and another 12 in 2012, and has been on hiatus since. Now, seven years later, I am finally ready to offer a third exploration of these surreal sonic forests, and for the first time in the Workingman's template, each month's edition will be a full-length recording, instead of a 20-minute piece. \n\n\n\nFor Workingman's third, I have also opted to implement some basic rules for the way these recordings are allowed to manifest, the first being that each month's installment will be created using only a single synthesizer, and the second rule being that each month must use a different synthesizer than the last. In the seven years since I've carved paths through these tall trees, I have relocated to a new home 600 miles away, and expanded my studio considerably.

      "about": "The first of three supplemental recordings to be issued on the occasion of the Workingman's Drone: Year Three box set, this session was originally recorded during patch design and rehearsal for what would become the extensive body of Glassrain Haloprism Claustrophobia / WD31. Created live using the Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer, Collapsing Suns is a slowly shifting wall of midrange and high-frequency vibration that recalls Radigue's \"Adnos\", Lucier's \"Music On A Long Thin Wire\" and Folke Rabe's \"Was??\", all of which I was listening to extensively at the time. It attempts a very specific combination of electric shimmer, monochromatic gain and extremely slow shifts in oscillator movement, which is sometimes quite difficult to achieve while being limited to using only one synthesizer.",

Clouds and Strymon's Magneto for alternative harmonic pitch deviations and a wider, thicker stereo image. This recording continues Year Four's ethos of exploring non-traditional signal sources as primary voices, such as low-frequency oscillators, self-oscillating filters and even no-input feedback configurations, as these tools often yield interesting and unique sonic results that so-called \"standard\" synthesizer voices may not. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

The LPF is made to self-oscillate, which produces a pure sinewave, and this signal is then sent into an SSDP Jade Series phaser, with the phase-shifted output and all-pass filtered output split and sent into a Behringer mult. The all-passed signal is then routed into one of two ring modulation inputs on the Behringer 150 module, using the 150's onboard sawtooth LFO to adjust the pitch of the ringmod, while the phase-shifted signal is sent into two Mutable Instruments modules - Rings (in this patch acting as an overtone generator) and Clouds (acting as a granular pitch shifter). Additionally, the all-passed signal is sent into a Dreadbox Utopia module, utilizing the \"Pulserizer\" input, which bitcrushes the sound and in turn generates a more angular waveform. All signals were then summed via two submixers (SSDP Jade Series switch mixer and a Doepfer VC mixer) before going into their final stereo positions via a Behringer 305. The 305's output was sent into a Mackie ProFX8 mixer with some additional parametric EQ work applied, before then going into two channels of a Peavey FX2 mixing desk, the output of which was captured digitally and mastered in a DAW, where final equalization, some subtle delays and compression were used to create the mix presented here. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

I used a convoluted process of routing the MF-105M into itself to create a feedback loop, which I could then control more definitively via the MIDI output of an Arturia Keystep Pro. The resultant audio is a very electrical sounding sustained drone, which has possibly the most \"appliance\" sounding personality (in overtones) that I've yet heard come out of one of my studio filters. Using the Keystep, it is possible to \"play\" the resonant filter bands similar to a synthesizer, though the MF-105M behaves much less musically than a traditional synth. In the end, I managed to layer together multiple such sessions via a Vesta Fire MR-10B multitrack tape machine to produce a much richer chordal profile, and using the Vesta Fire's DBX noise reduction (which acts essentially as a low-pass filter) and pitch deviation, different timbres and modulations were made possible. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular:  17463.space/wdy4.txt",

      "about": "The third of three supplemental recordings to be issued on the occasion of the Workingman's Drone: Year Three box set, this session was an earlier rehearsal take of WD29 (Feast Of The Libertines) that was accidentally recorded in mono, and subsequently expanded in post, using additional FX processing, multitracking via a Vesta Fire MR10-B cassette machine and an Optimus SSM-1750 mixer. It resembles aspects of WD29, but ultimately sounds more like a microcosm that was buried beneath it. Distillation Isolate is the final curtain on the third leg of Workingman's Drone, the last coat of paint on a dense stone monument.",

      "about": "The second of three supplemental recordings to be issued on the occasion of the Workingman's Drone: Year Three box set, this session was an experiment I'd been curious to try for some time, and finally recorded on Halloween night, October 2019. Having set up a generative/self-oscillating patch on the Korg Volca Kick monophonic analog synthesizer, and left it to broadcast online via Twitch for two hours (while I went out trick-or-treating in the snow with my daughter), I used the volume levels of my Peavey mixer, the input/output of my Zoom H1 recorder and the OBS software I use to broadcast to affect a very specific digital gain profile on the outgoing drone. As a result, the recording I ended up releasing of that session (WD34) was direct from the Peavey board, and did not reflect the broadcast's more distorted sound. The final aspect of the experiment was to record the broadcast itself back through different FX units (such as octavers, filters, reverbs and delays) and a different Mackie mixer, which produced the completely altered mix you hear now. This recording happened in realtime, during the same Twitch broadcast from the Volca Kick/Peavey board output, essentially using the internet itself as an audio processor.\n\n\n\nNOTE: The digital version of this release is over two hours, the full and unedited recording of the original session. The CD-R contains an abridged recording, built to fit within the limits of an 80-minute disc.",

For reasons I will not detail here, this machine unexpectedly found its way into my studio recently, and I've been slowly approaching it by using it in very specific applications, with great care and consideration placed on that usage. It made sense that my Workingman's Drone series was well-suited to a session of quiet reflection and introspection with this very unique synthesizer, so July's entry in the series is only this. All six notes of the Juno's polyphony, utilizing both the pulse wave and sawtooth wave DCOs as well as the square sub-oscillator and just the slightest amount of the noise generator, and chorus #1, while the Juno ruminates on my six-note chord for over an hour. In post, this recording was cleaned up via a parametric EQ and overlaid upon itself at six different pitch iterations, forming the totality of the piece you hear. Intermittent crackles are peppered throughout, due to the aged machine's VCA becoming unstable, although the EQ and slight plate reverb placed on the auxiliary send channel manage to render these imperfections into a somewhat more cozy and textured atmosphere. \n\n\n\nOMBILICAL BRAINWAVE TETHER is dedicated to R.G.\n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

To begin, the feedback signal from Magneto was tempered and shaped by a 2HP low pass filter (with a very slow LFO sweeping the filter open and closed again) as well as ring modulation via a Behringer 150 utility module. The subsequent output was then multed to a Doepfer VC mixer, for the dry output, and also sent into Mutable Inst. Rings (for tuned overtone generation) and Mutable Inst. Clouds (for granular processing/pitch alteration/reverb/filter passing). The sum total of these signals were mixed on a Mackie ProFX8 mixing board, with minor augmentation via the Mackie's internal DSP reverb, and then routed again through a Peavey FX2 mixing desk, with yet another DSP verb applied to a wide stereo signal. Final mastering was completed on the computer, with appropriate use of parametric equalization and light compression. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

In addition to the usual method of tuning both oscillators to form a chord, I have also brought both LFOs into the audible range and tuned them accordingly, allowing the module four voices of polyphony. Additional modulation of the waveforms themselves, as well as the filter, was introduced via other modules within my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, albeit on an extremely subtle level, with immensely slow envelopes and barely any voltage getting through the attenuators at all. The resultant audio is a warm and shimmering wall of oscillation that rings true with the ethos of this series, and also introduces the first recording of Year Four that exceeds the runtime limit of CD-Rs, necessitating a modest edit of the piece to be used for the physical editions. As always, the full unedited session appears here digitally for the ideal deep listening experience. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

      "about": "The Silver Pioneer was a session recorded on June 13th, 2021, under a similar concept to LSZ's recent 'Pierce/Coupling' recording being issued for the 60th anniversary of Telstar 1's launch (  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com/album/pierce-coupling  ). Silver Pioneer relates back to my father's first birthday after I was brought into the world - Monday, June 13th, 1983 - when the Pioneer 10 space probe passed beyond the orbit of Neptune, making it the first man-made object to leave the central solar system. Synchronicity is something that I've grown more and more fascinated by, as I grow older, and this strange Venn diagram of myself in the year of my birth, my father's birthday and the first Earthen machine to cross into the greater abyss feels like some kind of alignment that holds significance. So, to mark that moment in time, I held a special session on the Behringer TD-3, a nearly 1:1 reinstatement of the much more iconic Roland TB-303, where it was employed in a very unorthodox way to hold a single oscillator tone, in order to then be further expanded upon within my R-EW Audioholistics modular system. A cosmic mile-marker, a heraldic plinth that exists to suffuse three very different moments in time and space, bound by shaped voltage and acoustic vibration. A sustained and endless line to drawn like a path that follows Pioneer 10, wherever and whenever it may yet be. \n\n\n\nN.B. The Silver Pioneer is included as a bonus session with the other twelve sessions collected in Workingman's Drone: Year Four. Anyone purchasing that set, digitally or physically, will obtain it as part of that set.",

      "about": "Workingman's Drone returns with Year Four, twelve more monthly installments of carefully crafted drone music to be issued from January to December of 2021.\n\n\n\nFor the eleventh volume, catalog entry WD47, we hear the sound of two bristling walls of pink noise (generated by a Behringer 150 utility module), routed into the input of Mutable Instruments Rings, a Karplus-Strong synthesis engine that is also able to interpret any inbound sound material and tune it into something musical, through its use of overtones and resonation. Interestingly enough, Karplus-Strong synthesis involves an imperceptibly short noise burst that acts as a trigger mechanism for an extremely resonant and fast-rate delay, which is what in turn produces sounds that are similar in texture and timbre to an actual string being plucked or scraped. By routing pure noise into this module, it is possible to achieve an infinite level of sustain from those overtones and resonant shapes. The subsequent output of Rings after this point was then sent into two different low-pass filters (2HP LPF and Disting Mk4) before moving on to a Tascam DP-008EX multitrack digital recorder for overdubbing at different pitches. What results is a beautifully deep and dense wall of droning sound, humming in unison, not once letting on that a noise generator was the imprint for this session's approach. The final mix and master was completed several months later, utilizing an Arturia ladder filter and parametric equalization on the master bus in order to congeal the multiple layers of dubbed drones together into a singular mass. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

The internal equalizer of the mixer was used to tune different lines of independently routed feedback, two at a time, and subsequently layered and individually filtered through a Moog MF-101 low-pass filter and a Tascam DP-008EX digital eight-track recorder. In post, subtle use of additional filtering, reverberation and modulated delay was employed within a DAW using mostly Arturia virtual processors, as well as copious shaping with multiple parametric equalizers. \n\n\n\nThe resultant recording is an exercise that illustrates many of the core concepts of the Workingman's Drone series, format and ethos - designed stillness achieved through sustained tone minimalism, self-oscillation and no-input asceticism providing a pure and distinct method of synthesis to explore, the study of singular sound sources for each individual piece and, hopefully, a reusable and accessible psychedelic state obtained via immersive, hypnotic and operatively endless listening that can be utilized for sleep, focused work or meditation. \n\n\n\nThe fourth year of Workingman's Drone has charted an observable path through these notions, and in so doing, has generated a considerable body of work that feels distinct from prior years of the series, and hopefully the wider landscape of drone music itself. In a world defined by chaos and unpredictability, filled with suffering and inhospitable situations, it is my sincere hope that these sessions can provide a reliable escape from the often claustrophobic overwhelming nature of our times.  \n\n\n\nwww.17463.space/wdy4.txt",

      "about": "Workingman's Drone returns with Year Four, twelve more monthly installments of carefully crafted drone music to be issued from January to December of 2021.\n\n\n\nFor the ninth volume, catalog entry WD45, a significant studio milestone comes to pass, wherein we explore the voice of a Moog Werkstatt monophonic analog synthesizer. The Werkstatt is the first proper Moog voice acquired for my work, slightly discounting the three Moogerfooger units I purchased from David Tagg several years ago (two of which can be utilized as voices, incidentally, between the ring modulator's carrier signal and the low-pass filter's self-oscillation), so the urge to build a wall using the Werkstatt was not an easy one to ignore. At a technical level, the Werkstatt is being used to generate pseudo polyphony by way of a tuned pulse wave VCO pitch, with pulsewidth modulation controlled by a very fast triangle wave LFO, which created something akin to overtones from a ring modulator. Additionally, the filter is being used with its resonance pushed up to the fullest allowable, and the low-pass cutoff being very slowly swept by an external LFO from my modular system, which allows the resonance to cycle through various different tonal profiles, always peaking and returning to the base of a valley, establishing a beautifully mountainous motif. From there, the audio output of the Werkstatt was multed via an SSDP Jade Series multiple, where it was then made into a stereo signal by way of two different low-pass filters (Disting Mk4 and 2HP LPF) that were themselves routed into a Tiptop MISO, in order to facilitate the two slightly altered multed signals being sent in full stereo into/out of a Strymon Magneto and Mutable Instruments Clouds. Lastly, one more multed copy of the Moog signal was fed into an SSDP Jade Series phaser, which was swept very slowly via a Dreadbox Utopia's LFO, and sent into a Doepfer A-135-2 mixer, which amplified it before sending it out to the main mixer. All five signals were equalized and mixed via a Mackie ProFX8 mixing board before terminating in a Peavey FX2 mixing desk for one final pass of parametric EQ and panning adjustments. \n\n\n\nA few more detailed thoughts about Workingman's Drone as a series, and where it sits in the landscape of ambient and drone music in particular: 17463.space/wdy4.txt",

      "about": "Another year of Workingman's Drone sessions produced twelve longform recordings that, much like many of my beatless sound explorations, were developed as much for their utility in subsequent creative tangents as their approachability as music. With this in mind, the MICRODOT TRANSMISSIONS are the resultant recordings generated by re-processing and transfiguring much longer drone pieces into (relatively) shorter runtimes between fifteen and thirty minutes. \n\n\n\nWhen working to elongate sound, certain decisions are inevitably made in order to facilitate something that can sustain itself aesthetically across a longer period of time, and the same caveats exist for the inverse, although this seems to be a direction rarely explored, except when musicians wish to edit their compositions for existing time constraints, such as vinyl or tape sides, performance limitations or broadcast schedules. In order to compress and reduce a very long piece of tonal sound into sound-matter that does not simply feel \"sped up\", other processes are used to essentially \"fold\" the sound in onto itself in soft and seamless patterns, and drone music in particular is perfectly suited to the digital tools used in this scenario. \n\n\n\nMICRODOT TRANSMISSIONS feel like echoes of their former selves - lone plinths abandoned in an otherwise empty landscape, once a majestic city, and even a majestic ruin, now merely a single column weathering itself down into sand. As with the first volume, the second addresses the bleakness of its inherent design with a sense of resignation, succumbing to the abyss, feeling absorbed by the totality of what must only be described as the end of all things. MICRODOT zeroes in on this cosmic dread with a laser precise focus, and presents it pointillistically, a blotter sheet of monochrome doom, saturated with lust and secrets, a hidden paean to the sweet downslope of entropy. \n\n\n\nTune in, turn off, give up.",

      "about": "Following the retrieval of the long-lost Grey Anthelion album, as well as the reinstating of the 2008 Anthelion sessions (White / Night / Red / Black), I came to realize that there was still much left to say using this sound-assembly approach I conceived over a decade ago. Anthelion recordings are one of many attempts to distill elemental and atmospheric sound into something vaguely musical, or at the very least tonal, while also rendering any potential instrumental voices down to texture and faux-environmental surroundings. So, with the advent of the 2019 Spring season, I felt it appropriate to renew, revise and reiterate with Anthelion once (or actually twice) more. \n\n\n\nBlue Anthelion was considered as a softer, sunnier counterpart to Green Anthelion, which is more forestial, and even dusky in parts. Dozens of field recordings are layered carefully and deliberately to create a swirling humid mass of Spring atmosphere, while a smeared lens goes in and out of focus on reflected sunlight across the surface of a river. Thunderstorms transfigured into bit-reduced sub bass fog, swimming pools spattered through panned delays like dub chords, rainfall washing over Carolinian and Ohioan rooftops, windchimes swaying in the gust of April showers. A wide stereo field of high and low frequencies operating as psychedelic weather. The temperature, texture and pressure changes of Springtime, routed to 20+ output channels and conveyed across a digital spiral.",

The first of the pair, YELLOW ANTHELION, distills the blinding brightness of a noonday sun, the spirited birdsong in the backyard valley and the distant wind blowing through flags, trees, grassy lawns and open windows. Various FX chains and generative/recurrent/self-oscillating processing configurations have been employed to take the incoming source sounds of field recordings and other Summer textures, and transfigure them into a wider array of audio that takes full advantage of higher and lower realms of the frequency spectrum. The result is one equally Earthen and alien, a swirling surrealistic mindscape of sonic paint that moves and breathes as if it were the Summer itself, taking influences from field recordists such as Chris Watson, Irv Teibel, David Burraston, Dan Gibson and Kiyoshi Mizutani, as well as pioneers like Wendy Carlos, Mika Vainio, Richard Chartier and Francisco Lopez. A headtrip that will appeal to ambient bedroom listeners as well as hi-fi experimentalists and weather/texture seekers.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, two Coppice Halifax excavations of each Anthelion will be soon issued as YELLOW COMPOST and ORANGE COMPOST. A link will be posted here when these recordings become available.",

      "about": "In 2008, I embarked on four different recording sessions with the intent to create music that was equal parts field recording and elemental improvisations on instruments that were textured and prepared in such a way that they wouldn't be thought of in musical terms. In hindsight, I don't think I quite got to where I was wanting to go, as the Anthelion recordings still lack a complete synergy between the instrumental parts and the atmospheric parts, but somewhere in there I think I found a good combination of sound design despite that. \n\n\n\nUntil now, these releases have remained out of print, and were issued on low print runs to begin with (I think White/Night Anthelion were around twenty copies each), and existed only in the bodiless digital realm here on the web. The decision was also made to reissue these recordings without any remastering work, even though I think certain parts of their recording processes were done quite crudely compared to how I might approach the same work now. This is because there is a surrealism about these pieces, the placement of all of the elements feels...off...in certain moments, and I would like to preserve the outright oddness of these recordings as much as possible. The only editing that was done was to reassemble the individual pieces on White & Night Anthelion into singular longform pieces, as they were originally recorded. \n\n\n\nMusically, you might wonder what's going on within these tracks, then? White Anthelion was inspired by the sub-bass droning of Sunn O))), Oren Ambarchi and Shinobu Nemoto's underappreciated Elephant Talks album (see:  moufurokuon.bandcamp.com/album/elephant-talks  ). It is four extended suites of live sub-bass sequencer improvisation set over an airy bed of wind and chimes, recorded on the front porch outside my Rolling Knoll studio window. At times darker and dronier, and others more melodic and ambient, White Anthelion feels almost as if it exists only in the periphery of your listening, occupying only very low and mostly high frequency bands, only the occasional plink of a wooden wind chime coming in and out of the midrange. The rest of it is a body of air, pushed through the subtropical south where I lived at that time. \n\n\n\nNight Anthelion came about as a reprocessing of the White Anthelion recordings, intended as a mutation of the same idea, set against a nighttime backdrop instead of a sunny daytime one. Somewhere, the original plucked bass notes were melted down into a ring-modulated fuzzed out hum, shuddering and whirring in a cricket-sung backyard. The tonal aspects of Night Anthelion more resemble a generator or engine of some kind, rumbling in the weedy space between suburban housing. Chimes are once again present as a backdrop, this time metallic ones, recorded at Foxhill and layered four times over themselves via a four-track tape recorder, further out in the country than my Rolling Knoll studio was. I may not have known it consciously at that time, but Night Anthelion played into my interests in appliance hums and the shimmering drones that can come from a lawnmower, refrigerator or air conditioning unit. These days, I am always in pursuit of exploring the differences in noise and vibration between these things, and have devoted more singular recordings to such sounds, like Naked Sound Seventeen and Eighteen. \n\n\n\nAfter these first two sessions were completed and released, I revisited the original idea on two shorter sessions again later that year - Red Anthelion being my first attempt at completely synthesizing a field recording, trying to create a convincing recording of a physical space, without any organic input at all. The end result was slowly generated like a lucid dream, imagining a windy grove of cherry trees swaying in a night time breeze. Black Anthelion was a much more angular affair, synthesizing a drone piece out of recordings of airplanes going by overhead, once again returning to the fascination I hold with mechanically produced drone sounds. Red and Black both inhabit somewhat opposite disciplines in their creation, but function well back to back as singular pieces of psychedelic ambient sound. \n\n\n\nAs with many of the reissue assemblies coming out of the Arboreal Digest reissue series, a Coppice Halifax excavation of the source material was drafted, and in this case, manifested as a nearly forty minute retake of the Night Anthelion recordings. Building on the original's wavering tonal tension and shadowy textures, the CH \"Dusk Lion\" stands as a formidable closing curtain on this surreal tableau of experimental material, and fills out a triple album set that once again reinstates these recordings for a second lifespan.",

      "about": "After a decade-plus pause, I resumed work within the ANTHELION concept in Spring of 2019, intent on producing two full-length recordings for each of the four seasons as they came to pass - two perspectives on and interpretations of the environmental changes during these elemental quarters. \n\n\n\nThe ethos of ANTHELION has always been driven by a sound-design and synthesis-minded approach of processing non-musical content into something stimulating on musical terms, and vice versa. Transfiguring layer upon layer of field recordings into a swirling wall of texture and mass, where individual places and times washed together to produce an entirely new time and space to explore. Reducing musical instruments or even pre-recorded compositions down to their molecular abstracts, distilling strains of temperature and color-coded DNA out of them to plant like seeds inside the new atmosphere I was mapping out. \n\n\n\nANTHELION not only studies the sounds and reference points that we associate with seasonal changes, but also recalls other associations to these specific calendar months, like holidays or color palettes or religious/familial traditions. It coagulates all of what a word like \"Summer\" conjures in the mind and alchemically redrafts it into the shape of a repeatable listening experience. \n\n\n\nSo, as the Spring equinox once again approaches, I have compiled all eight recording sessions that were undertaken within the ANTHELION methodology. Totaling almost nine hours of immersive audio, this collection offers something like a weather-indexed library of works, that you may pull recordings from in the same way you might pick out a coat from a coat closet. Conversely, it also proposes a method of escapism - the sound of a snow-coated Winter in the hateful heat of Summer, the green pastures and birdsong of Spring when Autumn has laid all such things to rot and memory - ANTHELION is therapeutic meditation for the seasonally affected. \n\n\n\nFrom this moment forward, recordings drafted under the ANTHELION banner will continue, but this time they will be exploring specific elements, natural phenomena and proposing designs for specific events and locations, whether they are truly within human reach or not. Until these recordings come to pass, these nine hours of material will no doubt continue to yield rich dividends for those willing to invest some time and patience into their deep tangents...",

      "about": "Upon assembling the masters for the 2008 Anthelion recordings' 2019 reissue, I stumbled across this three-track album from 2009 that I thought lost for most of the last decade. Originally planned as a \"Live Anthelion\" release, these three pieces focused individually on isolated instrumental sound sources, presented in an almost purist approach. They are each live iterations of Anthelion - a conceptual title that is never given life as a \"standard recorded version\", but rather, an ongoing series of elementally and seasonally inspired variations. \n\n\n\nRevisiting these three recordings very much brought me back to my old studio at Rolling Knoll, where I was constantly exploring and experimenting with improvisational ideas, at all hours of the night and day. I seem to remember that these pieces were laid down on a rainy February day, which made the Grey Anthelion descriptor appropriate. \n\n\n\nThe first piece bears a lot of similarity to the doom and drone records I was listening to at that time, and also certain recordings I'd made with David Tagg as part of our VCV & Viking Destroyer catalogues. It is a rippling cascade of Electro Harmonix distortion and open-tuning resonance, and one of the heaviest guitar pieces I've issued in some time. \n\n\n\nThe second piece recalls some of the Eight Thousander album, with an open-air microphone setup placed close to the fuzzy speaker of my Lowrey \"Magic Genie\" organ. At that time, I was running odd setups where the microphone would be routed through a looper and other effects before it ended up on the tape, which combined with the non-direct signal input to create a warm haze of texture, soft noise and strange spaces. The same configuration can be heard on the Blue Wheatfield album, and a couple tracks on Nine Billion Names. \n\n\n\nThe third piece is the most elaborate and lengthy, at almost 43 minutes. It was created using a live \"performance\" of playing back a four-track cassette filled with four separate recordings of microphone feedback, which were prepared as they were laid to tape with realtime pitch shifting and FX saturations. In this way, I was able to turn the four-track recorder into a four-voice synthesizer, and after routing the machine through the aforementioned looper, reverbs and delays, the same one side of a prepared tape could yield hours of different and unique output possibilities. I repeated this process while working on the Whitehope album years later, and performed Whitehope live with it numerous times as well. \n\n\n\nAltogether, Grey Anthelion echoes a time when I was happily lost at sea, occasionally stopping at nameless unmapped islands, before moving on to chase the unreachable line on the horizon once more. Many recordings were made, such as these, which focused on the process rather than the result. The trip, but never the destination. This method of working and thinking has stayed with me ever since, and the further out I go into the borderlands of Deep Earth, the forests of Verdant Acre and the cosmic void of the Workingman's Drone series, the more fascinating these dusty diamonds become. Finding and releasing Grey Anthelion has inspired me to resume the Anthelion concept, and for the first time in ten years, new Anthelion variations are underway.",

      "about": "Following the retrieval of the long-lost Grey Anthelion album, as well as the reinstating of the 2008 Anthelion sessions (White / Night / Red / Black), I came to realize that there was still much left to say using this sound-assembly approach I conceived over a decade ago. Anthelion recordings are one of many attempts to distill elemental and atmospheric sound into something vaguely musical, or at the very least tonal, while also rendering any potential instrumental voices down to texture and faux-environmental surroundings. So, with the advent of the 2019 Spring season, I felt it appropriate to renew, revise and reiterate with Anthelion once (or actually twice) more. \n\n\n\nGreen Anthelion is a summation of so many diverse sound sources, location recordings and captured events. Strange experiments such as recording piezoelectric microphone feedback through a car stereo system while driving, melt into compound field recordings of lawnmowers, public parks, grassy play dates in sunny suburban neighborhoods, swingsets and open studio windows. The somewhat signature element of Anthelion recordings - the noted presence of windchimes - recurs here, albeit beneath a haze of ring modulated speech and psychedelic arrays of outdoor sounds. Green Anthelion is an attempt at representing the sound of Spring rebirth, overgrowth, blooming. A blind and naive renewal of life from the soggy leaf debris of Autumn's death, and a deep listening experience suited to both headphones and open-air speaker configurations, especially those with sub-bass output range. A green sonic bath, a Stravinskian rain summoning ritual to drive away the Winter.",

      "about": "Six massive, vulgar and megalithic pieces that would appeal to folks who enjoyed Porch, Porous Variations or the recent Borley Rectory set. Very heavy and untamed at times, but also very diverse and hopefully well-rounded in terms of textures and general moods. A lot of experimentation happening on this record, using synths, drum machines, feedback, AM radio signals and turntables to achieve tonalities, then augmented with deep sub-basslines or guitars. The material is still totally beatless, however through the use of various tremolos and delays, some tracks become quite rhythmic in their own way. A very obtuse and different album, but a very fun one that will likely lead to bigger and better ideas.",

With the comfort of basement walls fortifying the White Pillar Workshop against the bitter cold of the season, I've delved deeply once again into extensive synaesthetic wandering/wondering to fashion two Winter installments in the Anthelion series.\n\n\n\nSilver and Gold, in this instance, represent a summation of many different aspects and ideas, culminating in Anthelion recordings: advancement of age, metals buried deep beneath the Earth's crust, Winter holiday traditionalism, cool tones gradually giving way to warm tones, a frozen lake slowly melted in a golden bath of sunrise.\n\n\n\nSilver Anthelion is a deification of the bleak and isolated core of Winter - snowfall, snowstorms, blasts of freezing wind through crackling dead branches in Ohio woods, ice crusted on every open surface and far below the surface, an alchemical transfiguration of Vivaldi's \"Winter\" reduced to nothing more than a vibration that sleeps beneath the layers and layers of cold, echoing a land frozen in submission until the senile and brazen Old Man releases his clutches like a vampire burning up in the sunlight.\n\n\n\nGolden Anthelion brings back a wall of warmth in spite of the inhospitalities of the outdoors. Gusts of cold air are heard distantly from the vantage point of a chimney, filled with the defiant glow of a log fire. Space heaters of all kinds hum and buzz in the unison of a drone that deifies comfort and calm. Distantly, the overtones of a happy Christmas morning are woven into the fabric of the collage like a blanket. Sunshine begins the slow melt of icicles hanging above windows, as metallic heat dissolves Winter in a pleasant haze.\n\n\n\nWith the completion of Silver and Golden Anthelion, the four-cycle year of recordings is now over.

      "about": "\"...the sunburned hands I used to hold...\"\n\n\n\nWith the weather once again turning, new Anthelion recordings have been underway, rumbling the walls of the basement Workshop, surrounded by cold wet dirt and dead leaves. For Autumn's captivating months, I opted to assemble a number of different aspects of the season for inclusion here, as if I were designing a perfume or blending a paint. Composting together several different recordings of leaves, wind, early afternoon days of muted sunshine and chilly hints of Winter approaching, and calm purple nights under skeletal valley trees as we stand next to a metal windchime on the back porch, remembering Spring. Buried beneath all of these things is a heavily processed recording of an old standard that always comes to mind during this time, reduced to a ghost of a vibration, echoing out some long forgotten horn fanfare from a browning Appalachian forest. All of this coalesces together within the lines of the Anthelion recording discipline - to take full advantage of FX processing, multitrack recording, lossy recording formats and generative systems, in order to generate sound that is melodic from atonal provenance, and to transfigure any melodious sound sources into considered texture and tone. Both Umber and Violet Anthelion live up to this ethos beautifully, and could be just the thing you need to put you in the right seasonal mindset, aware of the present moment, and artificially suspending it before the weather turns once more... \n\n\n\nThese recordings in particular would be recommended to fans of albums such as Silver Horns Heard Over Green Hills and the Naked Sound series. Umber was particularly inspired by the GAS recordings Konigsforst and Oktember, and Violet was inspired by both Irv Teibel's Tintinnabulation (in three speeds) and Richard Chartier's work.",

      "about": "Created as a both an experiment in processed audio and as a celebratory document of my daughter Penelope's arrival into this world. After Penelope was born, I set out to find as many songs as possible, recorded by anyone in any genre or era, that used the word \"baby\" or \"babies\" in its title. After a couple weeks of compiling I ended up with almost 200 different songs, and sat down to build an overwhelming thirty-minute wall of sound by combining every single one. The claustrophobic and seemingly endless nature of the piece seemed to perfectly echo the euphoria I felt the minute she was born, although if I'm honest, nothing else could truly replicate that sensation. Never quite content to play with something only once, I sat down with the final sound collage again and this time worked it into a more inert ambient state. This second piece ended up over the forty-minute mark and finds the source sound reduced to a simple warm drone pulse. Fittingly, this piece is titled one minute after Penelope's time of birth, once again echoing the feeling of having my emotions and energy flushed out of me in less than one minute, brought on by the simple sound of her voice, the touch of her hand and the weight of the word \"father\".",

      "about": "\"...the sunburned hands I used to hold...\"\n\n\n\nWith the weather once again turning, new Anthelion recordings have been underway, rumbling the walls of the basement Workshop, surrounded by cold wet dirt and dead leaves. For Autumn's captivating months, I opted to assemble a number of different aspects of the season for inclusion here, as if I were designing a perfume or blending a paint. Composting together several different recordings of leaves, wind, early afternoon days of muted sunshine and chilly hints of Winter approaching, and calm purple nights under skeletal valley trees as we stand next to a metal windchime on the back porch, remembering Spring. Buried beneath all of these things is a heavily processed recording of an old standard that always comes to mind during this time, reduced to a ghost of a vibration, echoing out some long forgotten horn fanfare from a browning Appalachian forest. All of this coalesces together within the lines of the Anthelion recording discipline - to take full advantage of FX processing, multitrack recording, lossy recording formats and generative systems, in order to generate sound that is melodic from atonal provenance, and to transfigure any melodious sound sources into considered texture and tone. Both Umber and Violet Anthelion live up to this ethos beautifully, and could be just the thing you need to put you in the right seasonal mindset, aware of the present moment, and artificially suspending it before the weather turns once more... \n\n\n\nThese recordings in particular would be recommended to fans of albums such as Silver Horns Heard Over Green Hills and the Naked Sound series. Umber was particularly inspired by the GAS recordings Konigsforst and Oktember, and Violet was inspired by both Irv Teibel's Tintinnabulation (in three speeds) and Richard Chartier's work.",

      "about": "The end of Summertime always makes me feel happy and sad at the same time, knowing that the beautifully unfolding Autumn season is fast approaching with its cycles of death carried on cool winds. What will remain after Summer's Bradburian green lawns finally retreat is an orange-brown burnt cinnamon dusk season, filled with spices and corduroy and the drunken prosperity of the year's harvests. The change of seasons and the shift of elements has always been very tied to my music, conceptually and synaesthetically, and so it follows that I should offer up a recording to celebrate Autumn's return. This one is Foxfur, a very long and very pretty atmospheric drone suite that musically follows up on already established recordings such as Autumn Soil Feedback, Ultraboreal, Compost Springtime Shed, Forcefield and Black Curtain Warmth (and if you enjoy this one, you should definitely go investigate those!) - a musical cornucopia of gentle humming chords and grain silos of reverb set atop a glowing bronze skyline. Perfect for your low key evenings or early mornings as you bid the harsh mistress of Summer goodbye for one more year.",

      "about": "Train Line Triads is a record I've wanted to make ever since Sophia and I moved into our new home a year ago in April 2011. Months of staying up into the late hours and hearing the distant, ghostlike echoes of the local trains passing through the layers of forest and residence toward our home only served to inspire me. I'd usually hear the trains while I was reading in bed, so naturally I began to associate the sound with a calm, meditative state. I didn't expect to have any time to record anything new quite so soon after my daughter Penelope was born on April 10th, however hours of sleep deprivation and a very loose recording setup enabled Train Line Triads to manifest itself in my daughter's first two weeks of life. These three songs are meandering meditations that come from nowhere and go nowhere, just like the trains that seem to emerge and vanish from the ether in those early morning hours. Like many things that come to me only when I have been awake for 3 or 4 days straight, this album made total sense to the almost braindead composer making it, and in hindsight I think it captures some very interesting atmospheres that I might have otherwise erased in a more heightened state of awareness. If nothing else, this recording is a milestone for being the first recording I completed as a father.\n\n\n\n-Brian, April 29th, 2012",

Using guitars, bass, organ, and several other instruments in tandem with metal and wooden chimes on the porch in front of the studio window, with everything recorded into an extensive setup of dual-delays and live microphones. The result is an overwhelmingly organic and deeply textured set of drones and vague impressions of distantly recalled melodic movements, swaying tumultuously in and out of time with nature itself.\n\n\n\nA limited edition CD-R pressing was produced in September 2007 at Milieu Music, which has long since gone out of print and into obscurity. This is the first time Photoplay Music has been made available digitally in any format.",

      "about": "FROM THE LABEL, 2012: \"WR is happy to announce a new limited edition drone cassette by Brian Grainger titled âInvisible Frequencies From The Underground Chrome Monolithâ. This cassette features two massive long form drone pieces improvised entirely on Synthrotek gear (and a mixer). Invisible Frequencies is not a typical Brian Grainger release, rather, it is an excercise in self restraint and subtle improvisation. These two 20 minute plus tracks play out like monochromatic noise fields intercepted by some obscure piece of government equipment. A release for the Connoisseur!\" \n\n\n\nFROM THE MONO CASSETTE LINER NOTES, 2012: \"Based on intercepted transmissions originally broadcast from somewhere beneath the Alaskan ice in 1994-1995. Captured and translated via HAARP under the care of Dr. George Bennings and Dr. R.J. MacReady.\"\n\n\n\nFROM THE ARTIST, 2020: \"Invisible Frequencies was a somewhat commissioned work by and for Synthrotek (a modular synthesizer company) as an endorsement and proof of concept for some of their equipment - namely, their Nand drone synthesizer and their PT2399 delay unit. I was sent a prototype version of the Nand along with the delay box and proceeded to plan out two lengthy sessions of improvisation using only these two devices, plus a Mackie ProFX8 mixer. The sessions were recorded in mono deliberately, as WR offered me a platform for the release in the form of 42 chrome mono cassette tapes they found in a storage room. Musically, the two sessions move through some of my favorite \"phases\" of drone synthesis, with lots of very electrical humming and buzzing jagged modulation of the oscillators. As the Nand was without any sequencing, keeping the unit in tune and in relative alignment with itself was a bit more difficult, but helped to shape how I interacted with the machine to begin with. My influences for this tape were perhaps obvious: Eliane Radigue, Mika Vainio, Omit, Acre and Chris Watson, as well as a number of science-fiction paperbacks and films. Today, these single-synthesizer-voice approaches could be easily seen as a precursor to my approach to the third year of the Workingman's Drone series.\"",

The main idea was inspired by observing the alphabet, taking stock of letters that could be mirrored to either be the same letter, or produce another letter, which is where the unspeakable title came from. A written representation of the process of moving from two sides inward, toward a central point, which is what the music itself actually does. It's a very complex setup, which is why the album comes with notes (printed with the CD-R version, a PDF with the digital version) and I even put together a primitive text-graph-map for help navigating the piece itself. What you hear, however, outside of all the concepts and setups, is a very minimal drone record. Sometimes warm and washed out, sometimes bright and metallic. Even occasionally rumbling and subterranean. Definitely a work of different phases, best experienced in a dimly lit room, lying in bed, on painkillers, while you recover from dental work...",

      "about": "UPDATE FEBRUARY 2025: \"Starshield\" has been revisited for a remaster and an additional \"derivation\" mix to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the original release:  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/starshield-10th-anniversary-expanded-remaster\n\n\n\n Like a long exposure time on a photograph, Starshield is the musical accumulation of sonic vapors and gradual brightening. Almost completely sourced from a recording of the human voice speaking a specific phrase, the sound you're hearing is incidental to the vibration you're feeling. Dozens of layers of carefully deliberate processing and strategic movements through equalization present a piece of music that is more harmony than chord, more reverberation and echo than source, more meditation than map. \n\n\n\nIntended for looped playback at both very low and very high decibel levels, preferably in an open-air environment where the sound is permitted to color the shape of a room, rather than confined to headphones.",

      "about": "The album Brian started recording as far back as the Eight Thousander sessions, and also the record he has always intended to be written especially for Second Sun. Musically it covers alot of guitar-heavy territories...an epic 70 minute record that cycles through somber drone-beds, backwoods acoustics, gigantic distorted slabs of doom and beautiful bent melodies looping forever. Occasionally through the haze you can make out organs, basslines and field recordings that echo the album's cozy home cover art. This is Brian's first full-length at SSR under his own name, and as such we'd like to consider it his first proper solo album here, with unified concepts of art, sound, memories, locations and numbers all planted firmly in place. It's a very sad record that sounds like it's trying to find its way home again, even though it already knows that place no longer exists. Perfect listening for the advent of Autumn.",

Forcefield could possibly even be considered an Autumn version of something like Compost Springtime Shed, and where that album moved in pastoral greens and blues, Forcefield saturates your brain with spiced browns and burnt oranges. Packaged in a black cardstock folder with gold ink stamping inside a clear plastic sleeve for the first 20 copies, with another 30 copies available in an orange paper sleeve with stamped kraft cardstock inserts.",

      "about": "We walked home, through spring valleys and rolling winter knolls,\n\nthrough the hot sadness of summer and the electric death of autumn.\n\nUnder massive canopies of green and beside burnt stone streets, we\n\ntread on, toward an ambiguous end with all the confidence of the\n\nuniverse at our heels. We passed by dusty antique constructs of bark\n\nand sap that loomed above our heads like ancient giants, long since\n\nasleep or dead or petrified under the warm gaze of the sun. We heard\n\nbirds sing, felt fog pass, counted clouds until there were no more\n\nclouds left, at which point we started counting stars. Beneath days of\n\nbronze and nights of soft lavender we walked and slept. We ate of the\n\nearth, plucking buxom red apples and other fruits from the wild\n\novergrown cornucopia that surrounded us. We drank of the earth,\n\nsavoring cold mountain streams that Pan himself might have distilled\n\ninto wine, eons ago. Yes, we were here, we were ourselves, and we were happy. Upon clearing the gargantuan wood, we discovered an equally massive clearing. Miles of flower covered flatlands lay submissively out before us, sleeping and still unaware of our steps. We walked home, hand in hand, ear to ear, babbling mouth to babbling mouth. Toward other forests we strode, without fear and without care. Shining endless forests of alien metal and geometries. They called out to us from across the great expanse in their angular chrome tongues. Onward we trod, ebbing slowly toward the silver Gods with so much unseen magnetism, like petals in a stream. The skies slowly changed from a bonnet blue to an alabaster white, and as we arrived in the Old Gods' summit, there was no wind either. It was as if the entire outdoors gave way to a gigantic laboratory where we were only microbes. The tall sentinels greeted us indifferently with glares of white light on reflective metal. Deeper we pushed into the abyssal maze of perfect angles and calculated dimensions, still aware of our purpose. After what seemed like years inside the huge profane complex, we found a small still pond, almost invisible among the mirrored walls and ceilings. We remembered the small dry node we kept from our time in the antediluvian forest, and placed it in the small body of water. Quickly the liquid began to bubble and fizz, as if we had enacted some chemical reaction. Sprawling organic growth shot out of the pool, taking hold in every corner and inflating itself a hundred fold. A bright reddish brown arm of roots and wooden muscle reached up from the floor to burst through the aluminum overhang we were crouched inside. Sunlight, pure and bright yellow, poured into the room, revealing otherwise invisible gridlike indentations along the walls of the interior. In a flood of green, the powerful tree burst with soft\n\nleaves, hundreds of them. For the next half hour, everything slowed\n\ndown to a near silence as weight settled, spaces gave way to\n\nexpansion, until in one elongated sigh, the growth paused. We looked\n\nat each other, smiled, just now realizing we were holding hands, and\n\nbegan to climb up, up, up to our warm wooden hollow in the sky.",

      "about": "From the Wil-Ru Records press release, 2011: \"In honor of Brian Graingerâs birthday today, we are releasing a very special limited edition cassette titled White Demon Disco. This marks our first rock release from Brian, and from the sound of it, we hope to see a lot more of this side of his music in the future. White Demon Disco is a six track album of lo-fi drone/kraut rock, very much inline with Brianâs recent âHighschool Guitarâ LP that was released earlier this year at Attacknine Records. For fans of sonic exploration. This cassette is limited to 40 copies, so grab them while you can!\" \n\n\n\nFrom the author, 2020: These six tracks were laid to crusty tape during the years-long writing and recording sessions for Summer's Parting Ways, which is (as of this moment) actually at the pressing plant, being prepped for an Autumn 2020 release. They are all much heavier and more menacing than the SPW material, and almost represent a pocket-universe of their own, where Black Sabbath remain the Masters of Reality, where the Neu! LP sits in everyone's homes instead of Dark Side of the Moon, where Morrison, Kaufman and Hendrix are alive still, and Mike Love was the one who went LSD-bonkers while Brian Wilson fired him for bad behavior, eventually going on to write \"Whine On, You Lazy Bastard\" in honor of the man. In that world, White Demon Disco is my Eight Thousander, a single step on the way up to the top of the guitar-slung mountains. Raw, loud, dissonant, held together only by the sheer weight of the groove pulling the tangled crooked pieces down to the Earth.",

It lies empty and abandoned, its crew jettisoned long ago in vain hopes for shelter or rescue. What made them leave is unknown and unimportant. The silvery shipâs pristine structure remains perfect and preserved, gleaming silently in bluish sadness. These three recordings are the documentation of a signal being broadcast at this vessel, where someday, its internal computer systems might intercept and respond, returning home with an answer. Until then, it shall know no breath, no movement, no interruption, no sound and no soil. Earth is an invisible echo, buried beneath an aching, eternal night.",

The new album by BRIAN GRAINGER, featuring guest collaborations by Install alumni David Tagg, Peter Wright, Shinobu Nemoto, Acreil, Jason Adams and Millipede. A mammoth set of six songs about failure, recorded in a violent effort to break down the walls of some severe writer's block Brian was experiencing in the early 2010 year. Make no mistake, OBT is quite possibly the heaviest, angriest music Brian has ever released. Considering the source of the material, the collaborators make OBT a surprisingly varied album, and one not to be missed for longtime fans of the Install repertoire.",

This collection is just as much a document of my home with Sophia at that time, as it is a musical venture.

      "about": "\"With âDiamond Tears on Slateâ, Brian channels a dark and bleak spirit in to his work. At times sounding like the distant chants of weird rituals from the occult, this mutated album of twisted drone is some of Brianâs finest music to date. Heavily grained textures underlined with deep bass progressions are where we head first with opener âEmpyrean Crownâ whilst âRoman Emerald Orgiesâ starts with waves of reverberated guitar licks before descending into a blackened dirge; this album will drain you in the best possibly sense of the word.\"\n\n-Dead Pilot Records, 2010\n\n\n\n\"Our man Brian makes his album label debut on Dead Pilot following an appearance on the Drone Poets CD a short while back... Oh shit! A few minutes in and black clouds are shifting towards me and sucking me up into a vortex. Man he's heading straight into the zone here, no messing. I gotta say this may well be the darkest I've heard Mr Grainger go, sans maybe some of the VCV stuff perhaps. Oh yeah I'm feeling this one, it even recalls some black metal soundscapes when some of those guys head into a more dark ambient mode. The textures become more metallic and feel a little more tangible then >>> Shit!!! A big blast of bass action lifts 'Empyrean Crown' entirely into new levels of goodness. 'Open Jaws Lined With Jagged Glass Teeth' slows down the intensity with a more reflective mood and again deep bass underpins sweeping howls and brain massaging tones. 'Diamond Tears On Slate' creates cavernous space with elements of isolationist ambient that recalls Thomas Koner's early works. Just as I'm blissing out, 'Roman Emerald Orgies' kicks my ass with some noisy distorted guitar sounds and then steadily plunges into blackened realms. Closer 'Pagan Horn' ends the set with murky cinematics. Recommended!\"\n\n-Ant @ Norman Records, 2010\n\n\n\n\"Goddamn, this guy never stops. Right after his release THE LONELINESS OF EMPTY ROADS as Milieu, he puts out this 75 minute monolith on DEAD PILOT, and heâs ALREADY got two more out, his âheaviest record yetâ called One Bleak Try and ICEPAK, a Christmas EP on Bandcamp.\n\nI guess we should be so lucky. Brian Grainger is one of the few dudes today that makes truly high quality tunes. Not the imitation shit. This is the real deal right here. And we get basically as much of it as we can handle.\n\nDiamond Tears On Slate is some of his best work to date. Only 5 tracks but clocking in at 1 hour and 15 minutes, this is a massive slab of gorgeous static, starting out as almost the complete opposite of Empty Roads. This isnât depressing or desolate, itâs beauty in its purest form, warm & inviting. Itâs super lush, an infinite warehouse lined with golden grass & dust, drones that fill the space with closed eyes and half smiles, even the track âOpen Jaws Lined With Jagged Glass Teethâ is a slow soaring euphoric trip over the mossy plains.\n\nBut it takes a turn towards the dark side on the title track, a minimal midnight creep with ghostly rumbles in the background. Then it gets murky as hell, like a swampy Italo-disco horror soundtrack slowed wayyy down and drugged out on morphine all while keeping a certain strange beauty hovering around. The final 13 minute track evens things out a bit, brings it out of the cave with waves of bubbling distortion that fade into the ocean.\n\nBrian Grainger worked some drone voodoo into Diamond Tears, equal parts bliss & beast that mysteriously starts up again as soon as itâs over. Obviously a necessity to your neverending Grainger shelf, or the perfect one to let you in on the secret of his wondrous drones.\"\n\n-Anti-Gravity Bunny, 2010\n\n\n\nIssued on a limited edition CD-R pressing of 100 hand-numbered copies at UK label Dead Pilot Records in 2010, and now out of print. On the physical pressing, the album titles were printed in the correct order but the tracks were not ordered correctly on the CD-R - the order and titling presented here is correct. This album is conceptually intended as part two of a two-part set, with part one being White Kingdoms.",

After some time and consideration, a CD-R release became the focus, and for that iteration of the release edits were made and additional tracks compiled. The five track version of the album was issued on October 25th, 2010 on a hand-numbered limited edition of 100. The first 20 copies came with a special 3\" CD-R containing one of the two original tracks presented here. This edition has been out of print for some time now, and Dead Pilot Records has since closed, sadly. For the first time ever, the original \"cassette version\" of this album is now available for your consideration and consumption.",

      "about": "The first recording session undertaken specifically for a birthday gift to David Tagg. David turned 25 in 2007, and around this time we were deeply fond of very experimental recordings and sound-collage, and we would have been running the INSTALL label for almost a year by this point. As such, this session yielded very two strange fourtrack cassette sound-collages, wherein I can be heard wishing David a happy 25th birthday 25 times, and repeating the word 25 to an absurd degree. Instruments used included toy drums, accordion, harmonica, wind chimes, guitar, bass, and a massive amount of analog and digital live effects processing. Everything was improvised and layered very densely together, so that the final mix would be unique to the \"played\" mixer faders. The vocal ad libs and processing were inspired by Throbbing Gristle and early Beck records, and the claustrophobic improvisation was inspired by Birchville Cat Motel. As with future birthday recordings, a handmade sleeve was created and a CD-R was shipped off to Mr. Tagg after the recordings were completed.",

David turned 29 in 2011, and for the first time, due to my wife Sophia's pregnancy, I missed recording music in time for David's birthday. It wasn't until exactly 100 days after his birthday, in late December, that I was able to sit down and record this improvisation for him. Equipment used included guitar, Lowrey organ, AM radio and many different effects units, including the White Orchid, a custom-built distortion unit that I commissioned to be made for David's Xmas gift, not unlike my Hermione unit. Distance mic setups were used in addition to line-in recording, and once recording was complete, a special CD-R was hand assembled and shipped to David along with his White Orchid. \n\n\n\nAt the time of this writing, I also missed out on recording music for David's 30th birthday this year, thanks to my daughter Penny keeping me away from the studio quite frequently - however I did make up for it with a fantastic Goodiepal book that even I am envious of. Hopefully a 31st birthday recording session will happen in 2013.",

      "about": "The third recording session undertaken specifically for a birthday gift to David Tagg. David turned 27 in 2009, and around this time I was fond of very tonal, ambient drones like those present on Leaves Painted Purple or Translucent Forestation. Being a numbers-obsessive, specifically of threes, 27 was a wonderfully fun opportunity for me to write something around the number. Cubic Surfaces emerged from a very detailed/convoluted process that I cannot seem to recall completely now, but it included the creation of three thirty-minute pieces to coincide with 27 being a perfect cube (3x3x3). Everything was improvised in the key of D (for David) and used a system of 27 keyboard notes, played in groups of three, that themselves would repeat 27 times. In addition to this, all three pieces were engineered so that they could be played simultaneously without precise alignment of any kind, as evidenced in the fourth bonus track. Instruments for the session included a Lowrey organ and several delay, reverb and filter effects units. All music was laid directly to tape and edited for time on a computer in post. A special 2xCD-R set was assembled for David alone and mailed to him when the recordings were completed, and subsequently a very small number of promotional CD-R copies were sent out in Milieu Music orders for a short time, but these copies are excessively rare.",

As they have done in the past, Millipede and Brian Grainger have painstakingly recreated the sound of the ancient Hylian ethos. Dark riders seeking mystical metals, princesses with hidden powers, and a silent hero, unaware of his fate, setting out over fields of green, lava-crusted mounts, deep forests and bleak caverns, sword to the skies. Every detail is here, right down to the golden metal container that once imparted this same cosmic knowledge a full 25 years ago. Listener! Take up this cask of fragrant nostalgia and drink deeply, because as one wise sage once warned: \"It's dangerous to go alone. Take this...\"",

This release was issued on a micro-pressing of 30 copies, packaged in stickered clear plastic sleeves with hologram paper inserts, and quickly went out of print. It was released alongside Night Anthelion, a similarly presented album of drones and field recordings.",

Where Porous Variations was a very monochromatic and cleanly produced drone album, N.V. buckles and quivers under organic weight and heavy gravity, with spattering textures of grit and detritus filling the air around the music like so much dust. Clean sustained tonalities are traded for more angular sounds...guitars reduced to toxic vapors, organ and broken effects boxes coalesce into moss covered rock formations. Room microphone setups hum and buzz with compressor-abused acoustic claustrophobia. Noxious Variations is a colorful album of experimental sound and live improvisation that will take you places, if you let it.",

      "about": "Perhaps the strangest recording created during the Anthelion sessions in 2008 is Red Anthelion. This piece was an attempt to fulfill an idea that David Tagg and myself discussed heavily at the time - to create a convincing field recording of a realistic, however improbable, acoustic environment completely synthetically. Writing this now, almost five years later, I cannot fully recall the tools used or the processes employed to build Red Anthelion's windy spaces, however I do remember the idea in mind was a very vivid picture of a field filled with cherry trees, swaying in a heavy wind under a grey and overcast sky, with that sweet and sad scent in the air that you can only get right before a big thunderstorm.",

      "about": "Night Anthelion was released alongside White Anthelion in 2008, and contains a similarly presented but altogether different approach. While White Anthelion hung in the air with sub bass languor, Night Anthelion is earthy and filled with texture and electricity. Using a field recording of a deep and sleepy night in the Carolinian countryside as a backdrop, the album's four pieces coalesce in their humid fuzz and leave soft trails of dust behind their subtle shifts and movements. Lightweight night listening at its best, well suited to an open window and a cozy bed with an old paperback and the incense of nature in the air.",

      "about": "This is a raw, unedited and unaltered recording of a 13 year old cassette tape side. In 2000, I was in a band with three other friends, and we used to regularly rehearse in my father's house, which was in the actual middle of nowhere. He lived over a mile away from a single neighbor, in the deep country, right next to acres of overgrown swamps, on a plot of land that has remained in my family since sometime around the Civil War. \n\n\n\nLiving there with him was hard sometimes, especially at night - you'd walk outside and swear someone was watching. Additionally, every time my friends or my sister's friends would visit, they would inevitably experience some kind of sound oddity (disembodied voices from outside or elsewhere in the house, strange noises from within the swamp like a heartbeat) that left them never wanting to come back again. Occasionally, this activity would also include failing lights, spots of unusual cold or even glimpses of figures in your peripheral vision - although the latter could always be attributed to the mind making things up in a stressful situation.\n\n\n\nOn the night this tape was recorded, my band had just finished rehearsing and we were in prime prankster mode. Our drummer wanted to sleep on the couch, as he had to clock into work early the next day, and we were determined to mess with him. Me being the perpetual documentarian that I am, I decided it would be *extra* fun if we recorded it, so I set up a mic discreetly next to the sofa where he wouldn't see, and rolled tape. After a few minutes, we relented and went into my room on the other side of the house to let him sleep. A few minutes later, he bursts into my room scared out of his mind, telling us he felt cold for no reason, and that there were things tapping at the windows and he heard things moving the shades, even though the windows were shut and there was no one else in the house. We immediately assumed he was trying to get even with us, and then I realized we had taped the entire thing. We got the tape, brought it back and decided if anything actually happened, it would have been recorded. Sure enough, after you hear us leave the room, things start to bump the microphone and even stranger rhythmic pulses start to take the audio over. We were shocked.\n\n\n\nEven today, I have no explanation for what this really is. People might think I threw this together in a program, but rest assured every single person who was with me that night can verify that this tape is real. One of them even refused to ever come back to my father's place after this happened. It remains one of the weirdest experiences I've had in my lifetime of recording, and I thought the tape rip, along with the story of how it came to be, would make interesting night time discussion. As Ed Wood wrote in Plan 9 From Outer Space: \"Can you prove that it didn't happen?\"",
