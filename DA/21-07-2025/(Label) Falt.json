      "about": "\"The twenty-second of the second month, 2025\" is a collage-like electroacoustic composition. sound sources vary from field recordings to found sounds to everyday objects and to manipulated vinyl and radio samples. i have extensively been practicing sampling and my sample manipulation skills past few years, with sp-404mk2 sampler being my main tool for all of my work — alongside a daw, zoom recorder and record player of course.\n\n\n\nmiska lamberg is a self-taught sound artist, field recordist and musician. listening and silence are the essential foundations of their art, through which they seek to interpret and discover the potential of sound material in an artistic context.  \n\n\n\nmiskalamberg.univer.se\n\n  miskalamberg.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n special thanks to roosa saarni, iida nikander & tuikku leinonen",

      "about": "To purchase this album on cassette please head over to  epilepticmedia.bandcamp.com/album/fairly-used\n\n\n\n For the audiovisual show Fair Use, developed and performed by Nicolussi in 2024,  obsolete media and abandoned data carriers such as Mini DV, cassettes and Dictaphone tapes were highlighted. Fair Use features an experimental film projection edited and processed from found footage as well as a musical improvisation composed in real time. During the performance the artist is hidden behind a translucent projection surface, blurring the relationship between nostalgia and reality. Fair Use opens a wide range of possible interpretations and questions with borrowed originality, pirating in artistic creation and cautious handling/misuse of sensitive data as central themes. For the EP Fairly Used recordings of rehearsals and live performances were edited and rearranged into complete tracks. The base material was recorded while rehearsing in Vienna and while performing at FLUCC in Vienna and KAPU in Linz. \n\n\n\n“A few years ago, when I started to collect the first analog Dictaphones running on micro cassettes to resample my sound designs in a lo-fi manner, I was ripped off regularly. People (knowingly) sold their unusable trash claiming that it still works. Whenever I threw out the Dictaphones I could not fix, I would keep the precious cassettes of course. Lucky enough to also score some working voice recorders, I realized that most of the worn-out tapes people passed on to me to make their offer bearable for their guilty conscience still had some audio recorded. That’s what you get, I guess. Over the years I grew a chaotic archive of obsolete media carrying different kinds of data. Lawyers recording their cases, plumbers accidentally recording themselves on the way to a client, kids reading jokes to their friends, the answering machine of a dentist, two lovers sending back and forth a micro cassette with cheesy poems they recorded – you name it. I continued to unearth eerie, secret, intimate, obscure and interesting recordings not meant for my ears nor for a wider audience. While incorporating these snippets into live performances, productions and improvisations, ethical questions began to rise, and I learned to treat this delicate information with the respect necessary. It’s uncertain where this interest leads to in the future. For sure it took me to some strange places already – with this collection of tracks I’d like to share some of them.” - Nicolussi\n\n\n\nNicolussi performs in numerous projects, composes for theater and film and co-runs the cassette label Epileptic Media. Analog and digital systems of chance, processed field recordings and everyday noises form the basis for his heavily manipulated sound designs. He released on various labels including Objects & Sounds, Abhorrent A.D., Beach Buddies Records, Interstellar Recordings and A.T.C. Records.   \n\n\n\nnicolussi.bandcamp.com\n\n  soundcloud.com/nicolussi",

The title, ‘Rose, new rose is’ is a homophonic corruption of the phrase ‘rose neurosis’ contained in the aleatory poetry—in the manner of Jackson Mac Low—that occurs in the work. It also sends a nod and a wink to Angelus Silesius’ ‘The rose is without why: it blooms because it blooms,’ and Gertrude Stein’s ‘A rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.’ \n\n\n\nian-andrews.org\n\n  ianandrews.bandcamp.com",

      "about": "In July 2021, as part of the ESSE festival in the island of Seurasaari, Helsinki, musician Lauri Hyvärinen and poet/sound artist Juha Rautio performed four one hour improvisations in various natural locations. Using small battery powered electronics, an electric guitar, a typewriter, a dictaphone, a cassette player and voice, their intention was to experiment with the impact of duration, repetition and natural environmental sounds on their performance. In addition, the duo sought to research the balance between text and sound – both conceptually (the effect of sound on text/cognition), and practically (the process of writing as a sound source, and voice as an instrument). After the fact, three fixed pieces were composed by layering different elements of the recordings using a dogmatic but intuitive approach.\n\n\n\nLauri Hyvärinen: electric guitar, electronics, cassette player, objects\n\nJuha Rautio: typewriter, dictaphone, diy synth, voice \n\n\n\nlaurihyvarinen.com\n\n  laurihyvarinen.bandcamp.com\n\n  juharautio.com\n\n\n\n Photography by Nick Storring",

      "about": "Ever since I started moving away from using a lot of processing and synthetic sounds in my work, and sticking to acoustic/ electromechanical instrumentation, I've been fascinated by different idiosyncratic ways to record and amplify sound.\n\n\n\nAround 2019 I became fascinated with the possibilities of humbucker pickups, particularly the prefabricated ones designed to go into the sound holes of acoustic guitars. After purchasing one, I discovered that they can variously serve as weird and unpredictable contact mics, or amplify vibrations directly adjacent to them, and even act as a means to strike, or \"bow\" objects (especially with a little rosin!) I started by composing the last piece on this collection, but that simply did not satisfy my curiosity, as their strange behaviour with ferromagnetic objects and instruments excited me a lot. In addition to collecting various compatible materials and playing them in my home studio, as the pandemic hit, I started bringing them and my field recorder on my daily walks. Using a battery of mallets, eBows, and bows, I would capture performance field recordings playing various public structures I would encounter: railings, signs, sculptures, fences, cabling, and bridges. In one instance, I even transduced humbucker recordings I had made at home through a resonant sculpture in my neighbourhood, treating it as a sort of weird plate reverb. Later, a certain pedestrian bridge (captured with humbuckers, contact condenser mics and geophone) became the subject of an extended piece released by Seth Graham's Avant Lard imprint, \"Sleepwalking Through Lambton Woods.\"\n\n\n\nThose familiar with my work will notice that \"Sleepwalking\" and the pieces collected here deviate audibly from my other output, yet for me they share a similar underlying spirit. I have continued to employ these approaches both in recording and performance. \n\n\n\nNick Storring, January 2025",

      "about": "Percipient – Outre-exotica (2024)\n\n\n\n[English below]\n\n\n\nCe projet est né d'une voix entendue dans un rêve. La voix d'un ami avec qui j'ai formé mon premier groupe juste après le lycée et qui s'est suicidé avant d'avoir 45 ans. Dans ce rêve, il me rendait visite alors que je jouais dans un autre groupe. J'étais content de le revoir et j'essayais de le présenter aux autres et de lui choisir un instrument mais je sentais qu'il était mal à l'aise, il m'expliquait calmement pourquoi ce n'était pas possible mais je tapais trop fort sur la batterie, le studio de répétition s'était rempli de gens que nous ne connaissions pas pour la plupart. Il me murmurait quelque chose mais je le voyais bien s'ennuyer au fond de la salle.\n\n\n\nLe poltergeist est par essence une entité non physique solitaire, égarée entre le néant qui ne l'a pas encore absorbé et le semblant de vie qui anime les morts de l'inventeur Canterel sous l'effet de sa résurrectine (Locus Solus, Raymond Roussel, 1914). Ces âmes esseulées reprennent et réapprennent une forme de collectif animé par la musique.\n\nLa typtologie s'intéresse à la communication avec les morts qui se résume à des coups frappés, un son bref, et primaire. Lorsque Katia joue une note étrange, fuyante, dissoute sur son piano (Le masque du démon, Mario Bava, 1960, cf le précédent album de Percipient, The Griffin Wasn't Painted Like That, Mima Kass, 2023) c'est l'esprit de son double maléfique, Asa, qui se manifeste en lui dérobant l'attaque de cette note et en troublant son timbre. Peut-être l'emporte-t-elle pour en faire quelque chose de l'autre côté, pour l'utiliser dans une musique d'outre-tombe.\n\nDepuis la grande époque du spiritisme au XIXème siècle, les coups du poltergeist ont été appelés raps, ironique lorsqu'on sait à quel pan énorme de la musique produite actuellement cela fait référence. Le monde de l'au-delà, du moins dans le rapport que nous entretenons avec lui, est a fortiori exotique, c'est l'exotique ultime, l'écrivain Fernand Combet parlait de « l'excursion dominicale aux sables mouvants » dans son Schrumm Schrumm. avec tout l'imaginaire lié au voyage qui lui est associé, voyage dont nous ne revenons pas.\n\n\n\nAvec cet album, Percipient propose un ensemble de morceaux d'outre-exotica, moins une muzak qui serait produite par un groupe de musiciens trépassés que l'hypothèse d'une musique qui aurait outrepassé la barrière entre mort et vie, la trace de ce qu'il en resterait, de ce qui nous demeurerait entendable. Les timbres flottent sans ancrage à des matériaux, à concurrence de bruits divers, rémanents, ectoplasmiques, isolés ou enchaînés, désolés ou traînant leurs chaînes. Les itérations ont perdu leur caractère de rythme ou de pulsation, la distance reste l'élément tangible, si l'on peut dire, l'objet musical, sur lequel s'appuie cet ensemble. D'autres éléments de composition interviennent : l'inanité et l'évanescence de la touche pour poursuivre une vaine mélodie, la dérobade des attaques, l'aridité fluide dont le pendant pictural serait (à nouveau dans un projet Percipient) le tableau de Zweik représentant l'enfer dans L'aldilà (Lucio Fulci, 1981).\n\n\n\nEn adoptant le point de vue de l'autre, de l'outre, au-delà du possible renversement des valeurs (la musique reléguée en arrière-plan au profit de sons parasites), c'est encore une fois un changement de parallaxe qui se manifeste ici, dans le rapport à la construction musicale mais aussi au genre, l'exotica, dont Martin Denny est sans doute le musicien le plus emblématique. Si Throbbing Gristle avait coutume de diffuser quelques-uns de ses morceaux avant d'entrer en scène c'est peut-être moins pour préparer à un contraste radical avec leur musique (hard listening contre easy listening) que pour faire écho à une pratique se référant au paysage sonore, à l'acousmatique dans le périmètre « pop » et à la tension entre concret et artificiel. Cet album tente de concevoir de l'easy listening d'un monde inconnu dont la nature est le bruit, la dissonance, la violence, les ténèbres et dont l'écume ne se résume pas à des coups frappés.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the beginning, the voice of an old friend heard in a dream. He visits me while I rehearse with my band, although he died a few years ago, by suicide. I was happy to see him again and I tried to introduce him to the others and choose an instrument for him but I felt that he was uncomfortable, he calmly explained to me why it wasn't possible but I was hitting the drums too loud.\n\n\n\nThe poltergeist is in essence a solitary non-physical entity, lost between the nothingness which has not yet absorbed it and the semblance of life which animates the dead people of the inventor Canterel under the effect of the résurrectine (“Locus Solus”, Raymond Roussel , 1914). These lonely souls take up and relearn a form of collective animated by music.\n\nSince the heyday of spiritualism in the 19th century, poltergeist hits have been called raps, ironic when we know what a huge part of music currently produced this refers to. The world of afterlife, at least in the relationship we have with it, is a fortiori exotic, it is the ultimate exotic. With this album, Percipient offers a set of pieces of “outre-exotica” (“outer-exotica”), less a muzak which would be produced by a group of deceased musicians than the hypothesis of a music which would have crossed the barrier between death and life.\n\n\n\nTimbres are floating without anchoring to materials, in competition with various noises, persistent, ectoplasmic, isolated or chained, desolate or dragging their chains. The iterations have lost their character of rhythm or pulsation, distance remains the tangible element, so to speak, the musical object on which this ensemble is based. Other compositional elements intervene : the inanity and evanescence of the key to pursue a vain melody, the evasion of the attacks, the fluid aridity whose pictorial counterpart would be (again in a Percipient project) Zweik's painting representing hell in “L'aldilà” (Lucio Fulci, 1981).\n\n\n\nBy adopting this point of view, beyond the possible reversal of values ​​(the music relegated to the background in the benefit of parasitic sounds), it is once again a change of parallax which manifests itself here, in the relationship to musical construction but also to the genre, exotica, whose Martin Denny is undoubtedly the most emblematic musician. If Throbbing Gristle had the habit of broadcasting a few of his songs before going on stage, it was perhaps less to prepare for a radical contrast with their music (hard listening versus easy listening) than to echo a practice that referring to the soundscape, acousmatic approach in the “pop” scope and the tension between concrete and artificial. This album attempts to create easy listening from an unknown world whose nature is noise, dissonance, violence, darkness and whose foam is not limited to raps.\n\n\n\nConception et instruments : J-F Magre\n\n\n\nFace A :\n\n1 Entité non physique\n\n2 AirbParadis\n\n3 Lambada macabra\n\n4 Surf spirite\n\n\tEnfant de tcrxt, voix\n\n5 La fête continue au village fantôme\n\n\n\nFace B :\n\n1 Au fil du fluide universel\n\n2 Thanatophonie\n\n3 Résurrectine\n\n\tDave Brave, piano électrique\n\n\tNick Haudik, piano\n\n\tEnfant de tcrxt, voix\n\n\tUn inconnu dans la rue, flûte à coulisse\t\n\n4 Souvenirs du corps",

The theme and the sound of the album are focused on the vacant rooms that are within this facility, consisting of two 20-minute long soundscapes (one from each artist) that represent two different rooms within The Mosgrove Facility.\n\n\n\nConducive is an experimental sound artist from the UK who uses field recordings, audio manipulation and sound collages to create interesting and immersive noise pieces, against very subtle backdrops of minimalistic ambient music.\n\n\n\nManuel Carbone is an Italian sound artist and electroacoustic enthusiast, currently based in Berlin, with an abstract approach to composition through manipulation of field recording and found-objects, as well as synthesized sounds and tape loops, resulting in works that often range from musique-concréte to ambient and noise. \n\n\n\nconducivemusic.bandcamp.com\n\n  manuelcarbone.bandcamp.com",

Stored on digital and analogue formats, the sounds were then aligned and manipulated by use of VCR tracking systems and formulized EQ patterns. The procedure resulted in audio laced with phase-cancellation, frequency dropouts, flanging, spectrum overloads, hisses and pops.\n\n\n\nbroken end points is the second publication of the above process.\n\n\n\n@brandon.auger",

      "about": "The title for this album came to me in 2018 and was intended to be a cacophonous media installation heavily impacted by layered percussive sounds. That never quite came to be. Instead, the phrase traveled with me for a few years and took on several conceptual iterations -- by January 2021 the title became the thought-form for these two compositions--which have also changed in form several times over, becoming completely new along the way. The album grew out from a collection of improvised alto saxophone recording sessions during February of 2021. In the summer of 2021, I began to really compose with these recordings, piecing them together, cutting them up, layering the parts in ways that, at first, seemed totally out-of-sync with the melodic quality of the recordings. \n\n\n\nMonsoon hit that late summer in Tucson. It hit hard. The weeds grew waist high. I began to truly break down. Amidst a year and half of covid-19 social isolation, and being a father grappling with postpartum depression, and living away from many of my friends and family turned me inside out to say the least. I was a wreck. Shipwrecked. I was working feverishly on music but the compositions on this album went haywire, becoming something that didn't make sense. Frustrated and tired I shut them away. After September of '21 the tracks fell into disarray and then got buried in a few folders on a hard-drive where they sat until summer 2022 when I dug up the material anew after temporarily relocating to Flagstaff, Arizona. \n\n\n\nThe final version of this album is wildly different than where it all started. I began and completed the work in very different places and mental states. The second take on this album, which came together in Flagstaff was effortless, fun and brief--but intensely focused. \n\n\n\nThe imagery that Deluge Array summons is perplexing and yet the words flow off the english speaking tongue in a pleasant manner that seems at odds with the implications that the words themselves propose. While I am uncertain to what degree these recordings draw upon a vast and \n\ninterconnected collection of catastrophes, it was certainly the end of \n\nsomething.\n\n\n\nThe entire process of making this album felt as one single effort and energy that fulfilled a way of composing that I had been grasping towards for many years. Improvisation, songwriting and engineering have all been modes of working in sound that I have shifted my attention between for the last 20 years. \n\n\n\nIn recent years, and more directly on this album, those separate roles have become a unified expression and when I say that Deluge Array uses \n\nimprovised material I mean that to be the case from the performed acoustic soundings and melodies to the post-production arrangement and shaping of the aural as a whole movement.\n\n \n\nAs with anyone whose been writing music for a long time I am indebted to and deeply influenced by so many people and places that have illuminated my desires and challenged me to do better. Sometimes it is hard to distinguish where I end and someone else begins. Music is always an act of throwing oneself into an infinite now, a future-present of imagining and being with sounds as they pass over and through us in flexible time. \n\n\n\nSimultaneously though, music is an act of remembering something from before ourselves which allows the possibility of finding our place in the world through communing with another’s experiences. I don’t want to say anything else about this recording project, or state how it should be listened to, except to say that I have become more and more obsessed with trying to live inside of particular sounds, to burrow into them and then explode outwards from that inward spiral. Not just to hear or make a sound and then respond to it but also, and more intentionally, form the chamber in which the sound(s) eventually burst forth as.",

      "about": "Recorded between Buenos Aires and Newcastle 2021 - 2022. All sounds made in the mouths of A Courtis & J Posset captured and manipulated on microcassette.\n\n\n\nCourtis is one of the magical minds from Argentina's finest gravy-makers - Reynols. A guitar player by nature, today he trades his axe for grimy micro-cassette. Posset is a practicing dictaphone obsessive and dark double-thumb jammer. 'Micro-Glottis' is their second collaboration tape (check Balanceo y Vaiven on Vanity Publishing to hear the first) and composed entirely of gritty mouth hoiks and sloppy throat rupture all captured in the gloomy fidelity only a battered micro-cassette can muster. You can drink in the texture like it's like pepper in the eye. You can enjoy the brain-chicanes only breath, spittle and cracked teeth can provide. Because remember, Courtis Posset love you truly. \n\n\n\nvanitypublishing.bandcamp.com/album/balanceo-y-vaiven",

      "about": "\"Acoustic studies for sardinian bells\" is a sound investigation on 15 different sardinian bells. Cowbells are commonly used to quickly find the pack leaders of flocks, or to recognize the herd. Our work wants to bring out the hidden sound of the cowbells through timbre research, thus altering their strong identity. This research developed through extended techniques and aims for the redefinition of the instrument/object from a physical and conceptual point of view, thus obtaining unexpected sound results.\n\n\n\nGiacomo Salis/ Paolo Sanna: Sardinian bells \n\nMastered by Simon Balestrazzi",

      "about": "Played, recorded, sounds by: Anne-F Jacques/ Zhu Wenbo\n\nMixed by: Bardo Todol (Pablo Picco)\n\n\n\nAnne-F Jacques lives in Montreal, Québec. She started running crustacés tapes from 10 years ago, and in last year she stopped it and start a new label named presses précaires. I always love the sound she made, and we traded cassettes many times, shipping always taking too many days. We have not met each other though we have some common friends, and seems it might be difficult in the following a few years. \n\n\n\nIn the summer of 2021, we started talking about some possible collaborations. A collaboration between two tiny cassette label runners, I thought it could be an interesting idea. Then, I had the idea to invite two other cassette label runners friends to join this game. For each release, two persons contribute sound materials, the third person make some arrangement and mix (only using these materials), and the final product is released on the fourth person’s label. We change roles each time, so each person will act twice as a musician, once as a producer, and once as a publisher. And each person’s work will not be published on their own label. \n\n\n\nAnne-F suggested two friends. Pablo Picco is an Argentine musician who works under the name Bardo Todol, and has just started the label Bolinga Everest this year. I always imagine him as a passionate and mysterious father, living with his family in the campo faraway from any civilization (comment form Pablo: I live 50km away from a big city, not that far away from civilization!). And Christian Schiefner aka. Chemiefaserwerk, who has been running Falt for many years, actually we have traded cassettes before. He lives in France, but it seems he is from Berlin. So many people have released their stuff on Falt, including Pablo, Anne-F and myself. It is one of many secret links between us. \n\n\n\nWe spent days preparing, recording, mixing, asking for more materials, and thinking about a name for this project. One day, some old views came back to my mind. \n\n\n\nWhen I was a teenager, mid-1990s, broken and loose tape could always be found in cities, even in the country. They were ripped on wire, on tree, or hidden in some corners. After some breeze, the black tape was floating in the air. No one had any interest in knowing what was recorded on these tapes. Maybe English teaching or pirated pop songs, or private messages, sound diary, radio programs… \n\n\n\nAfter 2000s, this view became rare and then disappeared. But now I think, “floating tape” can be a good name for our collaborations. Tapes is soft, dirty and inconspicuous, but in another imaginary, these dirty tapes could be transported by wind, floating across the ocean, and reach to another un-met friend in an undetected way. \n\n\n\nThat is the whole story of “floating tape”. There will be four releases, sharing a same title but in different languages. The cassette you hold in your hand, released by Zoomin’ Night, is the second one. It was performed by Anne-F Jacques and Bardo Todol and mixed by Chemiefaserwerk. In the coming months, another 2 cassettes will come out in some other corners of the world. Hope you enjoy. \n\n\n\nZhu Wenbo, Nov, 2021, Beijing",

      "about": "«I leave to various future times, but not all, my garden of forking paths.»\n\n\n\n\"El jardin de los senderos que se bifurcan\", walking along one of the possible developments of J.L.Borges' novel, becomes not much a symbol as much as an interpreter of memory, catching only its bankruptcy and the contingency that stands at its roots.\n\n\n\nRecordings pretend to be memories organized through a process stretched between randomization and arbitrariness; some objects get to lay there, broken, unpredictable, hovering between past, present and potential, forming an imperfect system.\n\n\n\nIf any event has countless futures, each present holds innumerable pasts intersecting in that place and in that moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nComposed and recorded between April and May 2019 in Firenze, Siena and Copenhagen.\n\n\n\nMixed and Mastered at KU studio in Napoli by Renato Grieco.\n\nThank you Michał, Hein, Cosimo, Matteo, Renato for that spring.",

Free improvisation allows the duo to fathom the different possibilities offered by drums and percussions. The ultimate result of this approach is a general sense of balance. The percussion tradition of the free American and the post free European school, ,classical contemporary music, and popular music from around the world, are the foundations of the duo’s sound research.\n\n\n\nMatt Atkins is a sound artist and improvising musician from London whose principle focus is texture, looping, repetition and small sounds. His recent live work incorporates tape loops, cassette players, looping pedals, percussion and household objects, sometimes solo, often within duos or trios. He also runs the label Minimal Resource Manipulation as well as playing drums in the bands Crumbling Ghost, Newts and Smallgang.",

They already began discussing some way of collaborating, not simply by sharing sound recordings but in a more conceptual way.\n\n\n\nLeo suggested they compose a short piece each, with a concept in mind, and once complete would share the result with the other, but without explaining the concept behind the piece. Once this stage was complete, Simon had the idea to recompose the other's piece, with their own idea of what the concept was. They then shared the works, once again not explaining the concept behind the recomposition.\n\n\n\nThe works are almost complete, and it's your turn now. As the next step, please try and guess what the concepts are behind the works. The artists are curious to know the listeners' imaginations.",

      "about": "Five brief compositions about perception, memories and displacement. How the ear explores the sounds, how the latter is exposed to the mind, absorbed, distinguished and disclosed, confessed.\n\n\n\n\"U-Bahn, Chattery Kids, A Street Musician And A Vending Machine\" is made of sounds recorded on the subways of Berlin, on a journey from the new apartment to my office and back to the old house. These fragments are like candid photographs shot from the hip, developed, printed, assembled in an intricate collage and then re-photographed, redeveloped, reprinted.\n\n\n\nIn \"At Home On My Day Off And The Neighbour's Child Crying\" I'm alone in a familiar setting: silence, everything at its place, a peaceful environment.\n\nThe mind gets accidentally lost in a maze of dark thoughts, the inside restlessly remodels the surroundings, the ordinary becomes unfamiliar, an inexplicable discord, a child lament turns into a forlorn cry. Everything remains unresolved.\n\n\n\n\"Somebody Used To Live Here\" is a walk in the park, one hot summer afternoon. An abandoned area south of the Tempelhof district with an agglomeration of vacated cottages. Unbroken remembrances that do not belong to my past.\n\n\n\n\"Calm\" is an interlude. An accident, a sequencer left running for a few minutes. \n\n\n\nFinally \"Somebody Used To Live Here (Coda)\" is another walk in the park, in the same place as before. To my surprise, the abandoned cottages are demolished. Probably overnight. Debris and nature and no more memories.\n\n\n\nTools involved: Tascam DR-05, Sanyo MGR-701, Roland SP-404, Korg KAOSS Pad, Korg SQ-1, Waldorf Rocket synthesizer.\n\nEdited, mixed and mastered in Ableton. \n\n\n\ncravune.com\n\n  m.soundcloud.com/cravune\n\n  www.instagram.com/don_cravune\n\n  twitter.com/cravune\n\n  aporee.org/maps/work/user.php?u=2249",

Track 2 was recorded in Faenza and track 3 in Chianocco, both during “Humyth Tour” (October /November 2018).\n\n \n\nPaolo Sanna- Giacomo Salis’ duo is a percussion duo devoted to sound experimentation, it examines sound, silence, noise and employs extended tecniques and prepared set. Free improvisation allows the duo to fathom the different possibilities offered by drums and percussions. The ultimate result of this approach is a general sense of balance. The percussion tradition of the free American and the post free European school, classical contemporary music, and popular music from around the world are the foundations of the duo’s sound research.\n\n\n\nInfo / contacts: \n\n\n\nGiacomo Salis \ngiacomosalis@gmail.com\n\n  www.youtube.com/user/giacdrummer\n\n\n\n Paolo Sanna \npaolopercussion@gmail.com\n\n  paoperc.wix.com/paolosannaperc\n\n\n\n  www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSF6Hu82gzE&t=1s",

I use physical objects and their potential sounds as a way to explore queerness, human physicality, and self perception. As a queer and transgender person, I am constantly aware of my physical state. Whether this is anatomic or geographic, it plays a massive role in how I view myself and interact with those around me. This awareness constantly shifts my self perception which then informs those same surroundings in a new way. This happens constantly and endlessly. I am interested in creative improvisation because of the ability to create works using it that have this ever-evolving quality that is similar to my emotional and physical experiences.",

Escape Hatch is making a career of layering and mutating field recordings; AM Train (Midnight Circles, 2014) also received votes in our year-end tally. Bell Recordings (Ibid.) echoes with intense musicality. Evocative of October, the EP is direct and disconnected at once, a series of notes that serves as a tabula rasa, absorbing the projections of the listener.' Richard Allen",

      "about": "'Air Poems' is a titel proposed by Bagatela. He recorded the source sounds which started the composition of 'Through Thin Air' direct to a cassette and sended this tape to Falt. Chemiefaserwerk added others recordings to the 4-track tape and sended it back. This exchange was repeated. The results that both cassette composers have condensed from the material are presented in parts here.\n\n\n\nAR can mean Aller-Retour or Another Recording or Alles Richtig or a lot of other things (e.g. in portugese the word Ar translates to Air..) and is a new series which will be published infrequently via the Falt outlet. \n\n\n\n*Please note: The recordings Pedro has sourced from the initial exchanged cassette will be released on his own OTA label. The same master tape is the basis for the two tape releases.\n\n\n\nget the tape here:  ostresamigos.bandcamp.com/album/a-cornered-animal",

      "about": "recordings repeat on both sides*\n\n\n\neach of the four track is representative of one specific technique. \n\n\n\n-the first one is actually just a playback with a tape loop passing trough two recorders with some very small insert of real time recording and speeding up / slowing down variations. for this piece i used a nagra iv-sj and an akai gx260d (it can record 4 tracks over a 1/4 inch tape). the original texture prerecorded on the tape is realized recording a sample of the water on a piece of tape with a very high gain and a second piece of tape layering the one that touch the heads. what happens is that the \"regular\" recording is very very distorted and harsh (the tape was nearly destroyed). on the second layer there's this plot. the piece is recorded on a maxell 15-120 LH super metallo (0.5 mil polyester). the tape that was touching the heads is a scotch (1 mil polyester).\n\n\n\n-the second piece is realized with a collage of the wasted pieces of tape used for the fist piece. i had to record again the sound on a second tape because the collage was to fragile to be reproduced at this speed (15\"/s). i used a basf ferro LH. what you listen, actually, is the sound of the tape itself that crawls on the body of the machine (is running very fast) with a very close stereo microphone as well as the sound impressed on the tape (at the very end of the piece the microphone signal fade out and you can listen to the analog \"glitch\" as it is, alone). in this track the tape is played by the nagra iv-sj, which is actually my main instrument.\n\n\n\n-the third and the fourth pieces are realized recording a sample with a Sony WM-D6C, abusing the dolby noise reduction system (B-type and C-Type). to slow down the playback i used a yamaha mt 100 (just for the recording). the third track is recorded on a basf chrome extra II c60 (1990). this cassette was given to me by an old girlfriend of mine, angelica d'acierno, back in 2008. originally there was a recording of her babbling that her mother had done with an handy walkman when she was only a few months old. \n\n\n\n-in the fourth track i'm using a cassette loop realized from a tdk type I cassette. it was originally a pop record by lucio dalla. i bought it in a flea market.\n\n\n\ni bought my nagra recorder in december 2016, by a very kind gentleman who left me for a ridiculous amount, believing that I would make good use of it.\n\n\n\nthe akai was loaned to me by my mate giulio nocera, who in turn inherited it from an uncle who found him in the attic.\n\nthe sony recorder is a gift from my girlfriend federichina, as a graduation present. attila faravelli has put us in touch with a guy who owns several of them, all in excellent condition.\n\n\n\nthe yamaha was left to me, by usucapione, by my friend, pietro santangelo, back in 2012. this tool was my partner in many adventures. \n\nI bought the tapes from marco fuccio, a guy that lives in the countryside which is a fan of old electronics. he took a mountain of reels from an amateur radio that kept them maniacally. he has been recording radio shows with an old philips for 30 years. I deleted all the contents with a magnet.\n\n\n\ngiulio bought his revox b77 mkII from him in october 2015. it was an opportunity of great growth for me. \n\n\n\nRenato Grieco, September 2018 \n\n\n\nrongrieco.tumblr.com",

      "about": "'I realized that it can take other forms, others then the one imposed. Not just a section, but a circle or an ellipse, a closed path where you may see a cyclic repeat of events where not everything has a beginning and an end.\n\n\n\nSo, impressing and/or recording these events on the tape does not happen in a linear way, but through changes of direction, slowdowns and disconnections between the time the event happens in the real and its repetition on the new timeline. It’s still linear of course, but internally configured by successions of recurring sound-germs, arranged on different levels and filtered in a different ways.\n\n\n\nA field based work played on site with a Nagra IV-S and four microphones, using reels instead of tape loops, switching from the ambience couple to the two on the recorder, back and forth, using objects and other shit on the tape, recording everything, doing everything in the field - I mean - outside the studio.\n\n\n\nNo overdubs, no layers, no editing, just a selection of the best parts from each session.'\n\n\n\nGiovanni Lami, 2017\n\n\n\nHysteresis IV was recorded live in Torino, July 5th 2017\n\nThanks to Lorenzo Abattoir. \n\n\n\nvimeo.com/238351530",

But the notion of renewal is built right into their name: the word “coppice” refers to the practice of pruning a tree to promote new growth. The two are in the process of discarding old methods and tools in order to better represent themselves in terms of connections - between sound and visual art, between artist and audience, between the tools themselves.'\n\n\n\n- Bill Meyer,  www.chicagoreader.com\n\n\n\n Physical modeling and modular syntheses by Noé Cuéllar & Joseph Kramer. \n\n\n\nfuturevessel.com/coppice",

      "about": "'We live in a world of musical undo and versioning.' R. Henke\n\n\n\n'Collagen is an ideal release for the format, a mysterious band of sounds that are impossible to identify, close to home yet far away, buried in the past yet re-dredged. To listen to these clicks and cuts, these small drones, these buzzes and plastic ejections is to celebrate the under-appreciated and claim it as one’s own.' Richard Allen, A Closer Listen\n\n\n\n'Collagen manage to maintain intrigue through its masterful compositional tactics. By smoothly transition between songs and portions of songs the album succeeds in creating droning sound conceptions.' Donovan Burton, Positively Underground\n\n\n\n'Extracts of classical music and percussive exercise come warbling atop strands of drone, before decaying suddenly like soft objects dropped into acid. Strange analogue noises burst into view and then disappear, as though retracted in sudden, reflexive pangs of sound-editing regret. Collagen captures the anxious twitches of editing fingers – hands flying across knobs and hurriedly replacing one tape with another – as though Chemiefaserwerk is searching for something within the mess of archival capture.' Jack Chuter, ATTN Magazin",
      "credits": "released April 19, 2016\n            \n            'Marseille-based sound artist Christian Schiefner is enthusiastically exploring the very fabric of sound [...] but unlike many noise-focused endeavours that tend towards a temporal staticity or overload, Chemiefaserwerk creates an eventful performance designed to artfully present a range of unidentifiable sounds whose fluid transformations and abrupt cuts carve the semblance of a narrative.'

      "about": "'Different levels of silence.'\n\n\n\n4 pieces of modern musique concrete composed from sounds made by tape machines recording and/or playing back recorded material, audio errata and/or (un-)finished field-recordings. \n\n\n\nWe can hear the kernel of tape music, the ghost within the machine and all these rare sounds that are normally erased from a finished product. We can then re-phrase the old saying that an empty cassette tape is a tuning orchestra and listen to this record once again.\n\n\n\n'Open face loops, destroyed tape and sources from the field. Non-music, nothingness and collective decay.' TVE\n\n\n\nLibrary Of Congress tape deck\n\nModified Magnavox shoebox tape deck\n\n2 Panasonic RQ-l317 handhelds\n\nTempest reel to reel handheld with footswitch\n\n\n\n'Anormal operates in different levels of silence. Upon beginning each piece, there’s a certain presence that enters the room, yet it still feels as if nothings there. As time passes by a glimpse of fuzz comes into play, then another obscure stroke of the pen, before the listener is thrust back to sterile blankness.. TVE has a clear knack for playing with the listener, a vital skill for any operation in minimalism.'\n\n\n\nDonovan Burtan,  positivelyunderground.wordpress.com/2016/12/01/tve-anormal-et-troublant-album-review/",
