      "about": "On the other side of loneliness, there is solitude—the sound of the self existing as an indistinct web connecting all things. Here, there is stability; there is peace; there is presence. Tapping into this space requires patience and stillness, but once there, a well of inspiration and heartfelt truth inevitably rises from the depths of the soul. Driven by a longing to escape the confines of his home studio, Keith Fullerton Whitman built a makeshift haven of creative respite within the confines of his home attic. What emerged from this introspective sojourn is the captivating album aptly titled \"A Stable Environment.\"\n\n\n\nAt its core, \"A Stable Environment\" is an exploration of deceleration, an embrace of stillness, and a chance to luxuriate in the sacred space where ideas can unfold away from the daily grind. Whitman found solace in a modest setup, fashioning a separate perspective amidst the ethereal attic ambiance. There within the dimly lit walls, he drew forth an array of dusty tonal layers and gently evolving harmonic textures.\n\n\n\nThe sonic landscape of \"A Stable Environment\" arises from the interplay between Whitman’s guitar and an array of real-time sensing and analysis engines, which he used to control a quarter of wavetable synths. Though the guitar's timbre remains absent, its essence permeates the music, infusing it with the familiar touchstone of the artist’s expressive melodies. The inherent idiosyncrasies of the instrument, its organic tuning inconsistencies, weave themselves throughout the fabric of the composition, rendering it a poignant homage to Whitman's deep-rooted connection with the guitar.\n\n\n\nStructured in three distinct phases, \"A Stable Environment\" captures the essence of sound in the air. The entire piece unfolds in real-time, with minimal post-production intervention, rendering Whitman as both performer and listener. Throughout the album’s hour-long runtime, he nimbly coaxes melodies into existence, one note at a time, before stepping back to assess their resonance, gradually augmenting the tonality and form as day dissolves into night.\n\n\n\nThroughout this piece, Whitman’s signature \"Playthroughs\" methodology finds renewed expression. The perpetual feedback system, a hallmark of his artistic approach since the early 2000s, takes on new dimensions with a considerable pause, allowing Whitman to revel in the space between introspection and expansion.\n\n\n\n\"A Stable Environment\" is an invitation to embark on a slow-moving journey, in which the listener might transcend temporal constraints and embrace the interconnectedness of the musical motifs therein. Whitman's keen ear for sonic depth, the spaciousness he masterfully weaves, and the meticulously crafted harmonic layers evoke a sense of serenity and emotion throughout the album. As the newest addition to the label's growing catalog, \"A Stable Environment\" cements Whitman's position as an artist at the pinnacle of his creative prowess, offering a work that is simultaneously singular and seamlessly integrated into the fabric of his oeuvre.",

      "about": "After landing (back) in New York City in 2018 following a series of catastrophic Visa breakdowns in Australia (which forced my family to relocate, quickly, to the other side of the planet for the second time in 5 years) I found myself going to the Brooklyn neighborhood dance clubs more & more often. The Generators & Redactions projects had started to wind down & after a series of great experiences at The Labyrinth and Unsound festivals, I reconnected with so much of the music from my youth & began to forge a pair of performance solutions that reflected my love of both algorithmic & systems-music alongside the timbral palette of “Golden Era” techno/electro.\n\n\n\nThe first element in this suite was a series of “Gridwork” engines created in Max-MSP that allow for real-time transient-analysis & on-the-fly rearrangement of virtually any signals in the audio domain. The year spent playing in a duo formation with Mark Fell had put all kinds of ideas in my head about how to decentralize & structure improvised rhythmic music going forward, and during a 2016 residency at Banff I had put in the ground-work, developing the wireframe of a contemporary engine to achieve this in a manner of weeks. \n\n\n\nIn a parallel development, in mid-2018 I began reconfiguring the same Eurorack Modular system used to record the “Generatorss” material, incorporating a series of basic timbral blocks, each beyond familiar: the zap-squelch of the envelope-filter circuit of the Roland TB-303 (modeled gorgeously in Euro by Eowave), a series of General MIDI PCM datasets (the Roland U-220 palette of my youth via via the Expert Sleepers General CV, along with decent simulacra of the Casio RZ-1 famously heard on Steve Poindexter’s “Computer Madness” & “Work That Mothafucka,” & the Linn Drum), the misunderstood “SuperSaw” wavesets from so many terrible 90s trance failures (recontextualized and patched for polyphony via the Acid Rain Technology Chainsaw), a series of vicious polyphonic “Virtual Analogue” & Wavetable engines (an homage to the Access Virus & Waldorf Micro/Wave topologies, realized mostly with the 4MS Spherical Wavetable Navigator, which👨‍🍳) & even a lightweight vocoder engine (ditto, Andrew’s disting). After a couple of test-runs in Australia, I christened all of this the Acid Causality suite after spending a great evening with Peter Rehberg [R.I.P.] & Russell Haswell in Basel in late September 2019; keeping in mind the multitude of connotations & contexts this phraseology holds.\n\n\n\nAt the awkward transition of hemispheres, I managed to squeeze in a handful of concerts of this music at the most bizarre of places (the famed Greenpoint Metal Bar St. Vitus hosted a particularly odd Monday night culmintaing in Nuclear Death Wish annihilating their borrowed instruments; a lively Market Hotel marathon organized around Bonnie Baxter & Hisham Bharoocha’s Kill Alters made much more sense, as did a Union Pool gig supporting old friend Luke “Helm” Younger; a going-away set opening for Rashad Becker in Northcote & another at the Tote with Primitive Calculators; even a festival appearance inside a dungeon at the top of the Dom Im Berg in Graz sandwiched between François “Kassel Jaeger” Bonnet & Ewa Justka, which was perfect) all of which proved to be fortuitous; the world had other plans come late February 2020 & the whole project ground to a halt without a trace, save for a few stray examples put up on Soundcloud & YouTube™. In a panic I began liquidating most of the Eurorack modular synthesizer hardware used in exchange for utility & grocery money as the pandemic kicked into high gear, long before the Stimulus/CARES schemes went into effect. \n\n\n\nAround mid-March, Sanna Almajedi of e-flux got in touch about assembling a mix for their shuttered bar/restaurant/venue Bar Laika; one of my most frequented spaces, only a few blocks away from home. I leapt at the chance, and put together an hourlong blend (embedded to your right/below) of vocoded & “Resonated” home recordings in this vein from the prior year, which seemed to really get the music out there in a wonderful way. This triggered Calum Gunn of Conditional fame to write in about realizing a pair of cassette releases (a “Hi-Fi” selection of studio-recorded work & a “Lo-Fi” one of live takes recorded, largely with a tiny Sony PCM recorder & iPhone mics in-situ) which he then single-handedly collated, assessed, selected, edited, sequenced, and mastered over a 2-month period (everyone knows this is my Achilles’ heel, whittling down music into a sensible album-length program; Calum gets the collaborator-of-the-decade award, for sure). While our aims were true, in the end I only got as far as designing O-Cards to wrap around custom Black-on-Black Norelco boxes (the latter of which I gleefully custom-ordered from Jerry at AmTech in a quantity ranging in the lower quadruple digits, which then sat in their boxes for 3 years) before a series of personal setbacks & triumphs on both sides put the entire affair on ice. \n\n\n\nIn late 2022, as the last of a trilogy of LP “Reissues” (curated by Goat / YPY’s Hino Koshiro for his Nakid label, P&D’ed by Boomkat) of recent recordings I’d either posted on Bandcamp (R.I.P.) or manufactured as a “Private” Hi-Res AUDIO cassette, the majority of my performance in Eupen was issued as “Meakusma (Generators)” [NKD05]; I was reticent to use the AC designation given that I’d yet to frame it all, but honestly that’s splitting hairs; the long B-Side climax of Spherical Wavetable Navigator wrangling & the acid buildup towards it are certainly in & of this particular lane, if not exactly a stellar example (hey, I’ll own it). \n\n\n\nI’ve resumed (September 2023) assembling the hardware systems following a period of relative inter-personal & life-structural calm, and with the goodwill gained in the summer-long second honeymoon of the Playthroughs ideas in hardware, I’ve started recording again in this more timeless-pulse-oriented vein. The beleaguered (H) & (L) titles have just gone live on all of the streaming apps & platforms at almost exactly the 3-year anniversary of the finalization of the masters, with Calum’s blessing; have at it!",

The year spent playing in a duo formation with Mark Fell had put all kinds of ideas in my head about how to decentralize & structure improvised rhythmic music going forward, and during a 2016 residency at Banff I had put in the ground-work, developing the wireframe of a contemporary engine to achieve this in a manner of weeks. \n\n\n\nIn a parallel development, in mid-2018 I began reconfiguring the same Eurorack Modular system used to record the “Generatorss” material, incorporating a series of basic timbral blocks, each beyond familiar: the zap-squelch of the envelope-filter circuit of the Roland TB-303 (modeled gorgeously in Euro by Eowave), a series of General MIDI PCM datasets (the Roland U-220 palette of my youth via via the Expert Sleepers General CV, along with decent simulacra of the Casio RZ-1 famously heard on Steve Poindexter’s “Computer Madness” & “Work That Mothafucka,” & the Linn Drum), the misunderstood “SuperSaw” wavesets from so many terrible 90s trance failures (recontextualized and patched for polyphony via the Acid Rain Technology Chainsaw), a series of vicious polyphonic “Virtual Analogue” & Wavetable engines (an homage to the Access Virus & Waldorf Micro/Wave topologies, realized mostly with the 4MS Spherical Wavetable Navigator, which👨‍🍳) & even a lightweight vocoder engine (ditto, Andrew’s disting). After a couple of test-runs in Australia, I christened all of this the Acid Causality suite after spending a great evening with Peter Rehberg [R.I.P.] & Russell Haswell in Basel in late September 2019; keeping in mind the multitude of connotations & contexts this phraseology holds.\n\n\n\nAt the awkward transition of hemispheres, I managed to squeeze in a handful of concerts of this music at the most bizarre of places (the famed Greenpoint Metal Bar St. Vitus hosted a particularly odd Monday night culmintaing in Nuclear Death Wish annihilating their borrowed instruments; a lively Market Hotel marathon organized around Bonnie Baxter & Hisham Bharoocha’s Kill Alters made much more sense, as did a Union Pool gig supporting old friend Luke “Helm” Younger; a going-away set opening for Rashad Becker in Northcote & another at the Tote with Primitive Calculators; even a festival appearance inside a dungeon at the top of the Dom Im Berg in Graz sandwiched between François “Kassel Jaeger” Bonnet & Ewa Justka, which was perfect) all of which proved to be fortuitous; the world had other plans come late February 2020 & the whole project ground to a halt without a trace, save for a few stray examples put up on Soundcloud & YouTube™. In a panic I began liquidating most of the Eurorack modular synthesizer hardware used in exchange for utility & grocery money as the pandemic kicked into high gear, long before the Stimulus/CARES schemes went into effect. \n\n\n\nAround mid-March, Sanna Almajedi of e-flux got in touch about assembling a mix for their shuttered bar/restaurant/venue Bar Laika; one of my most frequented spaces, only a few blocks away from home. I leapt at the chance, and put together an hourlong blend (embedded to your right/below) of vocoded & “Resonated” home recordings in this vein from the prior year, which seemed to really get the music out there in a wonderful way. This triggered Calum Gunn of Conditional fame to write in about realizing a pair of cassette releases (a “Hi-Fi” selection of studio-recorded work & a “Lo-Fi” one of live takes recorded, largely with a tiny Sony PCM recorder & iPhone mics in-situ) which he then single-handedly collated, assessed, selected, edited, sequenced, and mastered over a 2-month period (everyone knows this is my Achilles’ heel, whittling down music into a sensible album-length program; Calum gets the collaborator-of-the-decade award, for sure). While our aims were true, in the end I only got as far as designing O-Cards to wrap around custom Black-on-Black Norelco boxes (the latter of which I gleefully custom-ordered from Jerry at AmTech in a quantity ranging in the lower quadruple digits, which then sat in their boxes for 3 years) before a series of personal setbacks & triumphs on both sides put the entire affair on ice. \n\n\n\nIn late 2022, as the last of a trilogy of LP “Reissues” (curated by Goat / YPY’s Hino Koshiro for his Nakid label, P&D’ed by Boomkat) of recent recordings I’d either posted on Bandcamp (R.I.P.) or manufactured as a “Private” Hi-Res AUDIO cassette, the majority of my performance in Eupen was issued as “Meakusma (Generators)” [NKD05]; I was reticent to use the AC designation given that I’d yet to frame it all, but honestly that’s splitting hairs; the long B-Side climax of Spherical Wavetable Navigator wrangling & the acid buildup towards it are certainly in & of this particular lane, if not exactly a stellar example (hey, I’ll own it). \n\n\n\nI’ve resumed (September 2023) assembling the hardware systems following a period of relative inter-personal & life-structural calm, and with the goodwill gained in the summer-long second honeymoon of the Playthroughs ideas in hardware, I’ve started recording again in this more timeless-pulse-oriented vein. The beleaguered (H) & (L) titles have just gone live on all of the streaming apps & platforms at almost exactly the 3-year anniversary of the finalization of the masters, with Calum’s blessing; have at it!",

      "about": "At this very moment (January, 2020) I’m procrastinating; stalled, run out of gas while hovering over an article on “resonance” for one of the GRM’s journals, on the very nature of funneling energy into an acute location, in this case a lone strata of frequency, in air, in sound.The approach I had intended to take (which has proven fruitless, time and time again) was to dust up a short first-person exposé on the perceived “magic” of the phenomena, although as any scientist will tell you there’s nothing magical about it; everything is entirely quantifiable. The idea of romanticizing a perceived “other” in these times of scientific/common-sense erasure has me a bit uneasy, but I have made my bed and now I am laying in it, fully demotivated, and looking elsewhere; anywhere else. \n\n\n\nIt was in this state that I sat down and began experimenting with the working methods you’re hearing now; at first, it was a matter of picking recordings that already had some heightened sense of resonance (the high-feedback delay-synth motif that is the sonic signature of Broadcast’s “Echo’s Answer” is a fantastic example) either as a production tenet or accident and, barring the presence of that, an insistence on a ghosted secondary/tertiary tonality that could be surreptitiously eked out of the existing frequency-map to yield an entirely alternate view of the song in question. With a few of them I stayed in my lane, but perhaps offset or elongated the tonality it along the song’s time-axis grain. Again, experiments; each one taking a different approach.\n\n\n\nA few significant things started happening; for one I was only motivated to work with music that I truly, deeply love - and this is where this whole endeavor set itself apart from the “Greatest Hits” or “Reproductions” programs (each chock full of hate-renders) and, for some unexplained reason, I only seem to have only chosen UK-centric songs, which happened entirely by accident until I noticed the pattern & continued in this fashion. The cycling patterns that dictated each tonal focus were dialed in prior to scrutinizing the form & function of a given entry, then shifted to be in time & key. This I feel is crucial; it’s one thing to transcribe something then send it through the wringer, another entirely to let the salient-memory aspects play out. The outcomes when I guessed the chord progressions wrongly, from memory, are easily the best ones. \n\n\n\nStylistically, I had two reference points (both, confusingly, from 1998, when I apparently stopped being influenced) in mind when I was working on these transformations; Josh “Kit” Clayton’s superb “The Mimic And The Model” (algorithmic, software-based delineations of strict adherences to-, or graded denials of-, the master clock; not all that far off sonically) & Torsten “Various Artists” Pröfrock’s “8, 8.5, 9” (which has a remarkably effective “set and forget” ethos, esp. in the tuning & delay-time settings which seem to “magically” fall into complex polyrhythms). Again, these are purely for reference; I love these two pieces of music, esp. how there are moments where the energies of each instrument appear to surge, recede, ebb, flow, all due to arbitrary, fragmentary collisions of production elements that, for a split second, take up the same frequency ranges. This is what we hear in Minimalism that makes it so significant, and the ability to “choir” like this in the digital domain is part of the appeal of working quickly, and repeatably in such a manner.\n\n\n\nThis is a continuation of the exact sort of “Meta-” music projects I’ve been carrying out since the dawn of the Millennium (witness the over 200 “Greatest Hits” made around then) & the intended listening environment for all of this is definitely on a proper, full-range club-PA system or, barring that, a really, really good pair of headphones (the sub-octaves on the lower-range pitch-analyses go down to about 12hz!)\n\n\n\nKeith Fullerton Whitman, Fort Greene, January 2020",

Despite playing a handful of gigs a few years later as a trio w/ Tomas Korber, these remain the only recordings of our collaboration.",

      "about": "Two-part, real-time Musique Concrète suite composed & performed in Quad at Constellation, Chicago, Leap-Year Day 2020, specifically and solely for Peter Margasak’s Frequency Festival. \n\n\n\nA standalone component of the “Redactions” series convened for the Constellation performance, the source material for this 4-channel improvisation consists largely of YouTube™ rips of Drum Solos (by, respectively: Ben Riley, Han Bennink, Sunny Murray, Toshi Tsuchitori, Tony Williams, Billy Higgins, Billy Cobham, & Jon Christensen [RIP]) alongside ASMR-lineage sonic interaction-artifacts of tiny, tiny magnets and a small selection of Redaction “Greatest Hits” materials (Serge recorded at GRM & EMS, Synthi 100 at Rick’s, Tarek Atoui’s Organ Within at Kurimanzutto, Joep Van Lieshout sculptures at Pioneer Works, speaker stands at Standards, and distant, audience-perspective field recordings of Amadou Suso & Het Interstedelijk Harmoniumverbond) used solely as Carrier-Wave sources for the vocoding of the above Modulator-Wave feeds. \n\n\n\nMixed and Mastered at Lafayette Underground on March 3rd, 2020. Stereo ½ channel direct feed coupled with ¾ channel feed from room-mics supplied as a negation/inversion against the direct feed, with everything sent through a maze of software comparators/gates for further processing. Headphones and/or a wide-stereo array are essential for reproducing the azimuthal aspects of the multi-channel image. Please listen as loud as humanly possible, within reason.\n\n\n\n*** (4/4/20) added several bonus materials including a sextet of (home) studio rehearsals of the Drum Solo & Grain/Stretch sections, along with an additional 60-minute unedited run-through of the piece ***",

Several have asked for pointers to specific pieces within this (understandably) insurmountable collection for focused listening. While the Alice set overall is my favorite of the three sound/form-wise, there's a great 10-minute segment in the middle of the second half of the Meakusma set that is as close to what I had in mind while researching/developing these systems as I've been able to perform in front of an audience: I've made that particular track FREE, so please go ahead and add it to your collection!

      "about": "\"Amposta Generators b/w Lleida Generators\" offers the highlights of two extended, durational performances reviving the \"Generators\" framework (just shy of its 8th anniversary) executed during Spring of last year in the titular Catalonian cities; the former just after noon on the 21st of May inside Amposta's \"Lo Pati Center d'Art Terres De l'Ebre\" & the latter the day before as the sun went down outside of Lleida's \"Centre d'Art la Panera\". \n\n\n\nBoth begin with the familiar cascading Sample & Hold canons before a set of rapidly complicating, albeit cleanly sub-dividable rhythm-arcs & transpositions creep in; while the former set is augmented only by subtle audience interference & brief interjections of pre-recorded Concrète sound, the Lleida set goes one further by incorporating subtle real-time augmentations of the environment itself along with an almost linear, dance-floor ready coda incorporating primitive analogue drum synthesis.",

      "credits": "released May 29, 2017\n            \n            Since moving to Australia in late 2015, every year, on my birthday, I tend to realize an edition of some sort on Broken-Music's in-house label Industrial Abbotsford; last year was the run of 25 hand-cut copies of the \"Halle (Salle)\" LP, and this it's a six-disc set of \"Automatic\" synthesizer works entitled \"Late Monoliths, 2011-2013.\"\n\n\n\nThe pieces on this set all use the same methodology; a particular combination of elements specific to the Hybrid Digital-Analogue setup I've been slowly refining over the past 15 years was dialed in, set in play, then captured over the course of roughly an hour, with little to no intervention. All of the sounds originate from within the system itself, and were subjected only to subtle augmentation in the mixing & mastering stages.\n\n\n\nOf the scores of recordings made during this stretch, these six were chosen as they show a clear progression from rather ecclesiastic, melodic forms - the first three discs - into more challenging material. As a general guide, I recommend listening to one disc, once a week, during an hour that you put aside for listening. In the traditional of Indian Carnatic music, the first three discs are more \"morning\" appropriate, and can be heard at a moderate level - the last three are more \"evening\" and are best given a little more volume. In no way is there an emphasis on chronology, other than that the pieces are presented in the order they were recorded; feel free to mix & match, and in fact disregard pieces that you favor less.\n\n\n\nIf you see a pattern emerging here it's because you're familiar with Douglas Leedy's seminal \"Entropical Paradise\" set, on which this enterprise is loosely based; I have been scheming for decades to riff on this exact modus, this is the eventual result. I'm normally not one for dedications, but I feel compelled to invoke the memory of Richard Lainhart, who ushered words of kindness and encouragement on several occasions when I was absolutely ready to throw in the towel right around the time these were being laid to tape; that and the fact that his 1974 piece \"White Night\" was- and is a clear influence on how these pieces took shape. RIP Richard.",

(2019) is an 8-channel installation work comprised of recordings made over a 15-year period on differing Serge Modular systems recorded at the Banff Centre for Arts & Creativity, the Columbia Computer Music Center, Elektron Musik Studion, the Groupe de Recherches Musicales, Harvard University Studio for Electro-Acoustic Composition, and Melbourne Electronic Sound Studio convolved with fragments of speech, recitation, and extra-textual verbal communication. \n\n\n\nPartly an homage to formative speech-transformation works such as Herbert Eimert’s “Epitaph für Aikichi Kuboyama (1960-1962)”, the mapping of the frequency spectra of time-aligned formants to a catalog of full-range synthesizer signals yields a warm, attenuated field of sustained sound that ebbs through each space at a modest volume, inviting the listener to dwell on individual timbres, phrases, and conversations while assessing the overall sound-field. \n\n\n\nUtilizing a sliding, modular structure to diffuse linked stereo pairs of convolutions into 4 discrete chambers, the individual parts become groups of voices heard distinctly, overheard from the next room, or made subliminally aware of via bleed-through from each adjoining space.\"\n\n\n\nThis stereo reduction is one of an endless number of possible outcomes & was composed & finalized at the GRM, February 2019. In addition to the 24/96 masters of the GRM session (broken into 6 evenly-spaced access points, mainly to be compatible with Bandcamp) is an unbroken, 4-hour 16/44 stereo room recording of the debut staging of the piece at Remote Viewing, Philadelphia, PA on April 28th, 2019.\n\n\n\nThanks to Ean White, Patti Schmidt, François Bonnet, John Chantler, Robin Fox, Byron Scullin, Seth Cluett, Geoff Mullen, Eric Laska, and Serge Tcherepnin.",

      "about": "Intended as a double-cassette release, this suite of music; conceived, actualized, spatialized, & recorded in Quad over a Funktion-One array in a room in Athens' Exarchia district over a 3-day period, is an attempt to blur the hard, systemic lines between focused & unfocused listening. \n\n\n\nPresenting two programs; one realized purely for the sake of the \"public\" in-situ spectacle, the other an entirely revisionist affair based on the \"private\" experience of having played & recorded a separate, unheard set of music for an empty room later to be assessed & finalized, the master narrative arc folds from solace to chaos, fully embracing the bipolar nature of musical & artistic practice as a means of expression.\n\n\n\nAll of the music heard here shares the same genetic makeup: \"Generative\" 4-voice ASR oscillator canons & \"Redacted\" source materials gathered in & around the environment in question, including contributions by Chris Chondropoulos & elements gathered during one of Christina Kubisch's Electrical Walks, utilizing her proprietary receiver headphones. \n\n\n\nPrior to the audience's gathering for the \"public\" event, the same configuration was performed to an empty room for approximately one hour; the first segment of the second tape captures the moments right before & after the doors to the venue were unlocked, the final segment the transition back to \"private\".\n\n\n\nRecorded at Romantso, Athens, Greece, May 23rd, 24th, and 25th, 2017 as part of documenta 14. Mixed and Mastered at GRM, Paris, France on November 14th, 2017. Thanks to Paolo Thorsten-Nagel, Dmitri Papadatos, Bill Kouligas, Christos Chondropoulos, Stratos Bichakis, Constant Dice, Nektarios Papadimitriou, Yorgos Yeorgiou, Christina Kubisch, Alan Bishop, & François Bonnet.",

      "about": "On the occasion of the 10-year anniversary of the discovery of the \"Generators\" patch/performance/recording-solution, here is a collection showing the piece in its ultimate form; four extended plays captured in-situ across the first few months of 2019, covering studio, rehearsal, live, and installation implementations, with all takes focusing on gradual, almost imperceptible timbral & formal change.\n\n\n\nThe emphasis on the constantly re-framing rhythmic center is perhaps the most recent addition to the piece/setup, incorporating several layers of drum synthesis voices & even some classic 90s General MIDI PCM layers to the mix. but these are, as always, meant for unbroken, fully-sensory, semi-focused listening (headphones, maximum volume) and are intended as tools to aid in the ascension to alpha-states.\n\n\n\nAll pieces are released in here in their native 24-bit, 96khz resolutions; mixed & mastered during March of 2019 at Lafayette Underground. Special thanks to Sanna Almajedi, François Bonnet, Philippe Dao, Rodolfo de Brito, Pedro Gomes, Gideon Kiers, Emmanuel Richier, Lucas van der Velden, Pierce Warnecke, Anne van Waveren, and Annette Wolfsberger.",

      "about": "DEMEGO 026\n\n\n\n… Occlusion is a loose framework for a multi-channel, freely improvised piece of LIVE ELECTRONIC MUSIC, performed without the aid or consent of pre-recorded or even pre-arranged materials of any kind. A given realization will last between 10 and 30 minutes ; time is elastic. Every effort has been made to avoid divisible rhythms (although mistakes are occasionally made) ... Still, I consider it a \"kind\" of Dance Music.\n\n\n\nThese two realizations, recorded a week apart at festivals in France and The Netherlands during February 2012, capture the piece (much like those on the Generators LP) in two entirely different iterations, in states of (A) a mildly inebriated bliss & (B) an arbitrarily triggered blind rage. Both recordings were made at 24-bit, 96khz through the absolute cheapest means available to the consumer to do so. They sound fantastic.\n\n\n\nOcclusions is a companion piece to Generators in that they share the same tool-set ... however, it is the FREE JAZZ yang to Generator's MINIMALIST yin. It is not recommended to those seeking meter, melody, cleanliness, or a clearly outlined organizational sense.",

The premiere was made as part of Insonic festival on the 24th of November & the piece was entered into the regular circulation of the sculpture, enjoying nightly performances from the 26th on.\n\n\n\nCreated specifically for the Morning Line, 'Epithets\" is based around a generative, self-automating Hybrid Analogue-Digital Modular Synthesizer patch that applies principles of Werner Heisenberg's research on \"Turbulent Flows\" into a series of sub-dividable motor-rhythm arcs that freely wander across the internal sound-fields of the sculpture. \n\n\n\nWhile structurally similar to early Minimalism, the piece incorporates gradual, almost subliminal shifts between modal & nonlinear tonalities that only become apparent over the piece's complete duration.",

As these concerts show the piece in it’s infancy, it feels nice to have them all available in one place ... for me it’s a keepsake of this very busy month. \n\n\n\nThe label gave the go-ahead to architect this all-clear edition, with professionally duplicated / imprinted tapes housed inside the elusive “side by side” double norelco (went to hell & back trying to track these down ; wasn’t easy !!!) with two separate laser-transparency inserts (one 5” x 14” “cover”, then a 3.5” x 14” “insert”) ... and while the fidelity ranges from the crystal-clear board-capture (c/o the norman conquest) of the “on land” set to the room-sound video-mic gristle of the “i hear a new world” piece (c/o feeding tube’s ted lee) the tape-duping levels the playing field & all come across as a coherent whole.\n\n\n\nSuper happy with how this turned out; hope you enjoy!\n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\n\naoc7028: keith fullerton whitman \"live generators (1.5)\" c40.\n\n\n\nthis tape needs no introduction. kfw has been killing it. two 20 minute live pieces showcasing keith's mastery at transformation of environment in real time! just mind blowing stuff here. great moment on the b side with an angry spectator yelling at keith.\n\n\n\nall tapes are pro duplicated with imprinting & locally, professionally printed covers in full color.\n\n\n\nlimited edition of 100 copies. october 2010 release ; an extension of the “generator” series, documenting the final two “first generation” iterations of the piece, as recorded in the whitehaus basement (side a) and the starlab (side b) ...\n\n\n\nthe squawking rhythmic elements herein were supplanted by the use of actual drum sounds (well ; purpose-built “drum synths”) in further performances of the piece ; as such these are the two “gateway” versions ...",

These un-monitored and unedited pieces were recorded on June 9th and 10th, 2012. According to Whitman, the tracks ‘all hinge around the same set of generative patches, where white noise is sampled then used to derive a series of 12 bucket brigade voltages that are attenuated, then multiplied and applied to all manner of automations within the patches’. Whitman goes on to explain that ‘all changes are programmed into the patches, even formal changes are due to extremely long duty cycles’.",

      "about": "Digital issue of this 2011 cassette-only suite of \"Automatic\" Electronic Music. I had given Ekhein's Matt Sullivan instructions to either randomly use the 5 different pairs of master tapes across the manufactured edition -or to choose his favorite & stick to that. I'm still not sure what he chose, but I'm offering all five here as an incentive, along with a completely different early version of these two pieces.",
      "credits": "released April 20, 2011\n            \n            Something of a “follow-up” to the No-label individually-cut 7” from last year, these two pieces were recorded right here in the Mimaroglu offices (before i moved my “Analogue Workstation” back into the home studio earlier this year) using a more variable-intensive version of the “Generator” patch & a CV-controlled outboard spring reverb unit to yield a “slo-mo” version of Satie & Debussy-inspired “Salon Music”.\n\n\n\nArguably the most “Romantic” music i’ve done in a while, made more so by the transfer to magnetic tape (it really does lend to a certain “Underwater” ... or “Sunken” fidelity that wouldn’t have been possible with any other consumer format). I’m quite happy with how this turned out & it works well as a “Sunday Morning” aside to the more lightning-fast analogue/ digital electronic music i’ve been doing this year.\n\n\n\nEK50-KFW \"Regaining Composure / Negating Freedom\" c30\n\n\n\n\"Beautiful automatic melodies from Keith Fullerton Whitman. expanding on work from the extremely limited \"Losing Everything / Four Oscillators Reverb Nice\" 7 inch lathe he self released in 2009. Whitman is blurring alot of the lines between machine and music on this release.\"\n\n\n\nRecorded at Mimaroglu, June 16th 2009. \n\nComposed at Mimaroglu, February 21-24, 2011.",

      "about": "The result of a commission to compose music & sound design for the final level of an interactive digital environment (read: video game) project; essentially a request to reconstruct the \"(Recorded in) Lisbon\" set in the style of Brian Eno's \"An Ending (Ascent)\" (how close to this goal the resultant music ended up being is up for debate). This extended late- \"Playthroughs\" piece, with its propulsive pulsing square-wave figure & floating layers of sine-wave \"Shuffler\" guitar & granularly frozen direct guitar playing, was a late peak in the piece's lifespan & was likely the closest the piece ever flew to the sun (in purely commercial terms). \n\n\n\nIncluded here are a stereo mix-down of the music used on the seventh level, an earlier rough mix, then a montage of all of the SFX, stabs, and cues generated in the process. I'm also including (in the digital package) the three individual stereo layers of the L7 soundtrack as bonus material; these were theoretically to be embedded as standalone playing elements that would loop in & out of time with each other ala \"Dream House Variations\", but this option was never implemented. \n\n\n\nFeel free to construct an endless, shifting variant by looping each element in the playback engine of your choice; just pad a few seconds to a minute of silence on either side of the three parts, then season to taste.",

      "about": "Digital release of the \"Dream House Variations\" material, recorded during the Summer & Fall of 2008 & released as a quadruple tape-box via Mike Pollard's Arbor during Spring 2009 intended for \n\n\n\nIncluded here are the complete 52-part \"Studio\" session used to populate the four cassettes, a complete run-through of both sides of each cassette transcribed from a production copy on a Tascam 202 MkV, then finally both a four-plus-hour mesh of said cassette transcriptions into a single stereo field & a two-hour high resolution stereo microphone recording of all four tapes playing simultaneously in a specific room: the Mimaroglu offices in Cambridge, MA in which the pieces was Conceived, Composed, and Executed.\n\n\n\nFeel free to listen to this in one, or all of three ways: head straight for the last two tracks to hear the \"Final\" version with all four elements firing simultaneously either with or without the intended glorious room-tone, set up an 8-channel scenario by looping each of the tape transcriptions out of the four separate stereo audio playback engines of your choosing, or simply listen to the session material; your call, and none a wrong choice.",
      "credits": "released April 20, 2009\n            \n            arbor89 Keith Fullerton Whitman - \"Dream House Variations\" c44+c40+c36+c32\n\n\n\nKeith Fullerton Whitman’s first release in over two years manifests itself in an inspired take on aural perception. “Dream House Variations” is a meditative experience, comprised of four cassettes intended for simultaneous listening. The variations themselves are reworkings of two endless loop cassettes through Doepfer analog modular systems; KFW exacts his technical mastery through dense filtering, panning, and modulation of the source.\n\n\n\nThe Octophonic nature of the set creates an infinite amount of listening experiences, not only due to the syncing of the tapes, but also placement within a room and the equipment used for playback. The music becomes a part of the room much like the quadraphonic intentions outlined in Eno’s “Ambient” series. Each experience creates new instances of counterpoint, melding tonality, and individual senses of perception eliciting the source of the variation: mind or machine?\n\n\n\nIn an edition of 150 four tape sets in oversized vinyl cases with full color cardstock covers, silver cardstock inserts, and printed labels. \n\n\n\n...\n\n\n\n\"Here’s something i’d been meaning to do for years, and thanks to the constant (friendly) prodding of Arbor’s Mike Pollard it’s now a tangible reality. Starting with a single 60-second loop-cassette of a field-recording made during the Saturday afternoon of the 2008 No Fun Fest, I started running the signal through the Doepfer, recording exactly 225 minutes of Improvisations & “Variations” - utilizing the pitch-control of two Sony Walkmen & the filters & processing agents in the synth itself. \n\n\n\nThese were recorded with mic’s on the woofers of two studio monitors, so that the sounds in the room whilst i was recording (patching, the occasional cough / murmer, and at one point, a bag full of ping pong balls) could be heard. How you’re meant to listen to this ::\n\n\n\n4 x auto-reverse cassette decks, each plugged into a different amplifier / stereo speaker-set (or 4 x boom-boxes with detachable speakers) in the far corner(s) of a room (wood floor, no carpeting) - speakers for each corner / unit should be placed as far apart as possible to accentuate the inter-channel movement of each taped component.\n\n\n\nStart all decks simultaneously; there will be short pauses at the end of each tape-side as the decks flip, then 1-minute silence(s) at the end(s) of the second side(s) of each tape. As the tapes begin to loop, they synchronize in different ways, causing an endless array of variations. \n\n\n\nUse of different brands / models of tape-deck / boom-box recommended. Play loud, quietly, or anywhere in between. Adjust individual components to taste; use of fast-forward, reverse, & tape-speed manipulation encouraged.\n\n\n\nThe set itself turned out very nicely, with Mike’s designs coating the outside of an “Audiobook” style plastic folio, with the four cassettes mounted inside along with a metallic insert w/ the text above.\"",

      "about": "Digital release of the second album by the duo of Geoff Mullen & Keith Fullerton Whitman, recorded over the course of a single day in 2009, then issued in February 2010 via Dan \"Chuck Person\" Lopatin's Upstairs CDR; everything presented here in its original, glorious 24/96 master-tape iteration. \n\n\n\nAlso included are the two side-length tracks from the Summer 2010 \"Take Me To Your Dealer\" cassette on Jeff \"Rene Hell\" Witscher's Agents of Chaos (originally credited to Any Given Sunday), also recorded that day, as well as a couple of unreleased pieces from the same session.",
      "credits": "released February 1, 2010\n            \n            Geoff Mullen and Keith Fullerton Whitman welcome you to the new-domestic. the moving hallway is dotted with tif frames and leads you to a center room location radiating with CMYK hum. This sonic-grand-tour was recorded live to glass, over one day in Providence, Rhode Island; a machine groove epic in movements that offers up total sonoronarrative immersion while kindling thoughts of Paul Verhoven-like industrial safehouses in which doomed plans are made.\n\n\n\nComing from inside the walls of this micro-future, GM/KFW surge a permeating drive that shows lost footage and reveals forgotten locations, levels below. the CS-50/MT-68 combo-splices finally unveil the screen -- tomorrow into gateway. The chimes from within lead you deeper and the screen behind you shuts off. The finale take on almost a dare I say Haruomi vibe; West meets East without overt crystallization of dialectic black helicopters and blurred out kanji. Nice and wide and deep stereo balance to boot. Seminal synth war/drama action from east coast legends that commit to the landing and stick it.",

      "about": "First digital release for this suite of late “Playthroughs” for guitar, synthesizer, & computer, issued in part on a small-run cassette release by Brad Rose via Digitalis Limited in May of 2009. \n\n\n\nThe “Side 1” half is the tail-end of said improv, run through a low-pass filter taking its cut-off frequency from the relative “Loudness” of the audio (i.e. the louder it gets, the more high-end it lets through) - a nice & simple piece that turned out well (there’s even a bit of “dry” guitar playing at the end there). The “Side A” half covers the beginning of the improv, with the computer essentially “Playing” the Doepfer, recording the output, then re-introducing filtered variants of the recording back into the mix minutes later. This builds into a frenzy of over-laid pointillist synth blips that coalesce into the drone that makes up the “Side 1” half, loop and repeat. This digital edition includes the two edited & \"Composed\" 32-minute halves, exactly as they were sent to NAC for duplication.\n\n\n\nThe remaining material consists of similar attempts recorded during the same two-week stretch while putting the tape together; varying combinations of Guitar & Modular Synthesizer played in a loose, improvisatory style into a Max-MSP patch, then recorded \"Live\" to glass, including a concert at Night Light in Carrboro, North Carolina on the evening of the 12th of April (Track 11). Track 9 is the actual raw take of the material edited down for the \"Taking Away\" cassette; the rest I'm including for those curious about the Composing, Recording & Editing processes for this sort of project, and how many seemingly dead ends at the time can sound like fully fleshed out ideas years, in fact close to a decade later.\n\n\n\nThis essentially covers the very tail-end of the \"Playthroughs\" era, coming in 3 years after \"Recorded in Lisbon\", and just before I began focusing solely on the Modular Synthesizer as the main component.",
      "credits": "released May 29, 2009\n            \n            This doozy has been a fleeting idea in the cosmos for a while now, but finally has poked its head through the electric ether and made an appearance. \"Taking Away\" is massive. Two side-long 32 minute pieces for Modular Synthesizer that harken back to '70s minimalism and muted exorcism. Each ride is like a golden river of dreams pouring through electronic excess. Pointillist forays fall in-line perfectly with the hypnotic whirrs of subtle, synthetic manipulation.\n\n\n\nIn all, Whitman is at his best here. he finds the cracks between the crevices, lighting a new path along the way. Edition of 200, pro-dubbed on high-bias cassettes.",

I've fleshed out the digital package with the individual pieces in order, including the otherwise unreleased \"Generator 4\" & the complete \"Generator 7\" & \"Generator 8\".",

      "about": "Nasturtium was my \"Private Metal\" concept ca. 2003-2004, fake backstory & everything (below), right when we were all (re) investigating this stuff. No apologies, but certainly no critical reassessment necessary - it is exactly what it is - so if the idea of hearing Steve Reich's \"Piano Phase\" played by a Doom Metal band is at all appealing, then you've got it right there in track #3. The first two involve more of an ensemble sound - I was going for Träd, Gräs & Stenar / International / Harvester covering \"Earth 2\" - the last two were recorded earlier for various projects, notably the commemorative wedding album of Aquarius / A Minor Forest's Andee Connors. You can hear the familiar \"Feedback Resonating A Snare Drum\" technique as utilized on \"Playthroughs\" right there at the opening bell.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, this intended LP & 7\" set made it all the way to the manufacturing stage, where it was plagued by a series of mishaps, ultimately thwarting the whole affair. I still have several test pressings of the LP w/ various issues (quiet or noisy mastering, missing tracks) but the 7\" made it through & was \"released\" separately via Mimaroglu around June 2010 after I got tired of moving the box around the office. Feel free to grab a copy here & you'll still get the digital release of the whole album.\n\n\n\nThose of you that are surprised at this music & the whole gesture: keep in mind that I co-wrote a column in Guitar World magazine for a couple of years in the early 90s that covered mostly Metal & related genres; I was knee deep in all of this for ages & ages.",
      "credits": "released June 21, 2004\n            \n            Like many of you, I became fascinated with Black Metal after hearing the story (told, in hyperbole-padded hushed tones, often while consuming beer with other men) of Dead, Euronymous, and Count Grishnackh et.al back in the late 90s. Followed the stuff rabidly, attended what gigs I could, but the local (Boston-area) presence of this stuff, let alone a tangibly-accessible (talking about something as physical as Black Metal with others on the internet is like knitting about an earthquake) community of fans, was entirely unheard of.\n\n\n\nThen ... one warm Somerville night back in 2004, I heard what sounded like cats asphyxiating other cats coming out of the basement of a house a few miles away from the Reckankomplex. I stood in the street with PETA on speed dial & listened for a bit, mustered up the courage to ring the doorbell. Approximately 12 minutes later I was met with a “the fuck YOU want” from the individual now known as The Seeer (other members include The Summoner, The Banished, and The Returned) who, upon the offer to release a recording of said asphyxiations into the wild, invited me into their lair (curiously titled \"The Haag Den\") & rewarded me with a chalice of ... Heineken ... and a demo of the band (then named “Halter”). Other than The Seeer’s brief appearance at a Reckankomplex box social later the same year (during which I lent him copies of Steve Reich’s “Early Works”, Åkos Rozmann’s “Images and the Dream of Death” and Eliane Radigue’s “Adnos I - III” - all of which are still missing from my collection - I heard head nor hide from any of the Halter members in the interim.\n\n\n\nFlash forward about ... 6 years; had completely forgotten about the meeting, the demo, and the agreement; such is life (especially my life). But then I found it in a spring-cleaning raid, spun it, & was completely floored. Walked over to the Halter house the same night, and, sure enough, all four residents still very much living there, very much living the Black Metal nightmare. although their alliance was now renamed the albeit far-more apropos Nasturtium. Reneged the deal & can now now offer you this fine collection.\n\n\n\nFeatured here are the original 2-track demo from 2004, including a piece featuring the triple-guitar/bass lineup recorded by close-mic’ing snare drums placed directly in front of their amps, plus a decidedly more “psych” oriented number, then a side-length piece from the following year, which, I have to say, sounds a hell of a lot like a “cover” of Reich’s “Piano Phase”, and with initial copies only, a bonus 7” of “Contemporary Material” - shudder at the thought, but in fact this includes a nicely synth-heavy, double-free-drum blaster and a fine moog-drone to cleanse the palate.\n\n\n\nIssued in a “Boutique” edition- what can I say? I have something of a guilty conscience for sitting on this for so long; decided to make it “Nice”, with both a Black-on-Black LP in one of those nice euro “Polybag” Black/Black windowed inner sleeves and a Black-on-Black 7”(in a black paper envelope all housed in “Library Style” Laserdisc sleeve with a little pouch for the index card; in this case an unintelligible “Credits” sheet along with two ... you guessed it ... Black inserts.\n\n\n\nOne-strike edition of 300, available exclusively from Mimaroglu Music Sales and its acolytes ... Behold.",

      "about": "\"In the spring of 1997 I began to work at Forced Exposure. Inspired by the great number of DIY artists and labels that FE distributed, I decided to form a label called Reckankreuzungsklankewerkzeuge, compiled all of the concise breakbeat-themed sketches and short attention-span experiments that had been languishing on DAT, and, in April of 1998, released an LP called \"Attention: Cats.\" \n\n\n\nThe success of the LP, and the subsequent interest in my break-cutup experiments led me to compile my 11 favorite full-length tracks into a CD, \"Oiseaux 96-98\", which was released in August of 1999 to great reviews and much interest from those tired of the \"by the numbers\" approach to electronic dance music. \n\n\n\nThe adage, \"You have your whole life to make your first album, and a year to make the second\" felt particularly apt, and it wasn't until 2002 that another full-length album of music by Hrvatski was released, this time on Mike Paradinas' Planet µ label. \n\n\n\nBy this time I had already begun focusing my efforts on recording and performing more abstract, less rhythm-based music, and had begun releasing records under my own name of digital minimalism and improvised guitar-computer pieces. I occasionally revisit the moniker for remix requests and the occasional single or compilation track.\"\n\n\n\n - Keith Fullerton Whitman, March 7th, 2005.",

      "about": "Greatest Hits (2003-)\n\n\n\nOn the eve of my 30th birthday, for no particular reason whatsoever (perhaps to combat the onset of the various mid-life crises ; insomnia, ennui, etc.) I began rendering \"automatic\" \"enhancements\" of the most salient aspects of the pop music of my youth; a line, bar, or fragment of a particular song (after being heard out in \"the wild\" in the present & re-triggering its memory; akin to running into an old friend on the street & having to stage that awkward, stilted conversation neither of you wants to have) was chosen based on how much my nostalgic recollection of it differed from its contemporary reality.\n\n\n\nEach edit was looped at exactly half-speed, then run through a battery of time- & gain-based processes in series that slowly and meticulously chewed through the audio, revealing hidden layers of content, context, and temporal / spectral production details ... like shining a flashlight into the dark corners of each selection, exposing the hidden ghosts lurking within. Each representation here consists of a selected 3-20 minute chunk based on the perceived \"significance\" unraveled via this process, lasting a natural-seeming length (i.e. the ones that are less … \"rewarding\" tend to be shorter, the better ones longer) …\n\n\n\nI know this is a cliché, but PLEASE PLAY THESE EXTREMELY LOUDLY, over BIG SPEAKERS (subs are a MUST given the low-end emphasis; don't bother listening over your laptop or computer speakers !!! you'll miss more than half of what's going on here) ... I've uploaded an accompanying image for each \"Hit\" (all of these are derived from the artwork of a given artists' \"Greatest Hits\" album - mass, minor, or tertiary market editions [personally I love seeing & using the various \"Горбушка\" -lineage variations] - or, failing that, the cover of the single or album via which the track in question arrived) made utilizing tactically similar means (cheap, often preset plugin \"enhancement\" algorithms, rendered in multiple passes).\n\n\n\nThe entire suite is dedicated to Tim Haslett, without whose guidance (through the then seemingly-endless sea of post-'00 Houston chopped & screwed mixes) I would have undoubtedly missed out on the chance to dwell on the pivotal ideas at play herein.",

      "about": "\"In the spring of 1997 I began to work at Forced Exposure. Inspired by the great number of DIY artists and labels that FE distributed, I decided to form a label called Reckankreuzungsklankewerkzeuge, compiled all of the concise breakbeat-themed sketches and short attention-span experiments that had been languishing on DAT, and, in April of 1998, released an LP called \"Attention: Cats.\"\n\n\n\nThe success of the LP, and the subsequent interest in my break-cutup experiments led me to compile my 11 favorite full-length tracks into a CD, \"Oiseaux 96-98\", which was released in August of 1999 to great reviews and much interest from those tired of the \"by the numbers\" approach to electronic dance music.\n\n\n\nThe adage, \"You have your whole life to make your first album, and a year to make the second\" felt particularly apt, and it wasn't until 2002 that another full-length album of music by Hrvatski was released, this time on Mike Paradinas' Planet µ label.\n\n\n\nBy this time I had already begun focusing my efforts on recording and performing more abstract, less rhythm-based music, and had begun releasing records under my own name of digital minimalism and improvised guitar-computer pieces. I occasionally revisit the moniker for remix requests and the occasional single or compilation track.\"\n\n\n\n- Keith Fullerton Whitman, March 7th, 2005.",
