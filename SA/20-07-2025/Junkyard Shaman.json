This cassette-only release is built from coastal field recordings, and it's a piece designed to decay, fully revealing itself only as the tape wears down and the sounds merge into an indistinct, eroded mass.\n\n\n\nNOTE: This work is not digital and does not include download. It is only on tape, limited to 120 copies, released by Satatuhatta, 2025.",

To my surprise, I for some reason started to play things I had not done in many years, maybe after moving from Finland. I started to see some of those long winter nights from when I last did something like this, and it made me feel strangely nostalgic. Not in the way that I would like to return to any of it, but in the way that I was half here, half there, 7000 kilometers and 10 years away.",

My life is being thrown around by forces larger than my own strength, and there is not much I can do about it, besides drift with it wherever it takes me. \n\nI am grateful to the sea, for it has given me comfort and a sense of beauty, it has taught me things about this universe that I can never be able to express in any language. It is flowing energy, eternal poetry.\n\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this.",

      "about": "Album consisting of two recordings. 1st one being Live recording from Environment 0g, Osaka, 8th of December 2024, performed with the butoh by Iori Kinki. The second one being live recording from many years ago in Finland, recorded at my studio space sometime between 2015-2018. Second one comes as a bonus track for those who buy the album. Also very limited CD-Rs available.\n\n\n\n\"”残骨礼拝”, \"Wreckage Worship\" from Junkyard Shaman, Jere Kilpinen. Cool! Too cool! It's a two-song album, and the first one has the usual \"Japanese Ritual\" atmosphere, and features saxophone and voice, so you can feel the \"movement\". The second song is amazing! He just strums the fuzz guitar. And it's a pretty roaring psychedelic sound! ️I wonder if this is his roots? It makes me think so. It seems to be a live recording, but it's also typical of him not to do anything stupid.\" Kimihide Kusafuka/K2",

      "about": "これって、昔と将来の詩、無くしたもの、忘れたもの、見つかったもの、失敗したもの、その中で僕の失敗のような人生の一番大切な宝物もある。そうして失句集、シックシュウって呼んでます。この詩はよくライプの時も使いますね、音楽に合わせてやりますけれども、𠮷原幸子の朗読のテープをユーチューブで聞くと、自分の詩もこんな風に保存したくなってきた。\n\n私にはいつも詩人本人の朗読のは何となくすごく大切なものだと思いました。それはこの世の魔法術だね。意識の中に、言葉が新しい世界を作ってるし、その中で誰かほかの人の意識が自分の本音で響くから、素晴らしい体験だと思います。自分はそんなことが出来るかどうかわからないんだけれども、こんな風にも、言葉だけで自分の世界を建てられたかった。\n\n\n\nThese are poems I have recorded on tape, poems that I use during live performances. Some of them are from my previous books, some of them will be on the next one in the future. \n\nTo me, poets and artists reading their own works has always been a magical thing. Words build up a world inside another persons consciousness, a world within which some other persons true voice is resonating and living inside another mind. I do not know whether I can achieve that or not, but I wanted to have this kind of record of the poetry and my consciousness at this stage of my life. \n\n\n\nI also want to release this in tape or CD, if someone is interested.",

      "about": "Haihtuma, Finnish for Evaporation.\n\n\n\nThis is something I recorded today, after spending a couple of days thinking of transience of everything, changes, and my life. Many changes appear to happen slowly when you are living your daily life, but when you are cut off of it and then suddenly put back few months later, everything has suddenly changed almost beyond recognition. I knew it was coming, but I did not expect it to happen yet. \n\n\n\nWhat was mine is now evaporating. \n\nWhat comes after will be for somebody else. \n\n\n\nhaihtuma、フィンランド語って蒸発っていう意味です。\n\n\n\nこれは今日録音した瞑想で、この大阪帰った時から色々な変わったことを見て、人生の無常なことを反省したことの作品です。日常に生きてたら、人生は中々変わらなさそうだけど、しばらくに離れると、全部は突然もうわからないぐらいに変わってきたような感じです。これも、いつか起きるのを分かったのに、こんなに早く起きるのを思わなかった。\n\n\n\n私があったことはもう蒸発されゆく。\n\nこれからのことは誰かほかの人のことだろう。",

In my mind, this kind of sound is always connected deeply to snow, darkness and beautiful light of winter afternoon.\n\n\n\n I hope you enjoy it.\n\nAs I am doing all my music now without any aid of computers, the volume level might be slightly lower than your average edm bangers, but I believe you are all wise and considerate people who can committ to the music you are listening to enough to turn the volume up a tiny bit, or even better, make your environment more quiet.\n\nQuite often, especially lately, I have been thinking of words by Yamashita Nobuko, an experimental film maker who I played with in few events. She spoke about the contrast between film and modern world, how everybody wants to have huge, bright screens that show you everything in super HD all the time, but her work is dark, small, hard to see.. it won't get any bigger, you need to get closer. You need to make the effort. I loved that, and her works.\n\n You do not need to see all of the world all the time.\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload comes with selected photographs.",

      "about": "This is my 5 seasons. \n\nIt might sound different if I would have been priviledged enough to have an access to a classical orchestra or even a group of friends and enough time to work in peace, but that is not my reality, so as always, I worked on it alone and without \"proper\" equipment. I think in the end it made it better. My life is a life of natural flow and rhythm. \n\nIt is also a life of liminality and changes. In my mind there are two worlds. That of Japan, which has the natural, cyclic sense of year, where at every season something beautiful blooms and comes to life, but also perpetually dies in order to give birth to something beautiful and new. The other one is the nature of Finland which still lingers on in my memories, that in which the life is short and death is long, spring and summer are brief sparks of life that slowly decay into darkness and cold, silent seasons of death. But within that death, there is also beauty and life. The gravity of a silent snowflake as it falls down in the dark night, the patience of the pine trees as they wait for the spring sun to make the snow heavy enough to melt and let it fall off to the ground...the perpetually repeating cycles of life. \n\n\n\nRebirth. \n\nSomething my body and mind also go through each year. The rhythm and flow of nature. The big, beautiful loop that has always been the base of my expression.\n\n I use loops, because they are the most natural thing, repeating, but never remaining exactly the same, spiralling out, changing unnoticeably, until they become something completely different altogether... that is the natural rhythm and flow of my music.",

      "about": "Released by Satatuhatta, 1st of January 2024.\n\n\n\nThis is an album of my zen buddhist shakuhachi practice. It connects the industrial world and nature, metal percussion and bamboo, brought together by human body, human spirit.\n\n\n\nExcerpt from the liner notes;\n\n\"...my path of blowing zen is that of the Unborn Zen. It has no strict limitations, it has no schools, no intention to attain anything from it, it has no intention of becoming better or achieving some higher end; it is just sound. Accompanied by a self-made metal percussion instrument, it is the sound I want to hear existing in this world of endless separate forms, and all the way within it, lies the reality of the Unborn Mind.\n\n\n\nI grew up in the very back end of a Finnish countryside, surrounded\n\nby rusty, broken cars and industrial machinery my family members used for parts. From very early on, I grew to love the sound of metal and glass, wood, stones, the rural and industrial soundscapes of machines and nature entwined together during the field work.\n\n\n\nMy first experiences of making music were of screeching the sides of a broken cars with sharp sticks, breaking glass bottles underneath our shed and just existing with the sounds surrounding me. For some reason, I always felt like my silence, my presence in space, was active part of being within the entirety of it. I was there, be it in the forest or at the abandoned sauna or at the edge of a field or river, and I decided to do nothing. I did not want to stain it with myself, as it was perfect just the way it was.\"\n\n-Jere Kilpinen / Junkyard Shaman\n\n\n\n\n\nI will get my copies later and will sell them mostly on live shows, so find yours through Satatuhatta or different distros. \n\nsatatuhatta.bandcamp.com/album/the-unborn",

First one recorded at Marcos Nostalgy, 5th of February 2023, the second at Environment 0g, 20th of August 2023. \n\n\n\nI prefer performing with butoh artists, because I feel like my music has been more influenced by their art and my own woodblock prints, than any other musician or music. Especially with Iori, I feel like he is a perfect avatar for the music, the flesh of my bone sounds, reaching out into the space. I have loved every single time we have got to play together and look forward to everything in the future. \n\n\n\nOn the second performance I only used the metal sculpture outside Environment 0g, shakuhachi, and some random pieces of junk metal and ceramics I had brought with me.",

The other day I had a conversation with a friend, which inspired me to do a set of prints. \n\n\n\nExperimenting with those prints inspired me to write a poem, which again evolved into further print. I thought of using that as a sort of mental notation for the live show yesterday, record that and put it out. I also recorded the poem and used it during the live performance.\n\n\n\nI did record it, but I realized I messed it up. Nevertheless, the poem on the tape, and the final soundloop used in the performance were still there, so I began this work from where yesterday's performance ended up. \n\nDownload comes with photos of the prints.",

Made in order to try to cleanse my soul of all the mud of self-doubt, grief, loneliness... \n\n\n\nI found this tuning originally by accident by randomly downtuning my acoustic guitar without thinking, then struck a chord and instantly knew there were no accidents. I have been using it ever since, as it appears to most precisely fit my soul.\n\n\n\n大阪の雨の日には一行で作ったアルバムで、自分の魂を悲しみ、さみしさと自己不信感の泥より清めますように。\n\n\n\nこのチューニングって、初めて偶然にアコースティックギターを無意識でチューニングして、コードを叩いたら、絶対偶然じゃないのを分かりました。そこからこの同じチューニングをよく使います。自分の気に合う感じです。",

I am forever grateful for Haji Kiyoharu and Konohana Garan, as all my current activities spawned from various small accidents and coinsidences, all of which I can directly trace back to that day when I walked in through that door.\n\n\n\nas En in Japanese can mean many things, among those are these two kanjis, the other meaning circle, which was quite present in the content of my exhibition, and the other meaning fate or connection, something really unexplainable in any other language than Japanese.\n\n\n\nCD version comes with a recording also released earlier, recorded at Kyoto's Ootsubunonamida at the end of last year.",

The idea of these albums was to simulate my consciousness collaged as sound, with ill remembered memories mixing up with vanishing dreams and subconscious hallucinations. On this last one I also wanted to bring in the approach of breaking down the architecture of language and therefore the consciousness and mind itself.\n\n\n\nTape released by the suberb Sata Tuhatta Tapes, order tapes through them; \n\nsatatuhatta.bandcamp.com/album/lost-mind\n\n  Thank you!",

Side A is poems in Japanese, new poems and shorter pieces from my two books 小さい秘密の本 and　残り灰, both released 2022. Side B is poems in Finnish from a still unreleased book of poems. Digital download comes with photos of the new poems, alternative artwork, track with only the poems without the noise machine and also a live recording from reading performance at Environment 0g, 26th of August, 2022.\n\nAlbeit a very nisché thing, if somebody wants to put this out as a small tape release, I will provide handmade artwork for it. Contact me through the contact form.\n\n\n\nこのリリースって色々な朗読の作品ですね。自作のノイズ機械を使って、小さい秘密の本と残り灰から読んでた。新しい詩も入っています、次の本にそれを入れるつもりです。ダウンロードのボーナスコンテンツは写真とか、アルバムアートとか、ライブ朗読の録音とノイズなしで朗読したファイルがあります。日本語で確かに間違えていたり、発音も読むときあちこちにおかしいですけど、それでもこれをリリースをしたかった。今の状況記念みたいにかもしれない。B面でフィンランド語の詩が入ってます。この二つの言語は自分の心の言葉みたいに考えていますので、こういう風にそれを一緒にさせたいました。いつも支えてくれた皆様、本当にありがとうございます。\n\nこれからもよろしくお願いします。",

My intuition about people is pretty strong, and when I first met Jerry it almost made me laugh when, as soon as he opened the door behind me, the voice in the back of my mind said \"THIS. PAY ATTENTION.\". I knew improvisation would work well, we played once live last year and it did, but maybe because it was too easy it took a longer time to materialize. But it did, and I am glad. \n\n\n\nWe recorded all of this in about 1 hour, it was relaxed and nice session, and we both mixed and compositioned our own versions of this and released them separately. I really like Jerry's version, so go give it a listen too! Also check out his book Terminalian Drift, which is really good.  \n\nmoontriangle.bandcamp.com/album/a-bed-for-a-ghost",

Last night when it was raining hard I ran myself to exhaustion and then ran some more. It was perfect moment in its own cathartic way. \n\n\n\nThis album is mostly lingerings on the peace I felt last week when me and my friends took a trip to the mountains. I needed the mountains and the rivers more than I had given myself a permission to think of. Those forests made me think of the forests I grew up in, completely different but still exactly the same, singing the same songs here that they taught me as a child 7000 kilometres away. I feel grateful for the pain that drove me into the woods. It gave me something not a single human being can imitate or take away. Nature taught me everything I know.",

      "about": "This album is not a display of my mastery of shakuhachi (for there is none), but more of impressions of places and the shape of my spirit at a certain time at a certain place. Sometimes I wanted to talk to the birds, sometimes to imitate and express the movement of a shadow or wind in the grass. It is not \"music\" in the sense of \"music\", but certain captured moments in this universe. Recorded at various times and places, including Kazefukeiwa, Hieizan, and a riverside at Osaka.\n\n\n\nこのアルバムって、自分の尺八のスキルの説明ではない。これはあの一瞬の説明で、行ってた所の感覚とか、自分の精神のあの時の形の説明と思います。\n\n時々鳥に話したかったとか、陰の動くか風の通りに吹きたかったとか。\n\nほとんど音楽じゃないですが、この宇宙で、この人生の中で起きた一瞬の録音だと思います。\n\n色々な場所で録音されまして、例えば風吹岩、比叡山と大阪の福の川の岸で演奏していました。\n\nこれで自分の心を清めたいです。\n\n聴いてくれたら、ありがとうございます。",

      "about": "先日には街に散歩したときこの写真を見つかって、写真で小さなメセージが貼ってありました。「子供は６ジ食べます」と書いてある。誰かはベイビシッターへ説明を書いて、あの方は今道にそれを捨てて、僕は偶然にそれを見つかった。そんな小さな起きることはすごく面白い。そこから頭の中ずっとそれを考えてた。ゆっくり音楽も現れてもらった。その子どもたちの音楽。存在ない子供には作った音楽です。自分の子供時代の感じがさせてしたかった。ムーミンアニメのような音楽だけど、私の心から出たので、いつも最初に思ったより悲しい出てるちゃう、と思います。\n\n\n\nThe other day, when I took a walk in the city, I found this photo and posted a small message on it. It says, \"Children eat at 6.\" Someone wrote an explanation to the baby sitter, they threw it away, and now I happened to find it. It's very interesting to have such a small thing happen. From there I was thinking about it all the time in my head. The music appeared slowly. The children's music. It's music made for children who don't exist. It made me feel like my childhood. It's music like Moomin anime, but it came out of my heart, so I think it's always sadder than I first thought.",

Where are we now? Am I doing it now? The disruption of information, the thought of not being able to take any of this in order to make the future easier, being doomed from the start, stuck in an endless unbroken loop, eternally stuck, eternally repeating, eternally crawling through the same hole, eternally neglected childhood, eternally lost, eternally dying, billions and billions of deaths, in this exact same flesh, exactly the same consciousness, everything repeating exactly the same...\n\nNothing was ever better\n\nand never will be.\"\n\n\n\nTitles picked up from Samuel Beckett's Texts for Nothing",

I was tempted to name this Gutaigagaku (具体雅楽) since to me this sounds like what gagaku might sound like if it was filtered through gutai spirit, using everyday junk instruments. \n\n\n\nGagaku is the traditional court music of Japan, that came through China. It relies on long suspended drones and repetition, and I first heard it as a child from a CD-ROM dictionary we had with our very early PC. It blew me away instantly. I knew THIS was music. Real music. Nothing like I had ever heard before. REAL MUSIC, nature of sound itself, breaths, hearts, blood circulation, spirit unfolding, memory, consciousness. Real music. It changed the way I perceived music and certainly played a huge influence on how I started making music. I didn't care for chords or structures or melodies, I just rather play one wave of sound until it makes me see things. And little by little it has evolved, through years of practice, with every iteration, into something like this. \n\n\n\nGutai is a post-war avantgarde movement that started here in Osaka with Jiro Yoshihara in 1950's and ended with his death in 1972, after which many of the remaining artist spread the Gutai spirit on to new generation of artists. I have had the honor to get to know these artists and participate in the performances and see the exhibitions, and it has had an huge impact on my art too. It had made me feel like I have found a home, something that comes to me naturally and makes my brain light up like fireworks while thinking of work. What always annoyed my with Fluxus for example, was the same thing that annoyed Duchamp, they just took what Dada did, and over rationalized it and forced it into words. Killed it. In Gutai, words are unnecessary. It is something more profound, as the name dubs it, \"concrete\". You feel it in your gut.",

      "about": "Years ago we made a short interview with a Finnish self-proclaimed witch who said something that has echoed in my mind ever since. He said that back during the cold war when people were making nuclear tests when he was a child, he could feel the resonance of the bombs in his bones, he could feel the suffering of earth in his body. For some reason I have been thinking of that image a lot lately. \n\nProbably more after watching Akira Kurosawa's Rhapsody in August, where there's a scene where the classmates of the children who died in the Nagasaki bombing, now old people themselves, go plant flowers on the memorial statue each year. I think that is one of the strongest images in any movie ever. Perseverance and humanity standing in the face of our own horrid destruction, all this suffering we are causing to each other and this earth. Why does it appear to be so fucking hard to be a human and treat each other and this earth with kindness and care?",

      "about": "This album was recorded a year ago, in October 2019, in a rental studio in Osaka, Japan. It was born out of my experiments with playing guitar in the way Japanese biwa is played. I came up with the tuning that would allow me to bend the notes more freely, and would resonate with me emotionally. I originally did not release this due to the recording quality which I thought to be sub par, which might be sort of ironic thought in the head of a musician that has done mostly just lo-fi noises and junk music. But I think the emotional response gets translated, maybe even enhanced due to the recording quality. \n\n\n\nIn a way, this is my scroll of guitar. Every aspect of my playing is in these works, and if one studies it thoroughly, they understand how my mind works.",

I dropped rocks on the strings and all the sounds are basically just stones from the sky. \n\n\n\nI Regret Nothing was a first guitar drone piece I have played in a long while and I felt like these two belonged together. They appear to me as two different apparitions of the same essence.\n\n\n\nThe album artwork is a three color woodcut print I made just for this purpose.",

Experimenting with different compositional and instrumental choices in order to make time float. To achieve indifference, the sense of meaninglessness that sitting in silence produces. \n\n\n\nThese pieces include experiments with acoustic guitar, shakuhachi, tape loops, drones and mental landscapes.",

Visions from the junkyards, fringes of everyday life, dreams from the future. It is interaction of dead, abandoned things, giving life to the lifeless, letting the junk sing and dance around in their bones..",

      "about": "Recorded live at Romu & Random, Tampere 11th of January 2018 with all the room ambience noises and beer cans and whatever there were. It was a collective hypnosis and of course this is nothing compared to actually being there, existing in the same space, but I want to share this because it was a very special night. Everything was just perfect. I was in the right place and time, for once in my life. This is one live performance cut in three pieces due to the restrictions of Bandcamp.",

This is a dadaist sound collage/installation of my brain. \n\n\n\nFew years back I made this Outo Piiri I tape, which was made from instrument tracks of different songs, spoken word poetry and field recordings, this is pretty much the follow up for that.These are also tape loops I have used while playing live. I would upload first one too, but I haven't had it since I sold them out pretty much instantly. There is a limited tape edition of this, this is of course best experienced from an old, recycled tape. None of this music has existed in this form before, but some of the material might be familiar from the past. \n\n\n\nThis album is also a conceptual soundtrack for my new poetry book Metadada, which is available (ONLY IN FINNISH) 20th of October, 2018.",

      "about": "This is a sound installation I created with Terhi Eskelinen to accompany Henri Ijäs' conceptual art installation \"Observation Tree\" which inspired the whole soundscape right then and there. The piece was formerly owned by Aapo Korkeaoja, and it observed the ownership of art. Tree itself is picked up from the ground and the roots are put on display at Korkeaoja, in conceptual art exhibition Käsitekesä 2018. It is possible to visit the exhibition until August 2018. Google provides you with further information.\n\n\n\nWith this sound installation I think I managed to bring another aspect to this piece, turning the focus from ownership to the questions of power and powerlessness, nature did all the work growing the tree while human beings claim ownership over it, while it itself is left without a voice. All in all standing there, sheltered from the rain, observing the tree under one spotlight with this soundscape was a very immersive and meditative experience. So this is a conceptual collaboration of many different aspects, sound being only one of them.",

Kaikkein kamalinta modernille ihmiselle on istua viisitoista minuuttia yksin omien \najatustensa kanssa, koska meidän ajatuksemme ovat pahin vihollisemme, jatkuvasti huutava suu ja kiristelevät hampaat joita joudumme\ntuijottamaan kahdenkymmenen sentin päästä, ajatusten vihainen virta, loputon vuoksi joka huuhtoo meidät kohti kurimusta jos annamme sille \nvallan. \nTästä syystä en koskaan luota ihmisiin, elleivät he ole osoittaneet osaavansa olla hiljaa puoli tuntia kerrallaan, ilman pakonomaista \ntarvetta häiritä meitä molempia puhumalla jatkuvasti koko ajan. Nämä ovat viimeiset sanani ihmiskunnan tuleville polville, viimeiset limaiset\n sanat jotka karkaavat huuliltani ja tahraavat meidät kaikki syyllisyydellä..\nMe olemme kaikki vankeja tässä maailmassa. Jos et kykene katsomaan\nvanginvartijaa silmästä silmään, et koskaan tule löytämään ovea ulos. Ulkona odottaa vain tyhjä tila, sama kylmä tyhjyys joka täyttää\ntämän huoneen, huoneen jossa väsymys on ase joka on painettu ohimoani vasten, kylmä paino vasten tykyttävää otsasuonta, suonissani kiertää jäätä ja olen valmis jättämään teidät kaikki taakseni. \nTäyttämään kylmän tyhjän huoneen kaipauksella ja lämmöllä, jota en osannut ilmaista, mutta jonka toivon jäävän perääni teidän muistoihinne. Jokaikinen päivä täällä on ollut taas yksi uusi päivä helvetissä.\nJoka ikinen päivä on yksi päivä lisää painoa jalkoihin, taas kasa muistoja jotka tekevät lähdöstä aina vain vaikeampaa ja raskaampaa.\nMitä useamman vuoden täällä olen, sitä vähemmän olen odotuksia ja sitä enemmän olen muistoja. Se on kai ihmisen kohtalo ja tila, odottaa\njotain mikä ei tapahdu, tulla kasaksi muistoja ja menettää kaikki odotukset, vaeltaa kahleet jalassa päivästä toiseen näitä katuja joilla\nkasvot käyvät vieraammiksi ja paikat oudommiksi, sinun muistosi lanataan pois uusien ihmisten muistojen tieltä ja tajuat, ettei tämä enää\nole sinun maailmasi ensinkään. Lopulta olet vain varjo menneestä maailmasta, irti omasta ajastasi, elänyt liian pitkään vain koska et osannut\nkuolla silloin kuin sinun piti.. Nämä ovat viimeiset sanani ihmiskunnan tuleville polville, viimeiset limaiset sanat jotka karkaavat \nhuuliltani ja hämmentävät tulevia polvia vielä vuosikymmenten kuljettua ohitseni ja jätettyä minut ruostumaan itsekseni.."

It's all there. I might not now, but the guitar does. \n\n\n\nMarras is Finnish and means a dead or dying human being, omens of death, souls of the dead or just the slow decay in general.",

Whole thing seemed to have a cocky approach to it (\"can you do it...?\") so I figured I go way beyond it. I came up with at first 14 different experimental ways to record a song, and then came up with few extras too. All in all I wrote 21 songs in February. The name tells it all, whether it be recorded blindfolded or without hearing any backing tracks, played in reverse or having a printer as a drum machine. I had fun, and I'll probably do it again next year.",

Kylmät kiviseinät imevät hehkulampun vähäisen sähkövalon, hengittävät ulos hometta jota sinä hengität sisään. \nKeuhko kurtistuu ja rahisee voimattomana.\nVoit nähdä jo ihosi lävitse, \nnähdä valheesi läpi siihen luuttomaan ytimeen, \njoka velloo kaiken lian ja saastan alla. \nKaiken sen pehmeän liman ja kudoksen keskellä pieni, kova kimpale, jota joskus kutsuit sieluksesi, mutta jota et tunnista enää. \nSykkeen ainoa tehtävä on kuljettaa verta aivoihin, jotta voisit tuntea edes pienen plasebon verran kaikuja menneestä onnesta, \nkaikista niistä elämäsi ensimmäisistä kerroista\njotka vielä tuottivat iloa, mutta se kaikki on nyt takana päin. \nTuli toinen kerta, tuli sadas kerta, hehku himmeni ja sammui, jätti jälkeensä enää janon ja kylmyyden. \nRuumiisi on pelkkä kylmiö jossa säilytät riippuvuuttasi. Tyhjä tila joka humisee ja kaikuu sisältä. \nItseviha ei tee mistään helpompaa, mutta ei se mitään vaikeutakaan. Se vain on ylläsi paksun repaleisen peiton tavoin, jotain lapsuudesta tuttua jota olet saanut kantaa mukanasi läpi kaiken sen paskan, jonka keskellä olet ryöminyt. \nLämpötila on enää 30 astetta. Väsymys on ylitsepääsemätön seinä, etkä voi olla sulkematta silmiäsi, hetkiseksi vain..."

Ruumiit kulkevat kaduilla vakuutellen itselleen olevansa elossa, peittäen luonnollisen kuolemansa merkit uusilla naamioilla, mädäntyen sisältä omista rakenteistaan kuin homeiset kerrostalot. Toiset väistelevät todellisuutta kaikin mahdollisin keinoin. Ilta illan jälkeen kauppakeskuksissa jonotetuille ilmaisille ämpäreille keksitään uusia käyttötarkoituksia tehokkaammin, kuin mitä lainsäätäjät kerkeävät julistaa laittomaksi. Toiset todellisuus hakkaa joka ilta. Nyrjähtäneitä niveliä, poikki napsahtaneita luita, ruumiit ovat rytmikkäitä soittimia.\nVeri kohisee aivoissa kuljettaen happea ja hallusinaatioita, hetkellisiä harhoja ilosta ja onnesta, haihtuvia usvaisia pilviä, jotka jättävät jälkeensä näivettyneen olon.\nKaikkialla katukuvassa läpinäkyvät romun tykittäjät paistattelevat limaisina alkukevään kylmän auringon paisteessa. Joku ohikulkija astuu yhden päälle, jalka uppoaa lihaan kuin hyytelöön ja jättää jälkeensä opiaatin katkuisen löyhkän. \nAskelten tasaisessa kopsahtelevassa rytmissä on yksi kostea tauko, muuten kukaan ei huomaa mitään eroa. Kaikki jatkuu kuten ennenkin. Kurjat ruumiit pitävät omaa rytmikästä meluaan. Ruumiiden rakentamat koneet hurisevat ja kolisevat ja rämisevät asfaltilla. Raha vaihtaa taskua. Ihmisiä syntyy ja kuolee.  Veri kohisee aivoissa kuin ennenkin. Kalmiossa on kaikki ennallaan.."

      "about": "\"She took a deep breath and leaned back in her chair. The gas fumes went straight up to her head and lit her brains with thousands of weird and unexpected connections. She felt lightheaded and fuzzy. Somehow through the curtain of I-don’t-give-a-fuck she managed to understand that she was in a seated position, sitting in an old arm-chair. Slowly the reality around her started to mold itself into a living room. A small coffee table right in front of her, an empty bookshelf to her right. Her wrists were aching for all the masturbation, but she couldn’t really help herself. The butane induced serenity was the only thing keeping her from beginning all over. She didn’t even care. She was far out. And for a brief moment she felt better than in months. Life didn’t seem as unbearable when she was high. Nothing was unbearable when she was high. She played with the thought of exhausting her brain of all oxygen and just slipping through the sweet haze that would carry her off the edge of time and space and into the infinite, calm bliss of death, but somehow it made her feel uneasy. Not yet. Not just yet, she thought to herself as her fingers slid across the vast plains of her smooth skin..\"",

Knives and forks.\n\n\n\nIt's a sort of a loose theme album about a doomsday cult on a desert, losing their faith and getting filled with doubt and paranoia, but committing a mass suicide nevertheless.",

Oliko jumala hyljännyt heidät tällaisella hetkellä, juuri nyt? Juuri maailmanlopun edessä? Lahkon johtaja levitteli käsiään ja toisti pyyntöään rukoushuoneen hiljaiselle katolle. Ilma oli sähköinen, bensa haisi, kaikki tuijottivat kattoa odottaen jumalan kaikkivoipaa kättä, joka koska tahansa nostaisi katon paikaltaan ja tempaisisi heidät kaikki ylös taivaaseen. Väkijoukossa kiersi jo myrkkymalja, josta jokainen vuorollaan joi. Lahkon johtaja näytti äkkiä niin pieneltä, niin hauraalta ja heikolta. Tämäkö oli se suuri ja karsimaattinen johtaja, jonka vuoksi he olivat jättäneet maaallisen elämän taakseen? Tämä oli se ihmeellinen parantaja, se suuri messias, jota he kaikki olivat seuranneet? Kynttilät valaisivat hiljaisuutta, paljastivat rivin toisensa jälkeen aavemaisia, kalpeita kasvoja. Aavemaisiksi ne teki ennen kaikkea se epävarmuus joka niiltä paistoi tämän uuden käänteen edessä. Jumala ei vastannutkaan heille. Jumala ei vastannutkaan heille, jumala ei vastaisikaan heille.. Hiljainen mutina alkoi kiertää väkijoukon seassa. Se ei silti estänyt jokaista vuorollaan juomasta maljasta lisää. Johtaja laski kätensä, kääntyi seurakuntansa puoleen ja alkoi laulaa hiljaa. Hän lauloi heidän virsiään, lopun ajan kansan lauluja, hän lauloi ja seurakunta yhtyi lauluun kunnes se yltyi huudoksi. Koko seurakunta oli nyt saanut myrkkynsä, hetki oli käsillä. Ensimmäiset alkoivat jo luhistua penkeillä. Pian jäljellä oli enää johtaja, joka sytytti verhot tuleen ja mutisi liekkien keskeltä:\n\"VIELÄ TULEE AIKA, JOLLOIN JUMALAT KUISKIVAT PELOISSAAN JA KAIVATEN IHMISTEN NIMIÄ...\""

It was all alike, all the same, all exactly the same. No difference whatsoever.\nEverywhere I went, everywhere I turned my head\nit was all the same, color of the burnt dirt\nColor of my father's eyes, the deep gray all over.\nI thought this would purify me, I thought this would cleanse me, I thought this would save me.\nBut I should already know there is no such thing as redemption. We are all cursed, all abandoned, all alike. All burnt dirt. Just waiting to be wiped away.\nDo I sound depressing? I apologize, for that is not my intention. My intention is solely to amuse, but as you probably noticed, my sense of humour is kinda bleak. I've seen too many politicians spewing filth upon good people, I've seen too many priests abusing the trust of the innocent, I've seen far too many mothers killing their children to believe in good. I've seen the fathers break their son's legs and tell them to run. I've heard the snap of the bone, seen a limb give up under pressure.\nI wipe the spit off my lips. I need to calm down, I know, I know. \nThis city is a dead rat, an empty bomb shell,\na forgotten grave on the side of the road.\nIt's full of dead people who just weren't told they were supposed to die a long time ago. \nThey think it all will turn out good in the end. \nBut there will be no end. They will never see such thing. There is none.\n----\nMy eyes are filled with doubt\nMy skull is full of mud\nI try to open my dry mouth\nbut I find it's sewn shut\nI hope to find a way\nto understand my own position\nand to ease this fix by approximation\nBut I find it's not my decision.\nI can't be held responsible\nfor all the mumble I release\nIt's always just an attempt to find\na temporary ease\nSo please, if you do mind anything I say\nJust strangle me with piano-wire and\nmake me go away.\nFor I am not here to irritate\nI am not here to amuse either.\nI am here to prove a point and to \nburn alive in front of your eyes.\nI am here to burn\nI am here to burn\nI am here to burn alive\nUntil I'm nothing but dust."

          "lyrics": "The mouldy floorboards were covered with cockroaches.\nSomeone had knocked a half-empty bag of crisps off the counter\nand the vermin were enjoying their feast, salt & vinegar\nremains of someones breakfast or lunch or whatever.\nThe flat was cold, the heating had gone off long ago.\nAt the far end corner, on a rugged mattress there was a \nshivering, tired ruin of a young man crying.\nHe did not mind the insects, that were crawling on his floor,\nhe did not mind the cold, he did not mind the fact\nhis life had had no meaning in a long while,\nhe did not even mind the fact that he might be about to die.\nActually, that was the only portion of his life\nhe seemed to wait anxiously.\nDeath seemed like an first price on the sucking competition\nhe called his life. It seemed like every single decision,\nusually a bad one, was leading towards this final culmination point:\ndying in a rented apartment at some suburbia,\nwith his veins so empty of drugs he could feel the\ncold in his bones. Not on his skin, though.\nIt seemed like his skin would be on fire, stung with thousands of tiny needles,\nlike all the cockraches would be right there under his skin,\nlike all the knives in the world would be stored inside his body.\nHe felt kinda bad, but he could remember one morning worse than this.\nAlthough it seemed distant now, when he was wallowing\nin his current ocean of disgust and pain.\nIt was rare that he could actually remember feeling worse in this sort of state,\nbut you can understand it feels like the worst hangover ever, when you wake up\nwithout three of your toes and out of money, food or drugs.\nYoung man turned around on his side, watched the cockroaches devour his crisps,\nbut didn't know what to think of it. It had been his last money, but it was yesterday.\nThis was a new day. A new beginning. A new hell. \nHe tried to get up, but he couldn't. His body was too weak and the pain was overwhelming.\nHe made a noise of some sort, it was a long, moany groan, and the cockroaches fleed.\nThey had learned to avoid his wrath, his leather boots made messy remarks of too slow\ninsects on the floor. \"Note to the rest: Run faster.\"\nHe was sure he would die, he would freeze and starve to death. \nBut eventually the knives under his skin smoothened their edges, \nsharp pain became blunt pain\nand his eyes adjusted to the painful light.\nHe gathered his strength and rose to his feet, like the first mammal ever to attempt\nwalking on two feet, out of balance, disoriented.\nHe took slow, careful steps and crushed the crisps on the floor.\nHe got out of the door, in to the small corridor, went to the first floor\nand out of the door. He went outside, and saw a homeless guy on a dirty street.\nThere was graffiti on the nearby wall and the wind was restlessly kicking around\nyesterday's newspaper. He passed the homeless person who was left staring at his back,\nhe passed the graffiti, he passed the newspaper, he crossed the street and went to a nearby shop.\nHe stole a Kitkat and ate it as soon as he got out. \nIt tasted better than anything he had ever eaten before.\nHe looked down at his shoes. They were almost worn out, \nthey wouldn't crush insects for long.\nHe sighed. His life was way too hard to be dealt with right now.\nHe wanted nothing more than a fix. A justification for his guilt, anything at all.\nHe felt sick, he felt like he could not live with his self. \nHe could not live without a fix and couldn't live if he got one.\nHe'd probably just overdose and get it over with.\nLife, when did you become so intolerable, he thought to himself as he\ncrawled back into his hell."

It's all so easy to say\nthat you'll be here tomorrow when you can't stay.\nLife assumes you take care of yourself, \nbecause no one else will.\nUnless the people around you will.\nSo you better take care of them too,\nor they might not give two shits about you."

      "about": "I had bought myself a worn out old Ford. It wasn’t an actual beauty, but it sure was cheap. As a matter of fact it was the ugliest one in the shop, which in itself was a sheer horror show. Everything was greasy and dirty and they played some shitty music on the radio, you know, the kind of up-tempo songs with minor chords and some sevenths here and there to make everyone feel even more miserable. The owner seemed to have given up on his employees. That slimy car salesman had promised me it would not get me past thousand miles. I took it. I just wanted to drive to the desert, for once not to think about any consequences of my actions, just DO IT! And I did it. I drove on into the night, down the dirt road as fast as I could. I knew not what awaited me at the end of that road, I did not know, nor did it matter, since it was the road I had chosen to drive until the car would run out of gasoline or I would simply collapse. I had no further intentions whatsoever, just to drive, drive, drive into the break of dawn, into the arms of tomorrow, to drive towards my freedom.\n\n\n\nI had walked for hours, but the darkness seemed unbreakable, as though it would have been only thickening around me since the beaten up car ran out of gas. I did not mind, though it was cold, it was silent. Lizards and vultures escaped me as I tried to find my way through the darkness. Moon seemed like a huge bowl of moldy soup in the dark sky, but it helped me see as soon as my eyes got used to it’s dim light. The desert seemed to weave a web of tranquility around my nerves, I hoped this night would never come to an end, I was hoping maybe this could be the night I'd depart from my flesh. Although the thought had always terrified me, I thought there would be no better time. Right here, right now. It would be a life complete. It would be a destiny fulfilled. \n\n\n\nWhen the stars started to blend into the twilight of a new dawn, I could not believe I was still amongst the living. I kept walking, for there was pretty much nothing else one could do in the desert without any other mean of transportation than one’s own two good feet. I passed a skeleton of a bovine creature of some sort, seeing death \"live\" sent chills down my spine and brought back the love for this flesh, these mortal eyes that one day would stare blindly into the break of another dawn, not recognizing it, not understanding the sight, not having a concept for understanding, not to mention concept of mere existence, my hopes of losing my life seemed like a distant dream, something that had happened to someone else instead of me. I felt like a snake, shedding my old skin, crawling out of my old self, and I understood, that this would be a brand new dawn, like no other I had seen in my whole life. I kept walking, until I found a gas station along the road. It would be a lie to say I didn’t feel disappointed at myself, when I found my weakened hand opening the door and walking in, telling the tired clerk to call an ambulance.",

The first one is a meditation for washing machine, drill, plastic container and several different knives and a cupboard door, the rest of 'em were played with a piano that was made in 1926. I'm quite a minimalist with pianos, because I think the less you play the more it says, and it guides the spirit in a completely different way. It's like zen buddhist painting, with sounds. And in a way it is, because music and sounds are always attached to some sort of images or visions in my head, I see sounds, and hear colors.",

Outside the flourishing, green woods pass by, but as the darkness weaves it's web around the world, I am left to stare at my own reflection in the window. It is like some dirty and scratched mirror, that breaks at every station and shows me another bit of the real world and other people, who watch me watch back at them, tired, uninterested.\n\nTheir world is the world of social interaction, polite questions and even more polite, or in some case clever and witty answers. I could play that game too. I know. I just played it for the last six hours, and it wore me off. My thoughts are drifting and slowly sinking, like some recently dead animal on the surface of a small swampy pond. Probably some careless mammal who got too confident and just a bit too far from the shore.\n\nThe train plunges into a tunnel like some childish movie-metaphor, and the pressure starts fucking my ears...\n\nAnother stop. I am far too bored to watch out of the window anymore. I just sit, let my mind fill these empty seats with people who don't exist. There's the local vet, Mr. Hannigan, sitting next to the butcher, Mr. Flay. They're holding hands at smiling at each other. They won't notice us, no matter how we try to break their eyecontact or shout at them. Right in front of me sits the sweetest old couple imaginable. Mr. and Mrs. Thompson. At nights they like to gag and bound eachother and play all kinds of sadistic games that would make any of us younger passangers flinch. I smile at them and they smile back, simultaneously. Like some old, perverted sex-robots.\n\nI start staring out again... because I'm fucking bored.."

There were many people with me\nAnd we came to this huge and flourishing forest\nIt's roof was of pines and it's floor of moss.\nYou could barely see the sepian sunlight\nsift through the thick branches\nBut everything was quiet\nAnd everything was beautiful.\nBut those who were with me were too busy complaining\nThey could not see the beauty of it all\nThey could not see beauty at all.\nAlthough they were about to drown in it.\nOne by one they were left behind.\nI kept ascending.\nSuddenly I reached the summit.\nIt was completely flat, and there was a river cleaving it right in the middle.\nThe sun was shining, there was no wind, no worries.\nThere was strange sort of symmetry in all this.\nBut even stranger was what I saw in the river.\nThere were white monkeys, playing in the river with small white dogs\nThey were splashing in the water,and the water drops shone in all colors\nImaginable to human mind, like diamonds\nIt was pure elation, happiness portrayed in a mental landscape.\nAnd I could do nothing but stare, and smile. It was mental acid.\nI have never been as happy in my conscious life\nas I was in my unconscious life at that moment\nwatching those white monkeys and those white dogs play.\nI left this all behind. Turned back.\nDescending back to the woods.\nIt was almost dark.\nI tried to convince other people that they should go on climbing\nWhat was waiting on top of that hill was worth all troubles\nBut they had already given up. They had decided to give up.\nAnd they never saw what I saw\nAnd no one never will.\nIt was all a dream.\nAnd now it has ceased to be.\nAnd it exists only in my memory.\nAnd it will tarnish and fade with time.\nUntil it is completely forgotten. \nUntil it is gone."

Probably one reason I enjoy making instrumental music so much is the fact I like reading a lot, and it's great to have instrumental music, that carries emotions, colors your thoughts without interfering you consciousness directly. It speaks to your subconscious and surpasses you. You might not remember a thing about the songs, but you end up feeling something, and from my point of view that is one of the main goals of my music. These are mostly inspired by the works of Hermann Hesse.",

      "about": "The end of the world as I see it. Darker counterpart of the Darkness Infused In Light, psychedelic acoustic music. Whereas the first part was The Spiral, this is The Twisting Pyramid, mankind's collective trauma when the world did not end. No need to worry, we all will end someday. If you download it, you'll get the artwork in a PDF.",
