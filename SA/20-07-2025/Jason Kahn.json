      "about": "A book and composition examining sound and memory in Varanasi.\n\n\n\nEditions 010\n\n\n\nBook:\n\n15x14 cm\n\n60 pages\n\nISBN 978-3-033-07500-9\n\n\n\nCD:\n\nDuration 18.06\n\nSource recordings made February 19-24, 2019 in Varanasi.\n\n\n\nFrom the introduction:\n\nIn common parlance the term Infinity Suite refers to a luxury hotel apartment comprised of several adjoining rooms. But my usage of the term here invokes the notion of infinite realities as resonating through dream and memory. An interconnected suite of spaces populated with vivid sounds and images spanning across periods of one’s life. My experience here focuses on the Indian city of Varanasi, but this sense of reality drifting I found there could’ve taken place anywhere. I focused on Varanasi because I’d been there three times over the span of twenty-four years. And while the very nature of the city, with all its holy sites, pilgrims and seekers of all varieties, lends itself to this sense of different realities blending and distorting. For me a kind of sensorial time warp.\n\n\n\nFrom the main text:\n\nThe most banal sounds of the backstreets often prove to be the most fascinating. Kids reciting lessons together in their classroom, soft voices raining down from hidden places above. Music everywhere. From the radio in a store, in a small temple, someone singing as they sweep their doorstep. And the birds, cows, dogs, cats, an occasional monkey and even a goat. The creak of an old wooden cart straining under its load of empty aluminum milk cans, rattling and shaking to wake the dead. A racket of chanting and drums trailing loudly behind as a corpse takes its last journey to the fires of the cremation ghats smoking away down by the river. Where all is quiet again, aside from the crackle and pop of wood burning and the occasional motorboat creeping slowly across the Ganges like a mechanical water bug.",

      "about": "I wrote the texts in this book as a kind of memorial device to re­cordings I made in Zürich between February 5 to March 22, 2020. Though not a direct reaction to the Covid pandemic, the transfor­mation of the city due to restrictions of movement in the public space made these recordings only first possible in many ways. \n\n\n\nOf course, what immediately became noticeable after the first shutdown of the city occurred was how quiet the normally noisy urban environment had become. It was as though a veil had been lifted between my ears and all the sounds that were normally hidden there. All of a sudden I noticed the birds singing, the sound of a paper wrapper skittering down the sidewalk in the wind, the new-found clarity of church bells ringing near where I lived, how footsteps seemingly exploded over cobblestones or the sound of a fountain, before just a hail of white noise, now resembling more a kaleidoscope of endlessly repeating rhythmic patterns. \n\n\n\nI went out and explored the city anew, with microphone in hand and ears wide open. In the midst of so much tragedy, I was able to salvage something positive and also illuminating, regaining a sense for the audible space of a city I'd lived in for the last twenty years but had until now never really experienced at this level of acute detail and presence.\n\n\n\nI never intended to do anything with these recordings. They were not made with the purpose in mind of using them as material in some composition or exhibition. It was just my way of dealing with a crisis situation and at the same time salvaging something positive out of all the pain and suffering. The recordings remained on my computer for another year when by chance I came across them again and started to give them a listen. Each recording held a wealth of memories which came rushing back as I listened. I was amazed at how intricate details, things I hadn't given any thought to for the last year, were suddenly there in front of me again, vivid and alive, as if they'd happened just a day or two ago.\n\n\n\nI became fascinated with the resonance of my memory and started to write short texts in reaction to each recording, creating a kind of field recording of recollection. Each text draws out what I experienced in sound and feelings from its corresponding recording. There's often an intense focus on sounds but more intriguing I think are how these sounds had an emotional impact on my psychological and spiritual state, often triggering memories from as far back as my childhood. Writing these texts became a journey through a prism of memories, all starting with each of these recordings and sometimes just one singular sound.\n\n\n\nThe recordings I made are included here on CD to provide a basis of comparison for the reader, though I feel they're by no means necessary. Either the texts or the recordings could stand on their own, but placed side-by-side they provide an interesting juxtaposition for the reader to explore. It's not intended that the text or the recordings be read and listened to at the same time, however there is no prescribed method for experiencing this book. The reader should find their own way through these texts and sounds, just as I found my way through the city, following my ears as I made these re­cordings and tracing my memories back through time as I wrote the texts.\n\n\n\nI hope this book inspires other people to explore their own living spaces and to consider how what they're hearing transports them to other states of mind or times in their lives. \n\n\n\n----------------------------------\n\nLangstrasse Pedestrian Underpass\n\n\n\nThis space\n\na swirling\n\nvortex\n\nof trains\n\npassing\n\nabove\n\nvoices out\n\nof nowhere\n\nskaters taking\n\nthe ramped wall\n\nwhile columns\n\nof traffic\n\npass just\n\noutside\n\nthe other wall\n\nplastered with\n\nadvertising for\n\nholidays\n\ninsurance\n\nanti-fascism\n\nfeminism\n\nways to\n\nsave\n\nthe planet\n\nways to\n\nleave\n\nthe planet.\n\n\n\nIf I close\n\nmy eyes\n\nit's easy\n\nto disappear\n\nin the hail\n\nof sound\n\nand echo\n\nthe feel\n\nof a cool\n\nbreeze\n\nas bikes\n\nand scooters\n\ngo whizzing by\n\ngetting sucked\n\nthrough\n\nthis tube\n\nof rushing\n\nsound.\n\n----------------------------------\n\n\n\nThe accompanying audio files to the book are included here for download.",

      "about": "Jason Kahn // voice, acoustic guitar\n\n\n\nRecorded April 9, 2020 in Zürich at Kunstraum Walcheturm.\n\n\n\nRecording, mixing, mastering, liner notes and LP artwork Jason Kahn.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Patrick Huber for allowing me to record in Kunstraum Walcheturm.\n\n\n\nThese pieces were recorded during one evening on April 9, 2020 in Zürich, my home for the last twenty-one years. I rode my bike through the rainy night to the Kunstraum Walcheturm, a place where I’ve recorded many times before. The city felt abandoned. We were in the midst of the first of several Covid lockdowns. Except for supermarkets and pharmacies, most places were closed. Public transportation was still running but was hardly being used. Nearly empty buses and trams drove by. For once, the streets were practically free of traffic. There was hardly anyone in sight on the Langstrasse, normally a clot of drug dealers, prostitutes, students and tourists roving from bar to bar in a drunken, obliterated haze.\n\n\n\nI could've felt sad at all the loss of life, but somehow I was elated at the strangeness of the situation. I especially noticed how the city sounded now. Every little noise seemed to jump out at me. I rang the bell of my bike. It resonated in the empty streets like a giant church bell. I've lived in large cities all my life, but I'd hardly ever experienced them so quiet as this. Maybe if I was lucky, in those moments before dawn, did a city reach this level of serenity. But this never lasted long, and with the rise of the sun a city's roar returned again. Zürich had been this quiet for weeks now.\n\n\n\nOnce inside the Kunstraum Walcheturm, the sense of solitude deepened. I had this large empty room to myself. Just one chair and a spotlight above. A pair of microphones stood before me. All I had to do was sit down and play. On this evening I felt like I was singing for the city outside. To fill, at least in my mind, that void of the empty streets with my voice and the sounds coming from my guitar. Of course, I had no songs to sing. I was just improvising with the feeling of this desolation and strange sense of peacefulness in the midst of so much tragedy and suffering. I hadn't even been planning on doing this, but I'd coincidentally spoken a few days earlier with Patrick Huber, the Kunstraum Walcheturm's founder, and he mentioned that the room was free. Everything in his schedule had been canceled indefinitely.\n\n\n\nI sat down and started the recorder. After each piece I took a short break to tune the guitar and give my voice a rest. After nearly two hours I'd recorded all the pieces you have here on these two LP's. Nothing has been remixed or edited. I wanted to preserve the continuity and flow of the music from the moment it was created, capturing that brief space in time where my feelings and inspiration congealed into the sounds you have before you now. This record is like a postcard to myself, from a strange time and place that even now as I write this, in the midst of yet another form of lockdown, seems like a frightening dream I once had and not something I actually ever lived through.\n\n\n\nI filed the recordings away and didn't really give them much thought for quite some time. I hadn't been thinking of a release when I went to record these pieces. If anything, this was just a product of chance -- having a space to record in suddenly available to me -- and being in a situation where I sensed the need to document what I was feeling. A kind of field recording of my soul's environment. Only after around six months did I give the recordings a listen again. I was immediately stuck by their sparseness and slow movement. At times, the pieces felt like they were on the verge of disappearing into the empty night outside. Maybe I had been trying to fill this void but was also somehow hesitant to intrude on the sense of quiet, which in itself was like a kind of monument to the situation we were all living through. I teetered above an abyss of emptiness with the need to sing out for all the life we still had left in us, despite the world crawling to a halt around us.\n\n\n\nThe title Days Falling spoke to my feeling of each day falling from above, like a plodding rain, belligerent in its insistence to never completely stop. Each day tumbling down over us, casting a long shadow across our psychic landscapes. The weight just won't let up. We plod on but there seems to be no end in sight, just living for the next day and hoping that that next day will somehow be better, or at least less worse, than the day before. One day falling to the wayside to make space for the next. Like a slow-motion avalanche of time, a morass of days tumbling down across the empty city below. A sense of time lost hangs heavy in the emptiness of the shuttered buildings. Where has everybody gone? Where have the days gone? The resonance of each day comes crashing down, echoes in my mind, fills my dreams. To wake to another day like the one before, windblown streets, an empty aluminum can scraping noisily across the sidewalk, a stray dog barking, sirens in the distance all around us. The only consolation is the birds, singing more loudly than ever, their tiny voices rising above the call of ambulances and cold gusts of wind blasting in from the east. Where the Alps rise up snow-capped and majestic, like a vision we once had of better times, better places. Blue skies and the dazzling sunlight refracting off the banks of snow like a vast field of diamonds.\n\n\n\nWhen thinking of titles for these recordings, memories of Sam Shepard, one of my favorite writers and personalities, came to mind. He died more than a few years back, but I'd recently been rereading some of his short stories and poems. The existential depth of his work seemed fitting for what I was feeling when I made these recordings, thinking about what was unseen, unspoken, maybe never experienced outside of dreams or nightmares. The cumulative effect sometimes being we never know what is right before our eyes. Is it a dream or a waking reality? With so much death and sickness around us, I was of course worried about my kids. I'd already lost my daughter Louise, who died in her sleep when she was just a few months old. This is The Buried Child in this recording. The title taken from Shepard's play of the same name. Something not secret to us but maybe we wish it were. A yawning fear that never leaves us. I felt this so often in the time of these recordings, worried about another child to bury.\n\n\n\nLikewise, The Unseen Hand takes its title from another one of Shepard's plays. Here, the title spoke to me more than the content of the play itself, which is something closer to science fiction than anything else. Still, I often ask myself what is the unseen hand which guides us. What pushes us along when we no longer have the strength to move forward? The unseen hand which wakes us from our sleep, cradles us in its palm, slaps us around when we're being stupid or embarrassing ourselves but don't know it. As Diego Maradona so succinctly put it, it is the hand of God. This is the hand which scored the goal, the unseen hand swatting us from here to there. The hand we clasp when it's time to go, pulling us to the other side. The title Across the Night chronicles just what I was thinking on the night of these recordings. Wondering what lies across the night, what all my friends are doing, how they are coping. What a misery as this world turns from night into morning and back to night again. All I could see when I closed my eyes to go to sleep that night after making these recordings were the stars burning down across the black nighttime skies. I was thinking of all the different times and places I looked up at these stars, perhaps asking the same questions about what lay in store for us across the night. The stars map this journey for us, a journey, as Ferdinand Céline so beautifully described it, to the end of the night.\n\n\n\nFar in Mind would be that place I go to when I can't escape these thoughts, this cold fear of uncertainty and life slowly grinding down to a halt, like a new ice age. Those huge glaciers slowly grinding their way through my soul, deep fissure carved, the scars of so many days left behind. Better forgotten, though hard as we try, these days cling to us like a bitter rain. Far in mind lies beyond the horizon, across the galaxies, in places we've only imagined or dreamed of. Places where we belong and would like to return to one day. A meditation on these places far in mind but yet right there before us, alive and true and beckoning us on. A shelter from the storm of sirens and empty streets. How often have I traveled far in mind only to find myself in the blink of an eye right back here again. An oscillation between all these spaces in my mind, dark caverns and blinding beams of light. Far in mind is where I would be if I could be.\n\n\n\nThe title of the last piece To See That Heaven was taken from the lyrics to Stevie Wonder's song Golden Lady. And actually, the entire verse is to see that heaven in your eyes is not so far, which could be considered as one of my personal mantras. Because what is it we see when we look into the eyes of the one we love? It is that heaven which is always there but which we only notice in love. In these hard times how easy it is to forget that heaven, to not see those eyes. Standing before a mirror we look into our own eyes. We see only fear, uncertainty, sadness. Our aura burns brightly around us but we see only darkness. Heaven might as well be a million light years away if we can't see it, if our eyes are blind to it. Each day I try to see that heaven, though it often eludes me. But there is still the notion that it exists, that I'm part of it. That it's waiting there for me to come back and open my eyes to what has never left. To see that heaven.\n\n\n\nThese days the streets are alive again. Sunlight fills the air. People are out and about in the parks and at the lake. The stores are busy, restaurants full. It's even hard to find a seat in the bus again. The time before seems like a collective dream we once had. A dream which still casts a long shadow across my soul. Now it's been more than a year since I recorded these pieces. I find this period hard to go back to. It was a dark place but somehow there was a light, and I think at the time that through this music I was able to find my own north star, guiding me out of the darkness.",

      "about": "Spirits marks the second release of my duo with Christian Wolfarth, though in 2010 recordings of a trio with Christian, Günter Müller and myself (then on electronics) came out as the CD “Limmat” on the Mikroton Recordings label in Moscow. Following this trio CD, Christian and I didn’t play together again until 2016, when we had a series of concerts in Switzerland and a recording session that yielded the Confront Recordings CD “Percussion / Voice.” On occasion of this CD, we toured the UK in the fall of 2017. \n\n\n\nAt a concert in September 2018, Christian heard me playing slide resonator guitar with a quartet at the Werkstatt für improvisierte Musik Zürich. He suggested I add the guitar to our duo. To be honest, at first I wasn’t sure if this would be a good idea. Up to this point, I’d mainly played the guitar as a soloist. I had no idea of how I could integrate this in Christian’s playing. But we tried it out and embarked on a series of concerts across Europe in the fall of 2019.\n\n\n\nUp until to the first gig of this tour, I’d been playing the resonator guitar in “Spanish” fashion, tuned down to C in Vestapol. This gig went well, but something bothered me about my playing. I’m a huge fan of the blues and playing in Vestapol tuning automatically puts one in a blues tonality. But playing with Christian in the context of non-idiomatic improvisation the idea of bringing in the idiom of the blues, albeit in its most abstract form, just didn’t seem to work for me. I could see how this would distract from the nature of what we were doing. Moving back to standard tuning (in C) put me in more neutral territory, far away from any idiomatic playing. \n\n\n\nI also switched to playing lap style, which prior to these concerts I’d not really tried. Playing in this manner also allowed me to approach the guitar from more of a percussionist’s standpoint, something second nature for me as the drum set was my first instrument (actually, the guitar was my first instrument but I didn’t really pursue this as I did the drums). And finally, laying the guitar flat opened me up to the playing space and the audience. This is important to me because I like to feel vulnerable when vocalizing, to sense the danger of the situation and not be able to hide behind an instrument. \n\n\n\nChristian also refined his playing concept, taking only an antique marching snare, one Chinese cymbal and some small objects on tour. The terms “reduction” or “minimal” have often been applied to Christian’s approach. I’ve always found such labels misleading. To me, Christian’s practice would be more accurately described as “maximalist.” Getting the most out of one instrument. Maximizing the sounds possible from one cymbal, the rim of a snare drum. At this point, I think if Christian were to only clap his hands he could come up with an infinite number of ways to apply this in a musical context.\n\n\n\nThe idea for 2019 was to do a tour and then follow this up with recordings for a new LP. To these ends, we played twelve shows in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Switzerland. We performed in art spaces, galleries, artists’ studios, bars, apartments, clubs, the cellar of a translation agency and a disused factory. Two months after our last date we met to record in Zürich at the Kunstraum Walcheturm, the city’s preeminent space for experimental arts practices.\n\n\n\nWe’d definitely cooled off from the tour by this point. I’d have preferred to have met sooner, but scheduling didn’t permit this. I set up my mobile studio in Walcheturm’s spacious and resonant main room. Christian arrived with his instruments. We did a brief sound check then recorded four pieces, one after the other with just short breaks in-between. Take number one became A-Side of this record. Take number three is the B-Side. \n\n\n\nWhat you hear on this LP is what we played during the recording session. The recordings were made to multi-track, with stereo microphones in front of Christian’s instruments, a vocal microphone and a guitar microphone for myself, and two pairs of stereo room microphones at various distances in front of us. We set up next to each other, as we did for all our concerts. I mixed the recordings but didn’t do any editing in the sense of cutting things up and moving different parts around. The flow and sequence of events is intact on these recordings. Mixing only entailed finding a good equilibrium between our instruments and bringing the presence of the room into the overall sound.\n\n\n\nI suggested the title of “Spirits,” though at the time I couldn’t say why this title would be appropriate for our music. It seems now, having to write these liner notes and forcing myself to give this some more thought, that the idea of spirits permeates the nature of this music. Which after each performance often felt to me like an incantation, a call to all those spirits of this music that came before us. When I perform, I feel a spiritual kinship to all the musicians who’ve inspired me and helped me find my own sound through listening to their playing.\n\n\n\nThere is also the spirit of the moment, lost in a timelessness that for me only improvising seems to induce. How can we capture the essence of a space in time and allow ourselves to be swept up in a continuum of spontaneous music, feeling the presence of the audience, distilling all that we’ve experienced into this one moment? If this sounds dramatic, then I guess that’s because it is. As Val Wilmer once so famously and accurately noted in her classic book of the same title, improvisation is “as serious as your life.” There’s no hiding in this moment, no room for artifice or craft. There’s only listening, “feeling” the place and time. The spirit of eternity in sound.",

      "about": "Jason Kahn\n\n\"Voice and Sky\"\n\n(2018)\n\n\n\nEditions 007\n\nbook+cd\n\n\n\n15x14 cm\n\n74 pages\n\nCD, Duration 67.36\n\nISBN 978-3-033-06656-4\n\n\n\nVoice and Sky provides both a look at a previous work, On the Breeze – a series of public space interventions and text / sound installation – and an extension of that work in the form of a book and CD publication. My view is that an installation or any kind of work dealing with the idea of space – be it a public space or a designated art space – can only be fully experienced by being in that space first hand. In the case of On the Breeze, using material gathered hiking extensively through the Swiss canton of Appenzell Innerrhoden, the final installation could only really be understood or felt within the context of the place the exhibition was held. The installation’s use of the recordings made during the interventions and the text I wrote during my hikes through the mountains were directly intertwined with the environment one walked through to get to the exhibition, which was scattered throughout the Swiss countryside of Appenzell Ausserrhoden near the small town of Gais. The idea of reconstructing On the Breeze in book and CD form would be impossible. The point of publishing this book, then, isn’t about creating a documentation but quite simply to share my experience working on the public space interventions and the ensuing installation. It is my feeling that the text and recordings on the CD impart something universal and untethered from the context of the original installation. The primary material of On the Breeze was in fact not these texts or recordings but the very space itself and my experience there, inserting myself through voice, movement and text. Voice and Sky chronicles this process.",

      "about": "Jason Kahn // Circle\n\n\n\nEditions 008\n\n\n\nJason Kahn // voice, resonator guitar \n\n\n\nRecorded June 12, 2018 in Kunstraum Walcheturm, Zürich. \n\nMixed and mastered July 25 - August 25, 2018. \n\n\n\nCover photo taken from a video made in concert on May 24, 2018 by Jim Strong at Vox Populi Gallery in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nThanks to Patrick Huber for letting me spend an evening in Walcheturm to record. \n\n\n\n\n\nThese recordings were made shortly after returning home from a 15-show tour across the U.S. and Canada, though I’d been working on this material for some time prior to the tour. Although the pieces on this release are all improvised, the ideas therein were realized more fully over the course of the tour. I find that improvising can only really develop with an audience, and being able to test this material in front of a different crowd of people practically every night for over two weeks pushed my ideas to another level of expression.\n\n\n\nGuitar was actually my first instrument, a few years prior to beginning music in earnest on drum set. Returning to the guitar after all these years is in a sense coming full circle for me over my musical lifetime of forty years. The title of the release hints at this journey but also at the structure of the pieces, which circle around themselves, weaving around a central idea and sonic material.\n\n\n\nThese pieces were recorded by myself over the course of an evening, alone in a large, resonant room in Zürich. I approached the recording session as if I were playing a concert before an audience. I started a piece and saw it through to its end. By the end of the evening, I had made many more recordings than on the final release here. The last piece on the release was in fact the last piece of the evening. I tuned down the guitar another couple of steps and listened for the night.\n\n\n\nI imagine that many people who’ve followed my work over the years might be puzzled by the directions I’ve taken – from drum set, electronics, environmental recording, graphical scores, installations with text and sound, solo extended voice and now guitar. For me, there is a continuity to what I’m doing and each new development leads me on to the next, as contrary as it might seem to what has come before. And this is also to say that what has come before hasn’t been abandoned. Like the pieces on this release I feel myself circling around recurring ideas and approaches, with each orbit picking up new material and concepts along the way. For me there is no destination, just points along the way.\n\n\n\nJason Kahn\n\nZürich, 2018 \n\n\n\njasonkahn.net/editions\n\n\n\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nReviews:\n\n\n\nIn keeping with the interest in vocal improvisation expressed in recent years – initially concretized on 2015’s Songline – Jason Kahn armed himself with a resonator guitar and recorded a good amount of solo pieces inside Zurich’s Kunstraum Walcheturm, a venue known for its resonant qualities. No spectators were present, but Kahn was focusing on the emotional core of the matter exactly as he would in concert.\n\nAlthough convinced that “improvisation can only develop with an audience” (for the record, this writer thinks the opposite is true), Kahn managed to strike an uncommon balance between refined forms and uttered viscerality. The approach on the instrument – reportedly the first he ever played, well before the electronic/percussive ventures that made him renowned – is that of a modern bluesman: the fingers’ savvy on the strings is clearly felt, both in the stronger passages and when a higher degree of understatedness is involved.\n\n\n\nThe voice finds attractive parallelisms with the guitar in the sliding interstices that link the tonal centres (hypothetical or real), enhancing our participation with a compound of unrepressed primordial energies and tense insightfulness. Kahn does look for guide lights and sweeter spots as we all do during adversity; however, to achieve the aim he shows no fear whatsoever in treading seriously uncomfortable paths. Occasionally, he appears to suffer excruciatingly while singing; in other tracks, the imageries evoked project out-and-out wordless rituals. In any circumstance, not a single minute is deprived of conspicuous events.\n\n\n\nUltimately, time is needed to sponge up what Kahn tried to transfer; the hours spent within this album are going to be repaid in full. As he writes in the introductory notes, “for me there is no destination, just points along the way”. We’re happy to trek in the company of a seeker who’s never afraid of disclosing his nakedness.\n\n>Massimo Ricci, Touching Extremes, 11.2018\n\n\n\n\n\nVoice and resonator guitar from the prolific US-born Zürich-dweller. But if you’re expecting something like Charlie Parr, you should probably look away now. Neither is this project bathed in sepia-toned cod-“authenticity”, thankfully. For those not familiar with Kahn’s activities over the last twenty years or so, his recorded output has most often been concerned with field recordings and associated recording techniques. He began his music career as a drummer, spent many years practicing improvisation and making field recordings while simultaneously developing his art practice, but more recently has toured using analogue synthesiser, or voice. (STOP PRESS! I’ve just seen a short film on social media promoting Jason’s current duo with guitarist Beat Keller wherein Jason is perched behind a drum kit! You heard it here first!) I attended a recent duo performance with Jason in vocal-only mode in collaboration with master percussionist Christian Wolfarth last year which was absolutely breathtaking, if you’ll excuse the pun.\n\n\n\n“Circle_1” is cranking away nicely until at 7 and a half minutes, Kahn’s voice begins to sound like static. It’s unique, I think, in the field of vocal improvisors; at least I’ve not heard anything quite like it before. It’s my favourite sound Kahn makes, I think. On “Circle_2”, his vocal shifts pitch and key; exploring microtones. Quieter, beautiful. For me, the beginning of “Circle_3” creates a desolate atmosphere not unlike Nico’s Desertshore. In mood - not sound or instrumentation, but mood. This may or may not intend to denote a similar kind of disconnection or disunity with ones surrounding or situation.\n\n\n\nOn “Circle_4”, “Circle_5” and “Circle_6” I particularly noticed that Kahn plays his Resonator guitar with a slide. Probably these pieces are the nearest to a “traditional” approach; or at least, the tradition can be heard in Kahn’s playing. A sharecropper’s blues lament abstracted through the 21st century mind-set prism. You could almost say it could be an emotional tribute to musicians like Tampa Red and Son House. “Circle_6” is actually the last piece of recording from this session at Zürich’s Kunstraum Walcheturm arts space. Kahn utilises the natural reverb of the hall with his skilful microphone placement really nicely.\n\n\n\nKahn talks about Circle in this way: “…Guitar was actually my first instrument, a few years prior to beginning music in earnest on drum set. Returning to the guitar after all these years is in a sense coming full circle for me over my musical lifetime of forty years.”\n\n\n\nAll six tracks have a duration of between nine and ten minutes, so at nearly an hour of material, there’s plenty to get immersed in. Kahn is as rigorously experimental, perhaps searching is a better word, as is usual on Circles so it’s best to get comfortable and treat this album as an intimate concert in your own front room. I would have liked to set this album in some kind of context and mention certain other experimental musicians known for utilizing Resonator guitar. But outside of Sherry Ostapovich, whose superb album The Red Thumb was released under the name Musicforone back in 2008, there aren’t many other avant-resonatorists, at least that I’m aware of. BJ Cole has used one, I’m led to believe, when he isn’t playing pedal steel. So, it seems here, Jason Kahn is currently working in a very small field. Not a bad place to be. As with all of Kahn’s endeavours, this one rewards careful listening.\n\n>Paul Kimasia Morgan, Honest Music For Dishonest Times, 10.201\n\n\n\n\n\nKahn previously released an album with the same title (Celadon, 2009). Not only is this quite different from that one, it's (as near a I can determine), very different from anything else he's put out. I should qualify that as Kahn has issued a large amount of material and, though I've heard a great deal of it over the years, I'm not a completist but we'll just say that, on the surface, we're a long way from the rotating metals, etc. from the past. Here it's just guitar and voice and, on first blush, a slightly more subdued Keiji Haino comes to mind. The guitar work is a kind of abstracted blues form (it was Kahn's first instrument), played in very much his own style though perhaps guitarists from Fahey to Tetuzi Akiyama might drift into the listener's mind, while the voice ranges from strangulated cries, to soft moans to evocations of Robbie Basho. Whether the works, reasonably similar, quite justify the hour of the disc is open to question, but I largely enjoyed it and appreciate Kahn's willingness to venture out on this particular limb. Curious to see how long-time listeners deal with it.\n\n>Brian Olewnick, Just Outside, 9.2018",

      "about": "The title \"Beautiful Ghost Wave\" occurred to me as I was composing the piece from different recordings I'd made in my studio during 2010. In order to keep track of all the working material I gave the different sound files names, and in this case \"beautiful ghost wave\" was one of them. This particular file struck me for the beauty of the peripheral sounds occurring, a kind of sonic aura hovering around the more central sounds in the recording. Thinking about this more I began to see this title as a model for the entire piece, where the partials of a sound, something analogous to \"hearing between the sounds\" (as in \"reading between the lines\") became the focus for my compositional choices. \n\n\n\nBeyond all this \"Beautiful Ghost Wave\" is a bit of a departure for me in that it deals more with dramaturgy than other work of mine. I wanted to extend a sense of movement to the sounds and create a feeling of the piece expanding and contracting, both through dynamic modulation and an emphasis placed on spatiality in the stereo field. Although the piece retains a sense of forward movement and an allusion towards an impending resolution, I wanted the feeling for the listener to be of an open system, where the actual ending or further continuation of the piece beyond its actual cessation on the CD could be filled in, much as one fills in meaning when reading between the lines of a text.\n\n\n\nI recorded the basic material using analog synthesizer, mixing board, contact microphones, short wave radio and electromagnetic coils. The recording was made with microphones placed in front of the loudspeakers and in the room directly behind where I was sitting, thus lending a sense of acoustics to the sounds I generated and recording my movement as I made these sounds. These recordings were then edited and used to compose with on the computer. \n\n\n\nJason Kahn \n\nZürich \n\nDecember\n\n2010",

      "about": "Since 2011 I've been developing a series of works entitled \"In Place,\" in which I address the process of what transpires when I go to a place to make a recording. Of course, I come away with a recording of something. I've made my catch of material or perhaps a stand-alone composition or panoramic still life. But more than this I take back with me the experience of spending time in a place, absorbing that place in all its details: its sights, its sounds, how on emotional and intellectual\n\nlevels I interacted with this place. When I'm back home listening to the recordings a rush of memories accompanies them, much like Proust's famous biscuit in his cup of tea unleashing a torrent of recollections from his childhood. My mind wanders beyond the recordings and their subtleties. I begin to think about the place, how I felt being there, what that place was about in terms of its social context, its function; how people reacted to me being there, to what my mind was thinking while I was making the recordings -- all this mental and emotional material existing alongside the snazzy sound files I'd managed to make\n\nwith all my shiny equipment.\n\n\n\nSo I decided, why not just write a text about this process, about my time spent in a place making a recording? And the text itself would be the actual recording, with my reading the text a presentation of the place. My words and the emotions they convey...will this reveal more about the place I've spent time in than an actual sound recording? Or just something different?\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean to spend time in a place and just being there? Not \"doing\" anything there. Not making a recording. Not\n\ntaking notes. Not making photos or doing anything at all but just being there?\n\n\n\n\"In Place\" is also to a large extent influenced by my reading of the works of Henri Lefebrve, in particular his two books \"The Production of Space\" and \"Rhythmanalysis.\" Lefebvre dissects the issue of space, what constitutes a space, how we can create a space, what the social elements are of a space and how we interact with a space on these different planes.\n\n\n\nThe daily rhythms of life, the dynamics of time passing and spaces changing over time, both on the grand historical scale from erection to ruin, as well as on the daily level all shape how space is formed and experienced. And these are precisely the issues I want to explore in spending time in different spaces, investigating them, experiencing them and then reflecting about them. \"In Place\" exposes what remains at the juncture between the space's physical presence and the presence of my voice, embodying my experience of that space on all its planes.\n\n\n\nOn October 1, 2012 I spent twelve hours (5 AM to 5 PM) in the Daitoku-ji temple complex in Kyoto. More specifically, I was sitting in front of the main Hon-do and by the Sentai-Jizo. The Daitoku-ji temple complex is actually a large grouping of twenty-four sub-temples. Though not all of the sub-temples are open on a daily basis, and those that are only from the morning till the early evening, the main temple grounds are always open to the public. Many people from the surrounding neighborhood pass through the temple grounds each day, walking their dogs, jogging, coming to prey or just to take a relaxing detour away from the city outside. And, of course, many tourists also come but not in the droves which afflict many of\n\nKyoto's more famous temples and shrines. I was living nearby the temple and passed though the main grounds nearly every\n\nday. I couldn't think of a better place in Kyoto to spend a long day.\n\n\n\nOn October 11 I spent ten hours (6 AM to 4 PM) at the Shibuya Crossing in Shibuya, Tokyo, shifting my position throughout the\n\nday to each of the four corners which delineate the crossing. This intersection is home to some of the most dense\n\naccumulations of people in Tokyo, with wave upon human wave emptying from Shibuya Station and disappearing into the office\n\ntowers and businesses of the Shibuya district beyond. Large video screens mounted on buildings at three points of the crossing\n\ndrench the area in sound and light. The air is incredibly polluted from the constant traffic. One corner of the crossing is a\n\nfavorite place for political demonstrations, which pretty much go on through the whole day. From my many visits to Tokyo I\n\nwas familiar with Shibuya Crossing. It seemed to epitomize for me some of the best and worst elements in Tokyo. I wanted to\n\nspend a day getting past the glare and noise of Shibuya by planting myself at its epicenter.\n\n\n\nI chose these two locations to juxtapose what I felt were the most extreme ends of modern Japan's cultural spectrum. And I wanted see what it would be like to experience first hand these two very different yet, in some ways, very similar spaces by spending a day in each. I would be lying if I claimed to have gotten to the heart of these two places by spending some hours there, but I do feel that I scratched the surface and moved beyond my earlier impressions. I only hope that through the sound of my voice reading the texts which I've written about these places, that the listener will also come away with some essence of Daitoku-ji Temple and Shibuya Crossing. \n\n\n\nOriginally released in 2013 as winds measure wm33 cassette",

      "about": "Composed 2007-2008\n\n\n\n\"Vanishing Point\" is dedicated to my daugter Louise, who died in 2007.\n\n\n\nAt first I thought of the title in reference to Louise's passing, that point where she vanished from our lives, but on further reflection I came to see the compostion as dealing with other vanishing points. I address the idea of one's sense of time vanishing, being immersed in sound and entering a place of timelessness. There is also the idea of boundaries between electronic and acoustic sound vanishing, as in this piece I draw on both sources. And finally, in the sense of aural perspective extending to the point where we imagine it ending, as the compostion stretches on towards its vista, slowly vanishing.\n\n\n\nOriginally released as 23five CD 23five 015",

      "about": "These two pieces were recorded in the\n\nKustraum Walcheturm here in Zürich.\n\nThis is an art space run by a friend of\n\nmine. The main room where I made\n\nthese recordings is pretty large\n\nand very resonant.\n\n\n\nI made these two pieces with mixing\n\nboard, contact microphone, radio and\n\nelectro magnetic conductor. I recorded\n\nthe piece with one set of stereo\n\nmicrophones placed further back in\n\nthe room, one microphone in front of the\n\nspeaker and one line recording, thus\n\ngiving me the immediacy of a direct\n\nrecording with the resonance of the\n\nspace, which is what I was mainly\n\ninterested in exploring with these\n\ntwo pieces.\n\n\n\nRecorded April 21, 2011.\n\n\n\nThanks to Patrick Huber for letting me\n\nuse the Kunstraum Walcheturm to make\n\nthis recording.\n\n\n\nOriginally release as Banned Production cassette bp182",
