      "about": "originally released as cd on Tripticks Tapes (USA) \n\ntriptickstapes.bandcamp.com/album/sculptor\n\n\n\n Sculptor is the second release of a duo of Ilia Belorukov (Saint Petersburg, Russia) and Gabriel Ferrandini (Lisbon, Portugal) after their debut studio album Disquiet on Clean Feed in 2019. In May of that year Gabriel came to Russia to play release gigs with Ilia and they captured those concerts. Sculptor was recorded in a very special place in Petersburg. It was a workspace of architect Mikhail Anikushin from 1969 to 1997 which was builded specially for him. Place is huge, including a 15 meters height ceiling and very big windows. Because of that it has special sound acoustics, where even small sounds can be audible very clearly. Ilia and Gabriel explored this phenomena with alto saxophone and drums, and continued to add new edges to sax/drums duos in improvised music.",

      "about": "self-released on bandcamp \n\n\n\nliner notes about album (pdf included with download):\n\n\n\nVolume 13 of the work-in-the-progress series continues to showcase my modular synthesizer explorations. Over time, I have been trying to figure out where the focus has shifted in my relationship with electronics. In 2021-2024 I realized I was much less interested in the idea of integrating field recordings into electronic music. Is the theme of playing with rooms and their acoustics still there? Yes, that’s for sure. Here the main interest was the synthesis itself, cross-feedbacks and unexpected (but controlled) modulations.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, I played three solo concerts in St. Petersburg. Two took place in the spring, and one happened in December. The last one was released on the Karta Skvazhin label, it was a performance in their concert series. A fragment of the concert in April 2021 was released on the compilation of the Italian label DDDD. A fragment from the third concert is here on this compilation. Field recordings and samples still had their place, and now I find the rhythmic pattern in the last part of the piece quite interesting. Andrey Popovskiy drew my setup from that evening.\n\n \n\nLinks to other tracks from 2021: \n\niliabelorukov.bandcamp.com/album/split-with-feliks-mirenskiy \n\n  iliabelorukov.bandcamp.com/track/saint-petersburg-2021-04-03-live-fragment\n\n\n\n The following year passed without any solo concerts with a synthesizer. However, in September 2022, in Biel/Bienne, Switzerland, in the studio of the Strøm duo, I rehearsed with a modular synthesizer and one evening recorded a noise-feedback piece during a hard rain. Probably this environmental sound inspired more rigid and direct forms of music-making. Playing with the rain and mimicking it with white noise, the process itself was more important to me than the result. However, this is not raw documentation as I later shortened and slightly edited the recording.\n\n\n\nIn 2023 I visited the legendary echoraum and tried a new setup without a laptop, but with a Line 6 HX Stomp processor. It served as a mixer and final sound shaper, and was controlled using TouchOSC on an iPhone. This combination turned out to be interesting and I began to use this setup on a regular basis. This set I played in Vienna was quite chaotic and caustic. Apparently the absence of concerts with a synthesizer for more than a year and a half had an effect and therefore I wanted to play more of everything.\n\nVideo excerpt from that concert:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfdw80ykiB0\n\n\n\n In April 2024 I found myself in Wade Matthews' cozy studio in Madrid after a tour with Gaudenz Badrutt. I had the opportunity to rehearse solo and recorded several etudes, two of which I decided to include in the compilation. These tracks have almost no influence of room acoustics. The focus switched to various noise textures of the patch, where the key sound source was the digital complex oscillator Intellijel Shapeshifter. I had a hard time with this module, and for about a year I only occasionally touched it, intimidated by the various menus and plenty of functions. But suddenly it took an almost central role in my system. For example, this module is the main one on the track from Novi Sad. That evening I played after the screening of a documentary about Papa Srapa, although the selected piece can hardly be compared with the legendary noise musician. Unlike the Madrid stuff, at this concert Shapeshifter is not a noise generator, but a kind of pseudo-random oscillator. It seems that the current research process is going in this direction.\n\n\n\nThanks to Wade Matthews, Gaudenz Badrutt, Sara Zlanabitnig, Alisa Beck, Daniel Lercher, Alexander Markvart and Lauri Hyvärinen.\n\n\n\nIlia Belorukov, November 2024",

      "about": "originally released as digital on scatter records (UK) \n\nscatterarchive.bandcamp.com/album/fireflies\n\n\n\n Grasping what is happening in a concert of freely improvised music requires multifocal listening. Specifically, it requires an awareness of how the individual improvisers are interacting, what each is contributing to the overall music, and how that overall music actually sounds as a clearly synergetic event.\n\n\n\nOf course, when the musicians are playing electroacoustic devices, it can be quite difficult to determine who is playing what. Such devices are enormously varied, but very few of them call for the sort of expansive gestures required to play much more familiar acoustic instruments such as the drums or a cello, which any real musical listener can easily tell apart. Far fewer listeners will be able to draw the same distinctions between, say, a digital synthesizer, an analogue modular setup, or a laptop-controlled combination of digital synthesis and concrète-style manipulation of samples. Seeing these instruments on stage often fails to clarify matters, as the clearly visible gestures of a drummer or a cellist are almost entirely absent at a purely electroacoustic concert. And, of course, if one is not at the concert, and can only listen to a recording, it can very quickly become impossible to determine whether a series of sounds is a phrase being played by one musician or a rapid interaction among two or more. In such a case, how are we to grasp the interaction that makes freely improved music so dynamic and often so interesting? The answer lies in learning to grasp how the sounds themselves interact, which can only be learned by listening to music that really works, music in which the sounds actually do interact in meaningful ways. In other words, music that initially offers us more than we can grasp on just one hearing, yet offers us enough, on that initial hearing, to convince us that there is, in fact, more to be heard. Music that invites us to listen again, and again.\n\n\n\nThe present recording is of a first encounter. Ilia Belorukov and Gaudenz Badrutt have been playing together as a duo for some time. Musically, they know each other well. Neither, however, had previously played with Wade Matthews, so there was much to be discovered, and that, I believe, adds a certain freshness to the music they made together. Of course this is not an infallible formula. The mere fact of its being the first time could just as easily have produced a mild disaster, a mere hodgepodge of sounds that go nowhere. Happily, this encounter in CRUCE, Madrid’s premier space for improvised music, was truly fecund—so much so, in fact, that all three of us are pleased to share it with any and all interested listeners.\n\n\n\nWade Matthews",

This was not just a direct musical collaboration. Ilia and Sara integrated their sounds into the spaces in which they were played in, be it the  studio_kuda.org,  the museum acoustics or the Peace Chapel. The musicians developed different approaches through a common language of free improvised music in real time. But 'Binus' was not yet complete. After the recording sessions, they selected material to work with and created five multi-layered, multi-dimensional pieces. They went from a dry space and acoustics to a much larger space with many reflections. They used multiple instrumental tracks mixed with various field recordings. They made a transition from the electronic sound of a live concert to the form of an acoustic duo. So the music on the CD is not only the documentation of this short residency of the duo but also the result of a post-production process that will lead the artists to new ideas for the future.\n\n\n\nThe content of this release was created within the framework of the NOISM program, produced by  kuda.org,  which was supported by the Austrian Cultural Forum Belgrade.",

      "about": "self-released on bandcamp\n\n\n\nThis new chapter in the work-in-progress solo series was played on wind instruments and was captured in 2018-2022. In recent years I've concentrated on modular synthesizer and electronics a bit more, but the saxophone is still the most familiar instrument for me and I still try to find new ways to play it. \n\n\n\nFirst tracks recorded on Soprano Venova, a plastic instrument invented by Yamaha. I always wanted to have a portable instrument and was very interested in a new «toy», but after some time I decided to sell it because of lack of time to work with the soprano sax mouthpiece that this instrument needs. I did a few recordings with it, here are two tracks from home and one from the same forest that you can hear on \"A Fluteophone in the Forest'' album, which was recorded a year after.\n\n\n\nNext two tracks are recorded on alto saxophone in the rotunda of Mayakovsky library in different concerts in 2019. It is a very special place for musicians in Saint Petersburg because of its huge acoustics, and used to be a Dutch church in the past. It is not an easy place to play, and that year I had 3 tries to find a way to play solo sax there.\n\n \n\nThe track from Oslo is significant for me. It is was my last gig abroad before the pandemic started, and I had great pleasure to play a long solo set in a very calm and quiet place. I had many plans for the future in mind, it is so unusual to remember that situation now. The gig was around 55 minutes in total. It was almost impossible to cut something from the whole storytelling, but this short excerpt sounds like a complete story.\n\n\n\nThe next track was recorded at a small farm near Petersburg in a big wooden house with a warm acoustic space. At that moment I had started to explore a plastic reed more closely, and that was the first gig that was played only on it. \n\n\n\nNature was again around me in the Swiss Alps, with cows and their bells. Small wooden house. This was the beginning of my first trip abroad after all that has happened since 2020. I had no idea I wouldn’t be going back home after a 3 weeks residency in Switzerland. \n\n\n\nThe last piece is a complete short set in Biel/Bienne, it was also the first gig outside Petersburg since February 2020. More to say, it was my first gig after January 2022, for me it was not easy to find a reason to play in Petersburg in the new reality which came that February... Here I used a timer and sound signals as some marks for this solo that I played on a tribune of a small football field surrounded by watch factories. Big acoustics and environmental sounds, and the questions of reacting or not reacting to them. The timer is counting, while the mind is walking around.\n\n\n\nIlia Belorukov, May 2023",

      "about": "originally released as digital on scatter records (UK) \n\nscatterarchive.bandcamp.com/album/autiofiktio\n\n\n\n Pug Life began as the experimental improvisatory duo of Lauri Hyvärinen (electric guitar) and Taneli Viitahuhta (saxophone). They worked on their debut album during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. The music was recorded according to the procedures of social distancing; the musicians playing in different studios and recording their tracks separately. The ensuing \"L’Année Perrotique\" was released on CD by Juho Toivonen’s Akti Records in March 2021. The album turned out to be an attempt to merge improvisation and compositional elements, to map out various kinds of soundscapes that just two players can achieve. \n\n\n\nHaving mixed and mastered that first record, Ilia Belorukov was invited to contribute musically to Pug Life. The three continued to record during 2021, when restrictions on social gatherings were still off and on. Ilia’s presence brought a geographical and textural permutation to the Pug Life equation, as Lauri and Taneli, both Helsinki-based musicians, started to work with Ilia, from St. Petersburg, providing electronic tracks to their electric and acoustic sounds. \n\n\n\nThey soon discovered that Pug Life had entered another new level of dialectics. One of their original goals had been to find immediacy in improvisation by erecting barriers, both sonic and conceptual. Now the liberation from notation turned out to be a way to defend one’s organic way of balancing sounds against composition, while composition acted as a creative way of imposing new restrictions on musical freedom, often rooted in habituality. \n\n\n\nThe title \"Autiofiktio\" includes a pun: 'Auto' is of course derived from the Greek word meaning 'self', and 'autofiktio' is Finnish for 'autofiction'. Literary terms such as autofiction can be employed in musical environments for metaphoric purposes. For example, maybe compositional improvisation could be considered a way of mapping one's own resources and reflecting on how they came about, not dissimilar to autofiction, which blends autobiography (telling it \"how it was\") and narrative structure (fiction) without giving away the rules and architectural measures followed by the author. \"Autiofiktio\" adds to this idea one crucial letter, 'i'. The word 'autio' is an archaic Germanic remnant of Finnish language, meaning something that is desolate, forsaken, forlorn or uninhabited. \n\n\n\nIn a sense then, if Pug Life is a form of fiction (and why not), the band’s efforts with \"Autiofiktio\" mark the birth of a musical genre where fiction is accepted as part of our musical imagination. However, Pug Life tries to work against given ideas of narrative, plotline, tension and release. If Pug Life tracks are in a sense stuck in a rut, they don’t lack resources or creativity. Their music is imagination in a pure state - derelict fiction.",

Kirill proposed to place the \"June ’21\" score on the table, to follow the impression, the feeling, the direction of what it suggests to play. Sometimes we noticed how one part of the score or another would lead us to new ideas whilst we were playing. \n\n\n\nIt was a special concert because of its circumstances. We decided to have one big table for both our setups, and to be standing up during the performance. Kirill used some objects, electronics and field recordings. Besides zither, Ilia played on a tamborim and music box, instruments he hadn’t yet used before. It was important for them to perform with these fresh and exciting materials. \n\n\n\nThe surrounding environment was very different from the sterile and almost claustrophobic one at the earlier concert in June 2021. At the beginning people were still chatting, and when they stopped we began to hear the sounds from the street outside. Luckily, our recorder managed to capture this atmosphere perfectly. And, while it's not necessarily a high quality recording, it has its own character that effectively translates the music we played that night. \n\n\n\nText by Ilia and Kirill, edited by Sasha Elina",

The main task is to explore what various frequencies sound like, within the simple 1-step pattern, at different tempo rates. All pieces were created using Nord Drum 2 with iPad’s MIDI sequencer, the latter of which was used only to manually change the tempo. \n\n\n\nThe title of each piece contains some information: how many tracks were used (where the number corresponds to the track in the synthesizer; I never used all six available tracks, for example), how the tempo was changing, and the first numbers are only for myself – it’s the number of the preset. The recorded sources were slightly processed with some EQ and reverb, otherwise there were no edits or manipulations of time.",

Voice and electronics seem to conspire and mimic each other as if navigating a common terrain.",

      "about": "originally released as tape on Raw Tonk Records (UK) \n\nrawtonkrecords.bandcamp.com/album/a-fluteophone-in-the-forest\n\n\n\n \"A Fluteophone In The Forest\" was recorded in the forest near my grandmother's family's house in the village called Tarasovskaya. It's located in Vologodskaya Oblast (regions around Vologda city), there's no phone or internet connection. Sometimes you can catch a mobile network to read messages or texts of emails and try to make a call. Now there's around 15 houses, only a few people are living there in the winter time. It's a very silent and calm place. I spent almost every summer there in my childhood with my sister. In my adult years I wasn't there so often and had no intentions to break the natural environment with my playing. But somehow it happened and I started to play a bit there in 2018 with a plastic Yamaha Venova. In 2019 I did more prepared sessions with alto fluteophone. \n\n\n\nIt was in the beginning of August. Very special time for 5 days because of the weather. First days were very cold and the last days were pretty warm. I noticed changes in the \"mood\" of the forest. When I played day to day in some familiar from childhood locations, I felt a different atmosphere and sounds and different spread of the sound of the instrument. Before the first sessions I had some ideas how and what to play, but these ideas just didn't work, when I started each time to listen and \"play\" with the forest. After several failures I decided to play what I can play in real time and how I can react to the forest. After a few more tries I found something and tried to keep this through the next few days. Natural environment around me was always leading me to find something else in my own playing.\n\n\n\nSome videos: \n\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=JXSmGPIJyeQ\n\n  www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAlY6IR5IkI\n\n  www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za77bNkQLKE",

      "about": "Originally released as tape on Cronica (PT) \n\ncronica.bandcamp.com/album/scattered-underfoot\n\n\n\n This album was created in 2020-2021 in the most strange times of the pandemic, when almost all live music was stopped and many had to work from home. Honestly, this was not something totally unusual for me, as I have a habit to compose at the computer when I have some kind of inspiration or, better said, when I try different things. I tend to work on several concurrent pieces at any given time, slowly developing them, and sometimes finding they can come together as an album.\n\n\n\nScattered Underfoot is one of these cases, and it is something new for me. It is an electroacoustic composition that crosses analog and modular synthesis, field recordings, percussion, and processing. This was an experimental process, exploring possibilities for the computer to add its own inputs by developing chance processes. A similar process was developed with the percussion elements, improvising with small setups of snare drum, cymbal, and objects, focusing on sounds rather on playing, as I am not a drummer, after all. Several of these sessions were collected, serving as a starting point to the compositions.\n\n\n\nThere is no randomness in the creative process itself, it all comes from thinking and trying to connect sounds and ideas to each other in, most importantly, new ways that I had not already explored in my previous electroacoustic or acoustic improvised music.",

      "about": "originally released on cassette at Zoomin' Night (Beijing) \n\nzoominnight.bandcamp.com/album/june-21\n\n\n\n The score for June '21 was made in early summer of 2021, in a dialogical process of close live collaboration. Everything we talked about — music, time, politics, and place — was treated as a kind of material with the possibility of being brought into the piece. We didn’t aim to use sound to express such concepts directly, but rather created music with attention to the circumstances: when it was written, where, to whom and by whom it would be played. \n\n\n\nThere was a mutual understanding that we were about to make music between the determined, scored, and the unexpected, improvised: the unexpected both for listeners and for us. Our concept was to actively explore the space together with the audience, trying to reach the effect of co-presence, and the ‘in-between’ of the chamber. The listeners' role was important to us. In a careful, imperceptible dialogue, many risky points of play were made possible with the attentiveness present in the space. We played at the New Stage of Alexandrinsky Theater in St. Petersburg — a large institution that was interesting to try and shake from within, by creating the conditions for more experimental sonic explorations. The black box space was chosen because of the silence that allowed us to concentrate our energy precisely in the ways we intended. \n\n\n\nWe chose to limit the dynamic range to the quiet, which is reflected in the instrumentation. The zither was not Ilia’s main instrument, so he approached the challenge with joy. The objects used on the strings and the body of the instrument made the experience even more playful, at times with no knowledge of what sounds would be produced next. Fluteophone is more familiar to Ilia because of its similarities with the saxophone. It was chosen to contribute with a more classical sound in the selected sections of the performance. Kirill decided to play the material where every sound — tonal, noise, instrumental and electronic — was regarded as separate and independent. This made certain sections consisting of discrete chains of sonic events. \n\n\n\nThe composition and performance were prepared over seven weeks: from initial thoughts about the concert, to writing the score and setting the instrumentation. The 65-minute long cassette is an edited recording of the live performance, with many rebalanced and recomposed details made afterwards. It is hard to say whether the score we wrote, the walks we took together, or the post-performance minutiae were of more significance for the album. This version is produced for home listening, whilst also attempting to create the feeling of the unexpected that we experienced live. \n\n\n\nText by Kirill and Ilia, edited by Sasha Elina",

      "about": "originally released as digital on scatter records (UK) \n\nscatterarchive.bandcamp.com/album/a-fluteophone-in-the-house\n\n\n\n These were sessions recorded in the house which belonged to my family since the early 1990s. It’s still under construction inside; a new house was added to the old one in the beginning of the 2000s. My father died suddenly in December 2021, and in 2022 I had to visit the house every week to clean up the mess - it was also his workspace for many years. During some of those summer days I got the idea that it would be a rare chance to use the empty spaces of the building, to work with the environment as a musician. Once again, fluteophone was my choice of instrument for this task, the same as the recordings from August 2019 in the forest, which also connected with my family’s history. \n\n\n\nThe space itself didn't give me much material to work with; I found it difficult to play. But the surrounding environment was inspirational. \n\nMy state of mind was quite hectic and it was difficult to concentrate. As you may notice, almost all of the pieces are around two minutes long, and that was probably the limit of my attention those days. \n\n\n\nThe house is quite big; 2 floors, the third floor is a mansard, with a smaller old house. In that smaller old house with one room, kitchen and veranda, we spent several summers in the 1990’s with the family; it was a dacha for us. After 25 years, the area around it is totally different and it has almost become the city. I had time to think about the legacy of my father; I tried to remember him and how he helped me search for music CD’s using his old contacts from the 1980’s when he was connected to record collectors of vinyl and tapes. In the mid 1990s he bought a CD-player (which wasn't so common in Russia, because it wasn't so cheap), and it was also the time when I started to listen to the music he collected. It’s my father who nurtured an interest in music for me. I’m not sure you can hear all this sadness and sorrow in the recorded music directly, in most cases I prefer to let the music speak for itself, but this is obviously a very personal collection of pieces and so I can't avoid describing it. \n\n(Ilia Belorukov, January 2023)",

      "credits": "released July 31, 2020\n            \n            \"This composition is based on 1-step pattern with the changing tempo. The idea is to explore how various frequencies sound like, within the same pattern, with different tempo rates. In this piece, apart from drum synthesizer sounds (by themselves making new sounds) format compression pushed to the maximum creates glitches and drones. While trying to fit the track into a limited size of a floppy disk I discovered that a 20 minute piece fits well with the lowest possible mp3 bitrate [8 kHz and 8 kbps]. Originally the piece was recorded as WAV-file 44 kHz and 24 bit. The tempo rates are unusually high. They start from 100BPM to 1000BPM in the first 10 minutes and back from 1000BPM to 100BPM, with the sound reversed, in the following 10 minutes. The tempo is changing in steps of 100BPM and each tempo is played for one minute. First I started with a normal track and after some time discovered that reversed piece also makes sense and it is interesting to compare the differences. Original sounds were synthesized on Nord Drum 2 with four tracks: kick, hat and two kinds of tom sounds. \n\n\n\nRecorded on May 24, 2020.\" \n\n\n\n— Ilia Belorukov",

      "about": "originally released as cassette on Notice Recordings (USA) \n\nnoticerecordings.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n This studio recording of Jason Kahn (voice) and Ilia Belorukov (modular synthesizer) is tense and taut, as dry, crumbling sonic swathes manifest both as machine and human, facilitating an almost ceremonial liberation. Kahn has historically been known for electronic sounds exhibiting stasis and abrasive, enduring minimalism; as of late his work has been primarily concerned with his own unaltered voice. Belorukov’s work exists within the realm of improvised noise and electroacoustics, as he prioritizes a wide range of collaborations. Kahn's voice provides a stark contrast to Belorukov's jagged synthesis, like examining oneself close-up in a mirror. Here, these prolific musicians share a unique, intimate intensity through drastically different approaches.",

      "about": "originally released as cd on Clean Feed (Portugal) \n\ncleanfeed-records.com\n\n\n\n \"There’s souls in the world who, no matter the distance between them, seem destined to meet: alto saxophonist Ilia Belorukov is from Saint Petersburg and drummer Gabriel Ferrandini has Lisbon as his home. Their respective backgrounds, their cultures and the music scenes they belong to couldn’t be more different, and yet, they’re soul brothers. Yes, they share the same disquietness announced by the title of this album, but that’s only the manifestation of something more deep in both of them: their common aloofness to the notion that an artist has to express himself or herself inside tight frames, those of a genre, an aesthetic current, a style. Belorukov is known for his wide range collaborations with musicians and bands going from creative jazz, free improvisation and classical contemporary music to hardcore punk, metal and noise, in every one of those situations always sounding like himself because his own musical universe has aspects we find in all of those tendencies. The use of extended techniques, preparations and electronic devices help him to take the saxophone to unsuspected ranges. The same way, Ferrandini’s approach to the drumkit can fit as much in a free jazz context as, for instance, an art rock one. In a recent interview he said that our contemporaneity is a mix of everything: in his opinion, every jazz drummer should hear Aphex Twin and Squarepusher to become more complete. Here they are together, opening our ears…\"",

Guitarist Pavel Medvedev, known to Intonema's listeners for the release of Moweton project, choreographers Anna Antipova, noted earlier on the disc of Stefan Thut, and Daria Plokhova participated in the creation of the work. This composition consists of two large parts, There & Back. Each of these parts is divided into four more. The main interest of the composer lies in the field of interaction of the frequencies of different sound sources and human movements during running due to changes in tempo. A distinctive feature of the play is the monotony of the material, which contributes to the concentration of the listener in the smallest shades of sound and movement.  \n\n\n\nvimeo.com/210229407 \n\n  vimeo.com/210229728",

      "credits": "released November 1, 2017\n            \n            Played on Casio RZ-1, recorded, edited, mixed and mastered in 2016 by Ilia Belorukov \n\n\n\nI have several pieces which deal with changes in tempo. In 2013 I started to work on a composition called «KickGuitarSinRun», which was presented to the audience only in 2017 via Intonema imprint. It is an audiovisual piece for electric guitar, sine wave, electronic bass drum and a running girl. In the meantime I also worked with changing tempos in the band Wozzeck. The resulting piece, released as an album called «6», was issued on cassette by Spina!Rec. Formally it was 3 pieces, but we did two versions of each piece with different directions in changes in tempo. For example, the first one would be from 85 to 105 BPM and another one the opposite. In all of these works I worked with particular frequencies and the difference between a real instrument (electric guitar or bass guitar) and an electronic part (sine wave or synthesizer): first one played by a human and second one by a computer. «Arzed-one» is my first solo work in this direction and the first one with only electronic instrumentation. This instrument was the Casio RZ-1 drum machine. \n\n\n\nThis model was made in 1986, one year before I was born. It has 12 factory sounds and a possibility to record 4 of your own short samples. In the beginning I used it as typical drum machine to make some beats and rhythm parts and to play live using pads. I wasn’t happy with the result as I didn’t like the 80’s sound enough. But at one rehearsal I found that this instrument has a lively soul when you make some stupid things. I played a pattern with several sounds and each of these sounds was played using every 16 steps of the sequencer. It was like a joke, but when I set the tempo above 160 BPM I started to hear a lot of unexpected relationships between sounds. The time between every step was so small that it sounded almost like drone music to me. When I started to change the tempo this drone started to sound different. Each time it stayed the same, but there was also something different in the small nuances. You can hear a main rhythm, while some other rhythms happen occasionally, even some clear notes. I enjoyed this unstable system a lot and worked with on this album. I used only 6 factory sounds: kick, snare, open/closed hi hat, clap, cowbell. You will hear it without any effects except equalization and very small compression. I recorded the material live with several outputs and room sound, then edited it a bit and mixed to some pieces.

If they want to know what I'm doing all they have to do is read it on the screen, they don't even need to leave the house. They make mistakes. They have the power but they make mistakes. I never make any, that's my trump card. Hoffka!\" he said. He shook his long hands before his forehead.\" The bitch! Hoffka! Paffka! Suffka! Do you want any more?\" \n\n— Jean-Paul Sartre \"The Room\" \n\n\n\nIlia Belorukov and Kurt Liedwart work together since 2009, they used to combine exquisite and fragile saxophone playing with sinewaves, field recordings and quiet noises, sometimes Kurt Liedwart dropped his instruments, electronics and laptop, in favor of working with objects and space. “Sufka” is the last installment in the series of releases on Mikroton Digital. It was recorded during the duo’s tour in Lisbon in “Carpe Diem Arte e Pesquisa” in very special circumstances. \n\nErnesto Rodrigues: Kurt, unfortunately, we have to cancel today’s concert because there’s no electricity in the venue. \n\nKurt Liedwart: We can play without electricity, I’m not so lovingly attached to my instruments, I can play with objects, body, and space. \n\nIn half an hour we were already in the car going to the gallery without electricity where this concert was recorded.",

I made the first recordings for this record in Hammerfest (Norway) in 2014 during the residency of the Foxes Fluff duo, where I work with choreographer Anna Antipova. We used lots of cardboard boxes in our performance. Their sound was recorded with contact mics.\n\n\n\nIn 2015, in Poznan (Poland), I happened to be in a cozy café where you got a balloon with your order.

The box and the balloon spoke to me for one simple reason—I play the saxophone. Seemingly, there’s nothing alike between the musical instrument and these ordinary things. But I don’t just breathe into the saxophone (like a balloon) but also use the surface of the instrument for phonation (and I used the surface of the box the same way). And the sound of the balloon is somewhat similar, but the cardboard of the box is very different from the saxophone’s metal. I didn’t process the raw sound beyond recognition in principle, but worked mainly with equalization and editing.\n\n\n\nWhat interested me was the overlapping of different sound layers, using silence and side sounds, the rough and raw source material, electronic noise, and rhythmic patterns played live.",

If they want to know what I'm doing all they have to do is read it on the screen, they don't even need to leave the house. They make mistakes. They have the power but they make mistakes. I never make any, that's my trump card. Hoffka!\" he said. He shook his long hands before his forehead.\" The bitch! Hoffka! Paffka! Suffka! Do you want any more?\" \n\n— Jean-Paul Sartre \"The Room\" \n\n\n\nIlia Belorukov and Andrey Popovskiy work together since 2007. In the beginning they played free improvisation, ambient and quiet music. Now they focus on researching the space, interaction between music and performance and they look for new context for found sounds. On “Pafka”, which continues the series of releases on Mikroton Digital, Ilia and Andrey work in the Experimental Sound Gallery, trying to find a fresh attitude in a well-known space, experimenting with instruments and means for making sounds.",

      "about": "originally released as digital on Mikroton Digital (Russia)\n\n\n\n\"I wonder what they want,\" he said at last. \"That fellow has already been here. Why did they send him to me? If they want to know what I'm doing all they have to do is read it on the screen, they don't even need to leave the house. They make mistakes. They have the power but they make mistakes. I never make any, that's my trump card. Hoffka!\" he said. He shook his long hands before his forehead.\" The bitch! Hoffka! Paffka! Suffka! Do you want any more?\" \n\n— Jean-Paul Sartre \"The Room\" \n\n\n\nThe first instalment in the new incarnation focuses on metamusic, sound/space and performance. It was recorded in 2013 on July 12th in Art Liga Gallery by Ilia Belorukov﻿ and Denis Sorokin﻿. After they met 1 hour and a half before the concert, Ilia devised a plan of the concert, wrote instructions for Denis, placed different sound sources around the space, balanced the volumes and checked the sound. For instance, the second half of Denis' guitar part is a guitar solo from a Metallica's song but nobody will figure it out due to the following reasons: 1) it's performed 3-4 times slower, 2) it's performed on a completely detuned guitar. Denis walks around the space, he had instructions not only what and when to play but also where to play. Ilia's parts are entirely improvisational but he moved around the space as well.",

      "about": "originally released on Intonema / Akt-Produkt (Russia) \n\nwww.intonema.org \n\n  www.vovne.ru \n\n\n\n Solo performance of Ilia Belorukov in Tomsk after the festival of different kinds of arts «Theses» (Kemerovo), 46 minutes 46 seconds by length, separated into 3 parts for convenience. Ilia plays alto sax using preparations and extended sound making techniques (breathing into the tube, knocking on the surfaces etc.), presenting the embodied «death» of the instrument to the grateful Siberian public. However this «death» becomes in some sense a prolongation of micromovements of a weird post-life. \n\n\n\nWe've got here a rather minimalistic sound document: an investigation of indiscernibilties, extremities of sound field, a balancing on the edge of scarcely audible, a stay between shadows of sound and even shadows of shadows of sound close to its nonexistence. But this tendency for «nullity» and reduction turns also into a test of boundaries between, let's say, «music» and «non-music», probing their mangled edges, groping for gaps in the coordinate system of «contemporary music», for lacunas in the text it's made of. This groping movement turns out to be a random movement and at that particular moment it becomes a successful one (but that's how things go in improvised music basically). Meanwhile the traces of hard work appear here and there, this rupturing movement is methodically and well organized. However its organization, a real-time composition in its turn is also presented-at-hand and it does not prevail over sound matter, the structure itself becomes a part of something that resembles the structure. No plot, no story, there's just a trace of something familiar. Fascinating, meditative movement, a space. (Maxim Evstropov)",
