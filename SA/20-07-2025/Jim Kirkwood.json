      "about": "Drawing inspiration from the fantastical and philosophical musings of Michael Moorcock, Jim Kirkwood embarked on a profound exploration of Melnibonéan mythos with this trilogy of albums originally released in the early 1990s, aptly titled \"The Eternal Champion Trilogy\".\n\n\n\nTales from a Melnibone Tavern (oos234/DEI-004) sets the stage with atmospheric compositions that echo the decadent and tragic nature of Elric’s homeland, weaving an intricate tapestry of sorrow and grandeur.\n\n\n\nSouls that Dance on the Edge of a Sword (oos235/DEI-005) delves deeper into Moorcock’s existential themes, its haunting melodies evoking the chaos and carnage wrought by Stormbringer, the cursed Black Sword.\n\n\n\nFinally, Kirkwood’s Master of Dragons (oos236/DEI-006), widely regarded as his magnum opus, brings the trilogy to a climactic resolution with sweeping, cinematic compositions that capture both the metaphysical gravity and epic scope of Moorcock’s multiverse.\n\n\n\nThrough this trilogy, Kirkwood masterfully balances the tension between chaos and order, underscoring his belief in the eternal nature of the soul—a poignant counterpoint to the nihilistic undertones of Moorcock’s work.",

      "about": "➡️ Funds generated from this album will be donated to the Kent Wildlife Trust in Maidstone, Kent, England (UK Registered Charity No: 239992) -  www.kentwildlifetrust.org.uk  ⬅️\n\n\n\nOut of Season and Hosianna Mantra are proud to announce the launch of the first-ever reissue campaign of the works of cult fantasy synth figure Jim Kirkwood, whose original compositions predated by several years the legendary dark ambient progenitors of what would later be rebranded as “dungeon synth”. Kirkwood's musical style was unique from his contemporaries, falling less in-line musically with the medieval, subterranean dread of his peers and more with artists like Mort Garson (Plantasia, Atraxia's The Unexplained, etc.). Kirkwood incorporated a far more diverse palette of influences such as the Berlin School (Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Klaus Schulze, etc.) of electronic music, John Carpenter's synth-driven soundtrack compositions, and, perhaps most importantly, a spiritual foundation akin to the New Age cassette culture of the 1980's, albeit much darker.\n\n\n\nKirkwood's immense body of work functioned as an aural adaptation, thematically centered around the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings), Michael Moorcock (The Elric Saga), Neil Gaiman (Sandman), Celtic Mythology, and the Norse Poetic Edda. With singular vision and unmatched dedication, Kirkwood released two dozen full-length cassettes from 1990-1996 to virtually no audience but himself and his closest confidants. As such, this original run of recorded material languished in total obscurity before being rediscovered by underground fans in the last decade, resulting in the sudden, long-overdue recognition of the genius of Jim Kirkwood.\n\n\n\nFirst discovering The Hobbit at the age of 13, his rabid consumption of the seminal works of fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien can be considered the impetus for Kirkwood’s musical career. Perhaps in an effort to sustain the sense of magical escapism of experiencing The Lord of the Rings trilogy during idyllic British summers, Kirkwood’s solo musical journey began in Middle Earth with Where Shadows Lie (1990, oos-204/DEI-001). This kickstarted a deluge of unbridled and prolific creativity resulting in multiple tape releases, including two other Tolkien-inspired albums, King of the Golden Hall (1991, oos-205/DEI-002) and Uruk-Hai (1992, oos-206/DEI-003). This series of albums would come to form some of Kirkwood’s most well-regarded work, a collection which would become known as his Middle Earth Trilogy.",

      "about": "By my own standards this has been a while coming. I my defense, i can only point to the length of this project so far, over 10 hours of music and quite a bit of accompanying artwork.(yes, I must get out more) I have labelled this album as parts 1-7. This is for convenience sake so that it can be so divided and copied onto 10 CDs if you so wish. It is actually a single album and as yet incomplete. I am writing a story which is acting as the source of inspiration for the music. It is directly related to my other Tenebrae albums, including \"The Hermit of Bryn or Garreg\" As I have said already, the story is largely inspired by C.S.lewis's book, The Great Divorce. It is Gothic and Otherworldly. The music is appropriately, I think, tagged by myself as Gothic EM. It is safe to say, the music can be enjoyed on many levels and if you like my other releases, is consistent in style with those. It is also to some extent, though not completely, autobiographical. It begins in the year 1862. (I really am not that old) and concerns a man, an artist, judged to be insane and imprisoned in Bedlam, who dies for a period of seven days before returning with a tale that was seven years in the making! It is about parallel worlds and histories, gods and angels, spiritual possession and redemption, adventure and a journey through another dimension and world, and of course, an apocalypse. There is always going to be an apocalypse. lol I hope you enjoy the ride.",

      "about": "➡️ Funds generated from this album will be donated to the Folly Wildlife Rescue in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England (UK Registered Charity No: 1091857) -  www.follywildliferescue.org.uk  ⬅️\n\n\n\nOut of Season and Hosianna Mantra are proud to announce the launch of the first-ever reissue campaign of the works of cult fantasy synth figure Jim Kirkwood, whose original compositions predated by several years the legendary dark ambient progenitors of what would later be rebranded as “dungeon synth”. Kirkwood's musical style was unique from his contemporaries, falling less in-line musically with the medieval, subterranean dread of his peers and more with artists like Mort Garson (Plantasia, Atraxia's The Unexplained, etc.). Kirkwood incorporated a far more diverse palette of influences such as the Berlin School (Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk, Klaus Schulze, etc.) of electronic music, John Carpenter's synth-driven soundtrack compositions, and, perhaps most importantly, a spiritual foundation akin to the New Age cassette culture of the 1980's, albeit much darker.\n\n\n\nKirkwood's immense body of work functioned as an aural adaptation, thematically centered around the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (The Lord of the Rings), Michael Moorcock (The Elric Saga), Neil Gaiman (Sandman), Celtic Mythology, and the Norse Poetic Edda. With singular vision and unmatched dedication, Kirkwood released two dozen full-length cassettes from 1990-1996 to virtually no audience but himself and his closest confidants. As such, this original run of recorded material languished in total obscurity before being rediscovered by underground fans in the last decade, resulting in the sudden, long-overdue recognition of the genius of Jim Kirkwood.\n\n\n\nFirst discovering The Hobbit at the age of 13, his rabid consumption of the seminal works of fantasy author J.R.R. Tolkien can be considered the impetus for Kirkwood’s musical career. Perhaps in an effort to sustain the sense of magical escapism of experiencing The Lord of the Rings trilogy during idyllic British summers, Kirkwood’s solo musical journey began in Middle Earth with Where Shadows Lie (1990, oos-204/DEI-001). This kickstarted a deluge of unbridled and prolific creativity resulting in multiple tape releases, including two other Tolkien-inspired albums, King of the Golden Hall (1991, oos-205/DEI-002) and Uruk-Hai (1992, oos-206/DEI-003). This series of albums would come to form some of Kirkwood’s most well-regarded work, a collection which would become known as his Middle Earth Trilogy.",

      "about": "The tracks on this double CD span a period of approximately ten years. I say approximately because one or two of them are a mystery even to myself. The first track, Saruman of Many Colours, probably the oldest, I have only the vaguest memory writing. It turned up in the collection of a friend. I must have sent it to him and forgotten about it! I never was methodical or tidy in my work. Shame on me lol. Two other tracks, \"Beyond the Fields We Know\" and \"Under a Different Sky\" are also titles of albums. But don't appear on those releases. \"Steam Flowers for Camellia\" and \"Ding Dong Bell\" were the last pieces of music I wrote before my \"Holiday\".\n\n\"Black Dog Moor\" also appears on the \"Foxhalt Marsh\" mini album. \"Cirith Ungol\" was a track I wrote for \"The First Ring\" a compilation of Tolkien inspired music released on a French Record Label and I believe is still available. Worth checking out! \"I Will Run Like a Hare\" was a track I wrote at the time of \"The Darkening Hour\" CD as a kind of Bonus track. \"A Splinter of Wilderness\", \"Under a Different Sky\" and \"Beyond the Fields we Know\" were all originally part of the \"Hecate\" Double CD which I renamed \"These Lanterns of Dust/Under a Different Sky\". Hope you enjoy it. A special thankyou to Sanders for the tracks I thought were gone and are now resurrected!\n\n\n\nThank you Steve and Sanders without whom this Collection would not have been possible.\n\n\n\nGo care-lessly\n\n\n\nJim",

      "about": "The fifth album in the Tenebrae series that explores the storyline of a mythical, purgatorial city and the souls who live there, before going on to one of two destinies. (To the Wonderous Gate or Beyond the Stones) To all intents and purposes, this is very much a Victorian version of London in all is cosmopolitan and steam-punk glory, but far more vast in scope. (Thousands of square miles and relatively unmapped) In fact, no one who lives there knows of any prior existence, or that they died in that previous life. It would seem to them no different to how we live and move in our world, with a few exceptions. They do not age or have children. All the characters in the storyline are from other works of fiction. So this is a purgatory for fictional characters. The idea for this story stems directly from a book by CS Lewis, the writer of the Narnia chronicles, called \"The Great Divorce\". And I have used one of the main characters from the Narnia series in my own story, Canterbury Black. Another character is Detective Inspector Zachariah Winters. The title of the album is an obvious clue to his previous existence. the name, Mayor Rit, is an obvious anagram of a famous bad guy. The Far Green Country is a term used by Tolkien in Lord of the Rings for the paradisal Otherworld. In my story it is the road taken by pilgrims to the Wonderous Gate and beyond. Heaven.",

      "about": "This is the first of seven albums I have planned to release inspired by the Chronicles of Narnia by C.S.Lewis. The title of the album comes from the book \"The Magicians Nephew\". The final track Tenebrae- The Sign of the Archer might need a brief word. It has two meanings. The first, is that it is a reference to the constellation of Orion the archer who is the herald of winter. The next Book in the series is the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe where Narnia has become a winter world because of the magic of the evil Queen Jadis. (The White Witch). The second meaning is a reference to Susan, who in my own storyline of Tenebrae is the master archer, Canterbury Black. The music however, like all my albums, is instrumental in nature and lends itself to the imagination of the listener. I wish you a pleasant journey. \n\nIt is also a well known fact that Lewis himself was a Christian and the Narnia stories are heavily allegorical in nature. There is a positive message here. In a world that is rapidly going to hell in a handcart, we desperately need some \"good news\".",

      "about": "This is the album I get the most requests for. It has taken me longer than I expected to get it all together and for that I do apologise. For those folks who like to do their own CD hard copy, you will need three CD's. Two for the re-written material of which there is over two hours and a third for the free bonus tracks which are the remastered original tapes. I did my best with these original tape recordings. They were not in the best condition as anyone listening to them on headphones will verify. There you are, they are what they are warts and all.\n\nConcerning the new material The three parts of the Master of Dragons tracks are made up of various parts themselves. The inner to the cover details the timings for those that are interested. I hope you like what I have done. This is one of the most important albums I have done in regards the ongoing storyline I am following and using for inspiration. It ties together my early work with the Tenebrae project.\n\n\n\nThe artwork came out of my head and was achieved using acrylic paint and artist quality coloured pencils. The image is an amalgamation of Elric and a Chaos Dragon and a glimpse of one of the older parts of the City of Tenebrae. Anyone who wants to know more about this subject and album feel free to contact me. \n\n\n\nGod bless you for all your support and encouragement over the years, not to mention your patience with this wayward son of EM.",

      "about": "Twilight of the Celts has a long history. It began life as a cassette release pre-dating the nine Yggdrasil cassettes I did. and was expanded later as a CD. I did some light remixing sometime round about 2010. It is an album I have always been rather fond of, both musically speaking and in its source of Inspiration. Celtic myth, and its subsequent journey into The Christian faith, has a strong pull for me, especially the presence of the Other within Nature so obvious in the myths themselves and the lives of the Celtic peoples still influential to this day. Once we get past the blatantly fraudulent claims of the neo pagans and what claims to be the Celtic church today, we can find something enduringly real, and dare I say, relevant for today. I hope you enjoy it and the new artwork I have done for this album. The figure on the cover is based upon a Stained Glass window of St Brigid and the synth in the background is a section of an Arp 2600.\n\n\n\nGo care-lessly\n\n\n\nJim",

      "about": "A double CD of Melodic Instrumental Electronic Music with a Darkly Gothic Twist for your ears to enjoy and your mind to ride along with. These last two months have been quite productive and here are the results. I really must get out more!!! Like all my music, there is a story behind the inspiration, which is a continuation of my Tenebrae series. So, what exactly is Tenebrae? I have explained some of the meaning in the notes to my other albums but for the sake of clarity, here are a few more. Tenebrae, as I have conceived it, is a city. Or so it appears. It is certainly more than that, however. It might be better to think of the city as a gate between Worlds in which the decisions made by the people who find themselves there, and to all intents and purposes interact and get on with life with no recollection of there having ever been anything else, are crucially important to their ultimate fate. This is especially true in regards to the afterlife, and what they believe it is, or is not. The idea shares a great deal in common with various movies, Lost, The Dark City, The Trueman Show, etc. The main character in my story, D.I Zachariah Winters, begins, with the help of two friends, a dog named Toby, and “Canny”, Ms Canterbury Black, to wake up to the true nature of the City and his own soul. Zach is an officer of the Law, which is ironic given that he was, in a previous existence, a servant of Chaos in which he wielded a black sword that delighted in bloodshed and was also unimaginably evil. The same sword, which he had come to depend upon in that life because of his albino weakness, ultimately murdered him and “drank” his soul. Perhaps I should reiterate here how I came up with this idea for Tenebrae. I took as my primary sources two books. The first, by C.S.Lewis, (the author of the Chronicles of Narnia), was the Great Divorce. The second, by Michael Moorcock, was the Elric Saga. A combination of the two seems highly unlikely. Bear with me. I wondered what happened to the soul of Elric after he was slain by the above mentioned black sword, Stormbringer. Now, Moorcock would argue that the soul was no more than energy to be passed on and used by the vampiric Stormbringer. We are not given much information on Stormbringer other than it was a sentient being, evil, and which became the Satan of our world after the destruction of the old Earth. (Both Moorcock and Tolkien set their fantasy world as a prequel to the world as it is now. Lewis took a different track, and set his Narnia world as a sideways or alternative reality.) And Lewis, on the other hand, believed in the existence of the soul after death, as evidenced in all his writings, but particularly, the Great Divorce. I am firmly in the Lewis camp. So, yes, I am biased in my opinion. So a hybridization of ideas was born. You can listen to the music for its own sake if you so wish. But I note my sources so that you may share something of my own journey. \"This is pure fantasy\", I hear someone say. True. But like the “Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe”, it points to a greater reality. Every decision we make has consequences for good or ill. Life itself is a constant opportunity to choose what we believe or not. As the strange knight in the Indiana Jones movie, the Last Crusade, said, we must choose wisely before we raise the final cup. \n\n\n\nPerhaps I should also mention, that Tenebrae carries the meaning of “darkness” and refers to the Catholic ritual of that name, celebrating the three days of darkness spent by Christ in the tomb following his death and before his resurrection. This is mirrored in the three days of darkness in the book of Exodus, and the three days of darkness to come in the book of Revelation. So we see, God is no stranger to the recycling of ideas and reality.\n\nEnjoy!",

      "about": "This Project, which I began in 2011, came as a complete surprise. Why? Glad you asked. I thought it was lost when a drive I had the project on suffered a catastrophic collapse taking everything with it. Most of what I had on the drive was backed up elsewhere, following the old formula of nothing exists in the digital world unless it exists in two places. But I had nearly five hours of music which I tagged \"The Garden of Earthly Delights\", not backed up. Gone. Or so I thought. Not long after that I took a \"semi retirement\" from writing music and the whole episode was buried and forgotten for eight years. Until now. Whilst I was still working on the fifth instalment of the project, I had sent a preliminary copy of the work totalling four hours to a friend who lives on the Isle of Wight. Just recently I was in touch with Steve who reminded me he still had some unreleased material that didn't appear on the any of the lists commonly found on the internet. You could have knocked me down with a feather, as they say. I had no idea or memory of sending it to him. Talk about a miracle! So here we are, and a big thank you to Steve, who promptly copied the discs and sent them to me. Not only did I now have all this material returned to me, I still had the original notes in a notebook including the track breakdown titles and times. The main title comes from a work by the artist Heironymous Bosch, a strange person, who many say belonged to a Christian cult. You can look at his work on line especially the tryptic of that name. Be warned, it isn't comfortable viewing. It is a cynical and darkly humorous work and some of the scenes some might find offensive. The Rock band, Deep Purple used the depictions of Hell on one of their early albums. Well, so much for the source of the inspiration. There was something otherworldly about it that appealed to me and the ideas I had at the time, and which resurfaced in the Tenebrae project I was now working on. There is so much more I need to write about this but space and time doesn't allow for it. Perhaps elsewhere. For now, here it is for your enjoyment.\n\n\n\nJim\n\n\n\nGo care-lessly",

Once again, a special thanks to Steve on the Isle of Wight for telling me he had music that I thought was long since lost. Well, here it is, parts 3-4 of this project. I repeat here some of the notes I posted on Vol 1...The main title comes from a work by the artist Heironymous Bosch, a strange person, who many say belonged to an even stranger Christian cult.

Well, so much for the source of the inspiration. There was something otherworldly about it that appealed to me and the ideas I had at the time, and which resurfaced in the Tenebrae project I was now working on. The word Tenebrae, which means \"darkness\" actually refers to the period of darkness before the resurrection of Christ from the tomb and forms part of the liturgy of the Catholic church. I have used it as a name for the city around which I have created a storyline. The main character in the story, D.I. Zachariah Winters, who has no memory of how he came to be in this city of Tenebrae, has an encounter \"apparition\" with an evil being who has a habit of taking the shape of a \"black sword\". This brings about a process of remembering, and also an awakening to the fact that Tenebrae is not what it seems!",

      "about": "Although the music for this album, which is over two hours long, is unashamedly Gothic EM, and is consistent in style, the concept, history and many sources of inspiration behind this album make it a complex, of interwoven themes, a Matrix, if you will. One of these themes is the idea of a parallel world, an idea that is present throughout my back catalogue. The \"Hidden Village\", the village no one can see, was the main theme of my \"Foxhalt Edge\" album and continued in \"Canterbury Black\" and \"Corvis Christi\" albums. On the full cover of this album, I painted in the upper left, the figure of C.S.Lewis, whose writings were the primary source of inspiration. In particular, The Chronicles of Narnia and the idea that we can disappear into another world, a fact that most religious people will tell you is ultimately inevitable. The only important question is the nature of these worlds and our own personal destination toward or away from them. Another work of Mr Lewis (saint Jack!) that goes some way to offering a possible explanation is \"The Great Divorce\" . Heaven, Hell, and Purgatory are all brought into focus, in a somewhat tongue in cheek fashion, where the main protagonist takes a bus ride from the \"City\", (Purgatory or Hell) for a day trip to Paradise accompanied by some very interesting characters who have some very interesting ideas about life and death. I decided I would create my own story, and City (Tenebrae). I borrowed some ideas from a sci-fi movie, The Dark City, and of course, the Matrix. And possibly the Truman show. \n\nMy own protagonist, D.I. Zachariah Winters, makes some alarming discoveries about the place where he lives and his own history. This brings together another theme, Grace and Redemption. Zach is a character based upon a failed hero from a Michael Moorcock book who comes to a particularly unpleasant end. But is it the end? You can work out who he is from the title of the tenth track. This track is a kind of re-write in part of one of my earlier cassettes. I think of it more of a variation on a theme which I have woven into the story. Of course, it is not my intention to \"hi-jack\" (pun not intended) Mr Moorcock's work or to say what he actually believes or not. These ideas are my own and responsibility for them rests on my shoulders alone. Why do it? Well, because its fun, because I can, and it is a good way of exploring and discovering what I personally believe. Sometimes we don't know what we really believe until we act upon it. so this journey is a personal one of delight and discovery. A pilgrimage, yes. Alternatively, you can just listen to the music and enjoy it, but it is always my hope that it might grip your imagination, and sweep you off to unknown vistas, in a good sort of way. Bilbo Baggins might have something to say about that! Like our own world this journey is full of light and shadow, the knowledge of good and evil, and the music reflects that reality. The journey for all us begins now and from where we are. I wish you God speed and pray you make the right choices.",

For instance, the first track was originally titled \"Me Tog Ma\", a Tibetan deity. I renamed it \"The Tragedy of Tibet\" in reference to the Chinese invasion of that country which reflects more properly the original inspiration behind the music. And make no mistake the Chinese invasion was a tragedy and still is an appalling infringement of human rights. This track contains a number of famous actors doing voice overs protesting the invasion. Have fun trying to work out whose who!",

      "about": "Well, here is a bit of history I thought I had left behind. Perhaps I would have done if so many people had not asked for it. I have done my best with the source material. These tracks represent the original three albums of Middle Earth that I did, Where shadows lie, King of the Golden Hall, and Uruk Hai. They were recorded on low tech equipment , an old eight track tape deck and a few bits of equipment, synths and effects. So far from where I ended up. the process has also involved a transition from cassette tape to MP3 to Flac. There you go, warts and all as they say. Despite all that they have a certain charm I think. Sorry in advance for the lack of bonus on this album. I no longer have any covers etc.",

      "about": "Back in the day I released three albums with the titles inspired by the Myths and Legends of Vampires. These albums were titled \"Blood and Feathers\", \"A Shroud of Many Colours\" and \"The Blessing of Shadows\". Why? That is a really good question. At the time I thought it was a good idea, inspired by my reading material on the legends of the Nephalim, and their Fallen Angel parents. So truly, these were going to be albums about Angels but I got a bit side tracked by a few trashy novels of a Gothic nature. The music on these three albums is here released under one umbrella, titled \" ArchAngel\". I have taken the opportunity to re-imagine the individual titles of the tracks bringing them more in line with the original intent and up to date with what I currently believe. 3 Hours of music for your enjoyment.",

I can't for the life of me remember why I used these titles for a collection of music about the nature of reality which was about my spiritual quest at the time and nothing whatsoever to do with some mythical goddess of the Underworld. I was looking into Holographic realities back then, which, on the face of it, seemed quite convincing. Many people hold to this view, which is not so far away from the Buddhist view of the world being an illusion. I no longer think this way, even though I do think the World system we all live under has in many respects, pulled the wool over our eyes. We could talk all day about conspiracy theories! lol I have included here in the bonus materials two sets of artwork for those who want to recreate actual CDs.",

It left me with a terrible feeling that I had just come face to face with something utterly alien and evil. at the time my Spiritual world view had no peg on which to hang this experience. I think, like most people, my view of spiritual evil at the time was somewhat tongue in cheek with more than a nod toward Hollywood. After my encounter everything changed. It took a long time to eventually come to some understanding of what it was I saw and felt. And I can assure you, no drugs were involved.. No words were exchanged. It didn't introduce itself by saying \"pleased to meet you, can you guess my name.\" We can hide from the truth if we want to. But there is another dimension out there which is utterly hostile to us and ultimately seeks our demise. Anyway, this album.....need I say more.",

      "about": "This album was inspired by a book. Probably a lot of books as one book is want to lead to another alongside the events of ones life. Hawksmoor a novel by Peter Ackroyd. After reading the book I caught the train to London to see for myself the Churches built by Nicholas Hawksmoor. It was a strange and disturbing experience. I really did have the experience of \"Otherness\". Almost without exception these white and ghostly churches seemed to attract more than their fair share of homeless alcoholics and stray dogs who followed my movements with hostility. Who knows what darkness peered out from behind those eyes. Eyes that mirrored the dark windows of the churches themselves. perhaps none of this should come as a surprise. Hawksmoor was inspired in his architecture by the giant stones of Baalbek, itself named for Baal, the ancient demon god who delighted in human sacrifice. For myself, I do not regret the experience, only the motive, for it was one more step on a journey out of my personal darkness into the light.",

The background was done in encaustic wax which I then painted over that in acrylics. Never again! I took as a theme for the music Shakespears' Midsummer Nights Dream. It was a one off project. The music is very much EM in the Berlin School.",

      "about": "Back in the day I was inspired to write a short story about the \"hidden village\". I named it Foxhalt Edge, though folklore it has many names. The music was inspired by that story. The album title is not, as some have supposed, a dig at the Christian church, but is the name of one of many characters in the background story which inspired this work. Ms Canterbury \"Canny\" Black has resurfaced again in the Tenebrae storyline along with Fr John Corvis Christi. CB is part of a series of albums related to Foxhalt Edge. (The village no one can see). It is the heart of the City of Tenebrae and can only be found by the true Pilgrim and the use of an Apocalyptagon. This is a kind of compass which points to that which is hidden.",

I recently walked the pilgrim route at Walsingham, in Norfolk, a short walk from the old slipper chapel to the Abbey ruins. It is interesting how these things can affect you, Pilgrimages are rather like life, not always straight forward, certainly not what you might expect. Beyond the ruins there is a river, and a bridge, and I am wondering where it leads to...….",

They don't usually live that long being vulnerable and rejected by their own community. this is the inspiration behind my crow albums, the crow being an allegory for the spiritual journey of the soul, my journey, and its hopeful redemption beyond the gates of death. I do believe in God, so death for me is not the end or extinction of life. but we do need to think about it and not pretend its not going to happen. Death is a gate at the end of the crooked path we call life.",

      "about": "Originally, this was a short track on one of my early albums. It was something like 10 mins long. This album is over an Hour. so as rewrites go it was pretty extensive. No apologies for that. a few seconds of the original material can be heard here and there. but no more than that. The fact is, I liked the idea more than the original result so I rewrote it. Enjoy, and don't forget the bonus covers to make up a real cd if that is what you desire.",

The decay and change we see around us now is telling us something, something important. We need to be ready.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, when you download this album don't forget the bonus materials that allow you to make up a CD. So enjoy it while you can. Lol",

Relics seem to be an important part of the Catholic tradition. You can touch the past and in a spiritual sense connect with the Future. Maybe there is a saint somewhere who once rode a Harley. The crow in me likes that idea. And do not forget your bonus materials in the form of cd covers etc. All the albums have extra materials to make up a real CD.",
