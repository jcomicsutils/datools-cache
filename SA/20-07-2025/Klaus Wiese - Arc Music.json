A word, often used to simply describe a sensation of calmness. The album \"Rest\" was created to explore a deeper understanding of this topic through tones, sound and music. To reach such a divine way of being, much more is required than thinking about it in terms of language. Additionally, there are several other important stages which have to be passed, before arriving at a complete feeling of restfulness. As with steps taken to reach hypnosis, deep rest can be entered through repetition and constant focus, which helps relieve the mind from external distractions. Once reached, a second phase starts where thoughts turn increasingly \"liquid\" and slowly fade away, while gradually giving way to true \"Rest\" (Klaus Wiese)",

Stretched in time, referring to a fundamental expression of beauty, it offers more a perfume in a psychic room than an impressive design. Ming Noir is meant to act on an unseen presence, in which melodic moods manifest and disappear into the movements of an undefined background.\n\n\n\nWith the new re-mastered version, it´s now possible to run the CD at very low volumes with the music still filling the room. Because of some special spatial treatments used in the mastering, it´s even possible to capture the content by listening from other rooms, without the necessity of raising the volume heavily (for example, for more indirect listening experiences while concentrating, working or falling asleep).",

Most albums by Wiese are clearly split into releases with a more acoustic approach (e.g. \"Klangschalen\"), while other CDs like \"Space\" + \"Maquam\" had a very spatious, hypnotic and timelessly ambient feeling. Shape I focuses on the latter style, inviting the listener to experience a deep, lasting journey through time and space.",

The album includes 3 very long tracks, offering hypnotic expanding soundscapes and subtle rhythms leading to a mental Trance state. \"Maquam\" works perfectly in repeat mode for slow movement, meditation and sleep purposes. With the new re-mastered version, it´s now possible to run the album at very low volumes with the music still filling the room. Because of some special spatial treatments used in the mastering, it´s even possible to capture the content by listening from other rooms, without the necessity of raising the volume heavily (for example, for more indirect listening experiences while concentrating, working or falling asleep).\n\n\n\nMaquam, translating to \"stations\" in Arabic, is a term that references the various stages a Sufi's soul must attain in its search for God. The stations are derived from the most routine considerations a Sufi must deal with on a day-to-day basis and is essentially an embodiment of mystical knowledge",

In its soteriological and eschatological senses, it refers to freedom from saṃsāra, the cycle of death and rebirth. In its epistemological and psychological senses, moksha refers to freedom from ignorance: self-realization and self-knowledge.",
