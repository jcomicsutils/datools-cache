            "about": "FUR CLEMT IS LOCAL DIALECT FOR 'VERY HUNGRY'.\nRECORDED AGE 21/22, ON TAPE WITH 4 TRACK, 8 TRACK AND COMPUTER.\nMore 'songs' that are more song-like than ever, allowed to be finished after long months of cramped living. Wanting a home. Not particularly thought-out. Probably too defensively vague but bigger and more elaborate. There are lots of words about family. I'm very sorry. brotherbrotherbrotherbrotherbrotherbrother.\nThank you to Virginia, as well as Thee Mouth of Heaven Collective. Special thanks to Hannah for their forever support and care, as well as the 'PUMPKIN' poster art. Carolyn Higgins creates folk art, and created the album's embroidered front cover. Sorry to Mount Seldom's Mikhail, who never got to hear these songs. Constant thanks to you, for reading and for listening.\nIf you'd like to add this album to your bandcamp collection but don't have the funds, please get in touch. I'd rather you have it.",
