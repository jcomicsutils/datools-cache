            "about": "All music composed & produced by Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana. Real time performance and recording by Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana at the Serenity Studio, Belgium in October 1997.\nMastered by Roger King.\nDesign by Sam Rosenthal.\nOriginally released on Projekt Records (3cd, 1999)",
            "credits": "released April 3, 2025\nAscension of Shadows\n20th anniversary celebration\nSteve Roach / Vidna Obmana’s 1999 release was an ultra-immersive 3CD collection subtitled “Meditations For the Millennium.” With the intention of creating a place of solace for what they were sensing with the approaching year 2000 and beyond, the three and a half hour work feels especially potent and nourishing when revisited today. Available as a limited edition of 2000, it quickly sold out and remains a popular title with Roach/Obmana fans. To celebrate 20 years, Projekt makes Ascension of Shadows a name-your-price download here at Bandcamp for a limited time.\n“This set remain’s among our favorite work from the many collaborations we created together. Recorded in Belgium in October 1997, the music creation flowed over the course of a week, with each day building to the next. During this time in the studio, our collaborative/improvisational connection moved towards a telepathic interaction. This mode is the place we thrived. We hardly spoke words, working instinctually and speaking though sounds and music; always reaching for an expression of pure emotion that emanated from the cracks between worlds to which our ears were tuned. Twenty years later it feels like we just created this last week.”\n- Steve Roach - Vidna Obmana 12-10-19\nA review of Ascension of Shadows from MUZE by Darren Bergstein:\nSome of Roach and Obmana’s most introspective and immersive recordings in years. Drones wrenched out of some nameless void cruise slowly through great vacuums of space, the only intrusion coming from stark, unearthly tones that sometimes grow, sometimes recede, into the ebony background. Using a vast array of sound and signal processors, synths and a number of acoustic noise-makers, Roach/Obmana may very well be the acknowledged masters of “anti”-ambient music, music that emerges from the shadows, often erupting out of the blackness, in your face and probing, but simultaneously willing to nestle comfortably in the darkness. These are sounds that might seem to be nearly imperceptible until they suddenly grab the surrounding environment in their awe-inspiring, immense grip. Inner space music with a definable edge.",

            "credits": "released April 3, 2025\nOn their 2nd collaboration from 1997, the journey continues as Steve Roach and vidnaObmana delve further into the terrain they first traversed on The Spiritual Bonding and the critically acclaimed double-cd Well of Souls.\nOn Cavern of Sirens, Roach and Obmana uncover yet another level of artistry within their shared passion for uncompromised soundworlds. The result is at once alluring and focused, fusing the duo’s continuously evolving signature of trance-percussion and rich harmonictextures that defy any sense of known location or origin. The release gathers four stirring pieces which lead to a final harmonic reflection which suggests what’s in store on their next project, already in the works.\nCavern of Sirens encompasses nearly 74 minutes of music presented in an elegant booklet featuring the organic visions of Belgian photographer Martine Verhoeven.\nStepping outside a world obsessed with categorizing every fragment ofexperience, Roach and Obmana explore subtle shades of nuance that wordscannot touch. Together, they bring to life insights and apparitions thatcan only be charted by those willing to ride the lush and treacheroussoundcurrents spiraling ever deeper through the Cavern of Sirens.\nA review from The Illinois Entertainer\nby Jeff Berkwits\nSeptember 1997\nThe best music often comes from deep within an individual’s soul, and whether a composer uses his or her creations to release personal demons or express unbridled joy, the resulting tunes work because audiences have more often than not experienced similar sentiments. Steve Roach, a pioneer in the ambient realm, and Vidna Obmana, a well-respected Belgian artist who is a more recent entrant into the space-music arena, join together on this disc to masterfully meld their collective emotions and take listeners on a dark yet decidedly delicious journey. This five-track tribal-trance album is a follow-up to an earlier collaboration titled WELL OF SOULS, and the softly subterranean nuances of that initial CD remain strongly evident on this package. The 73-minute trek commences with “Ascension for Protection,” an ephemeral work that smolders with an intoxicating mixture of synthesized effects, ethnic chanting, and a series of reverberant noises emanating from implements like didgeridoos, shells, and rainsticks. The compositions that follow twist and turn through gorgeous grottos of electronic and organic sound before ultimately reaching “The Graceful Sky,” an unambiguously ambient piece that concludes the aural adventure with a stately sense of revitalization and restoration. Through CAVERN OF SIRENS, one becomes thoroughly engulfed in the emotional and acoustical world of the artists. The excursion is hauntingly beautiful.",

            "credits": "released April 3, 2025\nStep into the InnerZone with surrealist soundsculptors Steve Roach and vidnaObmana on there their first new collaborative work since 1999′s quickly sold-out limited edition box set Ascension of Shadows. Venturing off safe and well travelled roads, the duo head into a chilling and beautifully haunting realm of shape-shifting soundscapes mixed with fascinating rhythmic forms. An unusual combination of instruments both acoustic and electronic can be heard on this compelling release. Central is the fujara, a East-European overtone flute, and the electric guitar — both creatively altered with a multitude of audio processing equipment to create a hybrid electro-acoustic mix. The final merging of surreal acoustic, electronic elements and deep “inner” rhythms creates a bold new atmospheric music experience.\ncredits",

            "credits": "released April 3, 2025\nSpirit Dome returns with a perfect companion, Live Archive. Two out-of-print releases from this acclaimed ambient duo are brought together in this value-priced 2-CD release. Living proof of the power of live performance, these recordings are so immediate and engaging it would be easy to assume they were crafted over months in the studio. Live Archive, from their 1997 tour, serves as a natural complement to 2004′s Spirit Dome, recorded live to stereo master in one take in a studio-like environment.\nSteve Roach / vidnaObmana’s 2002 CD InnerZone served as the doorway to the surreal environment explored on Spirit Dome. Recorded in one continuous 74 minute session in a hotel room in Philadelphia, this is a dark sanctuary of pure texture and beautiful, if foreboding, dissonance pulled along with pulsing beats, subtle loops and dense soundworlds.The track captures a chilling gothic ambience that offers the exploration of remote psychological states of awareness. This is achieved by way of extensive live processing of instruments including fujara (overtone flute), guitar, and the seemingly bottomless wellspring of electro-acoustic sounds found only in the soundscapes of the duo.\nLive Archive, on the other hand, collects peak performance moments of pure energy and emotion from the duo’s live adventures. The wide range of venues, traveling to various countries, and above all their first tour together fueled their mutual intentions, challenging the artists to create music that does not know the limits of jet lag, equipment failures, and physical demands which occur when leaving the sanctuary of the studio.\nThe artists write: “While our experience reached a level of spontaneous interaction in the studio, it was an entirely different dimension when performing live on stage at a specific moment in time. It was as if we were communicating with each other blindfolded, focusing entirely on the sound appearing in the moment and being exchanged back and forth while the energy of the audience and the space helped feed the process. Although we briefly discussed the structure of each concert, the magic simply came alive when we took the live performance map outside any form of logical preparation, relying on our mutual passion and instinct for traveling in the soundcurrent.”",

            "about": "The Live Story:\nWhile Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana walked different paths in the beginning of their careers (early 80s) about 10 years later they met in person in Germany during Steve's early European tour. Their instant mutual understanding led to Vidna Obmana flying over to the Timeroom Studios (Tucson, Arizona) in 1994. What followed is perhaps one of the most intense, fruitful and prolific collaborations both composers experienced and realized in their careers. Apart from recording six full collaborative albums on Projekt Records and the numerous contributions to each other's work, Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana became soul brothers and life long friends.\nTheir engagement together in the live setting became the crucible that informed all their work together. This fearless alliance for the live experience led to numerous concerts together in Europe and the US up through the early 2000's. This fueled their sound that compared to nothing at the time, and the innovations from these adventures defied the descriptives and boundaries of ambient, tribal, avant garde etc.\nEven when Dirk Serries’ Vidna Obmana project faded out and he walked different artistic paths, they remained in contact and waited patiently to unveil the archive and explore new material in the future. This live collection shows them in prime form, exposing an extreme respect for each other musically and creating music, whether based upon existing motives or pure improvisation, with pure enthusiasm, fun and on a constant edge of pushing the envelope for themselves and their audiences.\nThe life and live story continues here with this collection of four concerts….to be continued.",
            "credits": "released July 5, 2025\nAll music performed and played live in concert by Steve Roach and Vidna Obmana.\nNovember 9th, 2020 at The Old Church (Portland, USA)\nJuly 26th, 1997 at the Verucchio Festival, Arena Mura Del Fossato (Veruchio, Italy)\nJuly 30th, 1997 at Shank Hall (Milwaukee, USA)\nNovember 1st, 1996 at Theater 3-in-1 (Huizen, The Netherlands)\nComplete release is 7 hours and 28min\nEXPOSE review :\nJust one month or so after the Circles and Artifacts remaster, we have the release of The Live Story (Portland – Italy – Milwaukee – Netherlands), four complete live shows recorded between 1997 and 2000, a massive seven-and-a-half hour compilation of live material. Yes, you read that correctly! Seven and a half hours that might take the better part of a week of evenings to go through, but definitely worth it. The first concert presented is from November 9th, 2000 at The Old Church in Portland, Oregon, a show that would correspond to the Circles & Artifacts period, but it couldn’t be more different. Everything the duo creates is composed in real time with whatever instrumentation they have on hand at the time. In their respective studios in Arizona and Belgium, they have everything at their disposal, whereas in a live setting they are limited to what instruments they have on hand, and that night in Portland, hand drums, shakers, and other percussion instruments were a major part of the equation, as well as voices, the feeling is very tribal. None of the tracks have titles (simply “Portland 1,” “Portland 2” etc.) and that applies to all of the live shows in this set, and to be fair, each of the shows are pretty much a long live continuum, without any gaps. Next, we cross the Atlantic and go back in time a couple years to July 26, 1997 to Verucchio, Italy for their performance at the Verucchio festival, then a few days later for a show at Shank Hall in Milwaukee on July 30th, while the final show presented here was recorded November 1st, 1997 at Theater 3-in-1 in Huizen, The Netherlands. These final three shows in the set were all from a six-month period in ‘97 corresponding to the Cavern of Sirens period, but don’t go there for any hints as to what this sounds like — remember what I said about studio vs live and composing material in real time on the spot. Some of this material was released in the Spirit Dome – Live Archive (parts of the Verucchio festival and Shank Hall shows) by Projekt back in 2009, from an earlier release on Groove Unlimited in 2000, and the Portland show was previously released as Live in Portland 11 09 2000 in 2023. In conclusion, it’s all excellent and different from what one might expect, but it’s a lot of listening, better taken in one show at a time.",

If that is a lot or not it is not an interesting discussion. Dirk Serries started in 1984 or thereabouts, so after 40 years, there is a lot. Many of his works have been re-issued by the Polish Zoharum label, and now it’s time to compile the compilation tracks and (maybe) clear the archives, as from the 23 pieces, six are previously unreleased. I haven’t studied all Vidna Obmana releases that closely to know why Volume One started in 1990 and not in 1984 (or thereabouts) because right from the start, there were compilations with his music. One reason might be the clear musical break in 1990, separating what came before and what would come later. Vidna Obmana started as a noise band but, within a few years, turned towards more melodic music, which, after 1990, took off completely. The tracks on this set aren’t in chronological order, so it’s not easy to follow Vidna Obmana’s trajectory in music. Through the eight years covered here, there isn’t much development, and Serries is fine-tuning his approach to composing ambient music. Many of these pieces evolve around long-form sequences and loops of sound, set to trigger synthesisers and the occasional rhythm. Serries uses “various fujara’s, overtone flutes, percussion, dream pipe, recycling & abstraction mutations and voices” are added. These aren’t things one quickly hears through the extensive use of the sound effects, which may be called “atmospheres” on the cover (perhaps these are the sparsely used field recordings). There is in each of these pieces a slow, majestic flow, both pleasantly tranquil and yet with a dark undercurrent, stirring the music firmly away from the world of new age music. Close to three hours of music, this is an excellent soundtrack for short and dark (and cold) days, and it’s music exuding much-needed warmth. The reissues of Vidna Obmana seem endless, but bring it on.\nMOORS MAGAZINE REVIEW :\nDe Belgische elektronische musicus en componist Vidna Obmana gebruikte synthesizers, electronika, “outboard processing gear” en een heel arsenaal aan exotische instrumenten. Hij creëerde zo een bijzondere muzikale wereld met minimale middelen, waarin weinig lijkt te gebeuren, maar als je beter luistert juist heel veel. In 2007 hield hij er officieel mee op. Nu kwam er een driedubbele cd uit met werk uit de periode tussen 1990 en 1998, door Dirk Serries, die een duidelijke affiniteit met ambient muziek heeft, geremastered. Ik moet bekennen dat ik dit lange album niet in één keer heb kunnen beluisteren, en zelfs niet in twee of drie keer, en ik weet niet goed hoe ik dat moet uitleggen zonder dat het negatief overkomt – ik val namelijk elke keer na een kwartier in slaap. En dan droom ik heerlijk verder terwijl de muziek doorloopt. De volgende keer pak ik de draad weer op waar ik in slaap gevallen ben en zit ik meteen weer geboeid te luisteren tot ik opnieuw na een minuut of tien weer in slaap val, zelfs overdag. De kwaliteit van de muziek is er niet minder om, integendeel zou ik bijna zeggen, vroeger zette ik Zappa wel op de koptelefoon als ik niet kon slapen en viel ik halverwege Uncle Meat ook in slaap. Luister maar eens naar de paar fragmenten die ik je hier laat horen, dan kun je zelf constateren dat het hier om fascinerende muziek gaat. Als ik de vage foto zie die bij het bandcampverhaal staat, krijg ik overigens het sterke vermoeden dat Vidna Obmana een pseudoniem is van Dirk Serries, want deze donkere ambient past wel bij zijn vroege periodes. Hoe dan ook een geweldig, ingetogen album waar ik toch elke keer weer naar teruggrijp.\nVERSACRUM REVIEW :\nVidna Obmana, al secolo Dirk Serries, è una figura centrale nell’universo della musica ambient, un pioniere che ha tracciato sentieri unici attraverso la fusione di drone, minimalismo e manipolazione sonora. Con Twilight of Perception Redux: Volume One 1990-1998, ci offre una straordinaria antologia che esplora un’epoca cruciale della sua evoluzione artistica, dove il suono diventa strumento per ridefinire i limiti della percezione.\nLa compilation si compone di brani selezionati da archivi ormai introvabili, rielaborati per catturare con una chiarezza inedita la loro complessità originale. Queste composizioni sono caratterizzate da una ricchezza stratificata: droni che si evolvono lentamente, campionamenti di suoni naturali e suggestioni etniche che evocano paesaggi sonori ora intimi, ora vasti e sconfinati. Ciascuna traccia è un viaggio emotivo che riflette la tensione tra l’organico e il sintetico, tra la quiete e la trasformazione.\nAd esempio, i brani più meditativi costruiscono atmosfere di sospensione, dove il tempo sembra dilatarsi. Altri pezzi, invece, si sviluppano in modo più dinamico, grazie a tessiture complesse di riverberi, eco e campionamenti che sembrano dialogare tra loro in un linguaggio non verbale ma profondamente evocativo. La struttura di ogni traccia invita all’immersione totale, richiedendo un ascolto attento e contemplativo.\nIl processo di rimasterizzazione non è un mero intervento tecnico, ma un atto artistico: Serries ha reso ogni composizione vibrante e immersiva, rispettando al contempo l’anima delle registrazioni originali. Il suono risulta pieno e avvolgente, con una definizione che amplifica l’esperienza sonora senza alterarne l’intimità.\nUn ulteriore elemento distintivo è il design dell’edizione fisica: il digipack a otto pannelli, corredato dalle foto di Martina Verhoeven è parte integrante dell’opera. Le immagini creano un dialogo visivo con la musica, evocando gli stessi sentimenti di mistero e introspezione.\nQuesto primo volume si configura quindi come un’opera essenziale, non solo per gli estimatori di Vidna Obmana ma per chiunque sia interessato a esplorare le potenzialità emotive e narrative della musica ambient. Twilight of Perception Redux: Volume One 1990-1998 è un viaggio che ci sfida a vedere il suono come un’esperienza trascendentale, capace di espandere i confini della nostra percezione e della nostra immaginazione.\nCHAIN D.L.K. REVIEW :\nVidna Obmana’s “Twilight Of Perception Redux Volume One 1990-1998” is a treasure chest of sonic meditations, painstakingly assembled and lavishly presented by Zoharum. This 3CD compilation, released on October 31, 2024, feels like an archaeological dig into the ambient and experimental soundscapes of the early ’90s – a period when Dirk Serries (Vidna Obmana’s real name) was carving out a reputation as a master sculptor of atmospheric sound worlds. The collection gathers rare and unreleased material, much of it previously scattered across impossible-to-find samplers, obscure compilations, or lost to the fog of time. Remastered by Serries himself, the recordings are bathed in renewed clarity while retaining their timeless mystique. Encased in an eight-panel digipack featuring hauntingly evocative artwork by Martina Verhoeven, the package is as much an artifact as the music within – a tactile expression of the care and reverence this project deserves. The journey begins with “Over Rainbows”, an ethereal opener that drifts like morning mist dissipating under the sun. Layers of overtone flutes, dreampipe, and Vidna Obmana’s signature “recycling & abstract mutations” intertwine, creating a spectral hum that feels both intimate and cosmic. Tracks like “The Circulating Flight” and “Awaken In Floating Colours – Composition 5 (ending)” stretch the listener’s perception of time, their elongated drones and organic textures pulling you into states of reflection or surrender. This isn’t music for passive consumption, as it often sounds like an invitation to inhabit a parallel dimension, where sound replaces language and every sonic ripple holds an unspoken story. Take “Transcending Shadow And The Nocturnal Air”, a monumental 17-minute piece that feels like a descent into an ancient, dream-like underworld. It’s dense and hypnotic, layering overtone flutes with deep, resonant drones that evoke the sensation of floating between two planes of existence. Vidna Obmana’s work from this period is steeped in shamanic qualities, as evidenced by tracks like “Shamanistic Return”. The use of instruments like fujara and dreampipe – a Slovakian overtone flute and a hollow percussion tube, respectively – imbues the music with a ritualistic, almost primordial edge. Yet, these ancient sounds are transformed by Serries’ deft touch, merging seamlessly with the modern experimental palette of his ambient compositions. Recorded between 1990 and 1998 at the Serenity Studio in Belgium, these tracks reflect not just a geographical locus but a conceptual one: a sanctuary where sound becomes alchemy. Each piece emerges as a distinct chapter in a larger narrative about transformation, liminality, and the passage of time. Tracks like “By Abundant Rain” and “Cloud Streamers” echo with the organic hiss and warmth of analog recording, while others like “Flat Earth” delve into darker, more shadowy realms. This compilation is more than a retrospective; it’s a recontextualization of Vidna Obmana’s groundbreaking work, offering both a history lesson and a meditative experience. Fans of ambient pioneers like Brian Eno, Steve Roach, or early Projekt Records releases will find familiar ground here, but Serries’ unique ability to balance melody and abstraction ensures his music stands apart. With “Twilight Of Perception Redux Volume One”, Zoharum delivers not just a reissue but a revival – a reminder of the power of ambient music to dissolve boundaries and open new ways of listening. It’s a gift for collectors, an education for newcomers, and, most importantly, a timeless auditory journey. As you immerse yourself in these layered soundscapes, you might find yourself pondering: where does perception end and the infinite begin?\nHET SCHADUWKABINET REVIEW :\nDe Belgische klasbak Dirk Serries komt hier met enige regelmaat voorbij, maar hij grossiert dan naast releases onder zijn eigen naam ook in fijne projecten als Fear Falls Burning, The Sleep Of Reason, 3 Seconds Of Air, Terrace Of Memories en Yodok III. Toch leer ik hem voor dat alles kennen als Vidna Obmana, waar de schrijfwijze nog wel eens wil verschillen. Met dit project heeft hij geëxperimenteerd met dark ambient, drones en industrial, waaraan hij dikwijls tribale geluiden toevoegde. Hij tuigde het al op in 1984 en is gestopt in 2007. Dat heeft, met diverse samenwerkingsverbanden meegerekend, een indrukwekkende en afwisselende discografie opgeleverd van zo’n 70 albums. Los daarvan heeft hij nog twee compilaties uitgebracht en zijn er vele losse, nog niet uitgebrachte tracks. Eén van die compilaties heet Twilight Of Perception uit 1996 en twee jaar erna nog eens uitgegeven. Deze bevatte 10 niet eerder uitgegeven tracks. Soms is een compilatie wel een mooie kennismaking met een artiest. Of voor de fan, zoals nu met de herziene versie van het genoemde verzamelalbum dat nu terug is als Twilight Of Perception Redux Volume One 1990-1998. Het zijn 3 cd’s met in totaal 23 tracks, die samen drie uur en een kwartier duren. Er staan slecht 3 tracks van het oorspronkelijke album op, maar de bedoeling is dan ook dat er hierna minimaal nog eens 3 delen verschijnen. Wat voor Vidna Obmana wellicht een kleine optelsom is van wat er nog op de planken lag, exclusieve bijdragen op vroegere compilaties, labelsamplers en magazines, is voor andere artiesten gewoon een complete discografie. Maar nu dus deel één de eerste drie cd’s, waar naast die exclusieve bijdragen, die vermoedelijk niet veel mensen hebben en zeker niet compleet, ook nog eens 6 nooit eerder uitgebrachte tracks te vinden zijn. Het is allemaal muziek in de bekende en toch gevarieerde stijl van Vidna Obmana, die bepaald niet onder doet voor die van zijn reguliere albums. Dat alles is gestoken in een fraai ontworpen digipack van 8 panelen. Het is een must voor de fan en een geweldige introductie mocht je deze leren kennen.\nDP-MOTIV REVIEW :\nAlthough Dirk Serries’ ambient formation has been a thing of the past for nearly 20 years, posthumous releases from him still appear from time to time, thanks to his once heightened creativity and diligence. The ambient music universe has always been a genre that I have only superficially tolerated and liked, but VIDNA OBMANA, active since the mid-eighties, has been steadily gaining ground in it, as I have always greatly appreciated this kind of closeness to nature expressed in the language of music, especially with regard to the period marked by the nineties, when I was enchanted by a series of albums (without claiming to be exhaustive: Passage In Beauty, Echoing Delight, Ending Mirage, The Spiritual Bonding and, above all, Well Of Souls, produced with the participation of Steve Roach), which has remained an unbroken benchmark segment of my musical wanderings ever since. Thanks to the Polish label Zoharum, recordings that were once locked away in a drawer, then slightly improved in 2024, became available with this triple CD, which is not an easy listen at all, but definitely deserves the perseverance. These compositions recorded in the first half of the nineties depict the development of VIDNA OBMANA’s most beautiful period, these impressively clear ambient recordings are much more complex than we might superficially assume. Let’s not forget that at that time the technology was also less advanced than it is today, not to mention that Dirk Serries (in an extremely sympathetic way) gave far greater priority to analog synthesizers, tape manipulations, microphoned nature recordings and sound-generating devices, and instruments that would be considered exotic to the “average European ear”. In short, we are not talking about classically shaped music, but rather about creating a kind of soundscape, mood projections, and spiritual journeys that result in magical experiences, as these interwoven sound streams simultaneously guide and enchant you while listening, discovering landscapes where the untouched nature that resists the modern age is the master and everything is pure, like the flow of a pulsating stream swollen with power. These recordings are best listened to with headphones, either lying down, or at least in a comfortable armchair, in semi-darkness, free from all external, disturbing factors. It is worth taking the time, because this music is guaranteed to thank you for your attention.\nMUSIQUE MACHINE REVIEW :\nTwilight Of Perception Redux Volume One 1990-1998 is the first in a series of planned CD compilations from Poland’s Zoharum. Looking at rare, unreleased, etc recordings from euro ambient pioneer Vidna Obmana aka Belgium’s Dirk Serries. The three-CD set takes in twenty three tracks- with as you’d expect from such a collection variation in both the tone/ atmosphere of the tracks. The three-CD set comes in a eight-panel digipak- this features an effective blend of dark blue texts underlaid by what looks like close-up monochrome photos of tree bark. So as with all of the growing catalogue of Vidna Obmana reissues on Zoharum, we a get a nicely moody/ lightly arty look- which fits the music inside well. Seemingly the compilation isn’t set in a chronological manner- though we do get original release credits for each of the tracks featured. So, on disc one, we find eight tracks. These move from the slowly weaving tone glow meets lightly angular chiming’s of “Awaken In Floating Colours – Composition 2 “. Onto the gently harmonic warmings and lightly warbling drift of “The Circulating Flight”. Though to the spaced-slightly clunky piano key notation and moody pitch swirling’s of “Awaken In Floating Colours – Composition 5 (ending)”.\nDisc two features nine tracks. We move from gently warbling, circling, and rising ambience of “Twilight Came”. Onto eerily baying “Torch Of Remembrance” with its mix of distant brood and light horn like hissing tones. Though to the slurred and forlorn string like ebb & low key ritual ambience unease of “Flat Earth”.\nFinally on disc three we find six tracks. These open with the steady string like simmer meets suck in amber nostalgic synth tone dwell of “Deep Within”. There’s the distant hissing chatter ‘n’ knock, gliding glow, and faint female choral voices of “Approaching The Glaze”. Or “Transcending Shadow And The Nocturnal Air” with it’s dense-yet- soothing mix of cascading upwards tone, warming tone shift, and distant harmonic glint.\nIt’s always great to see new Vidna Obmana reissues on Zoharum. And with this release there are many new- to-me/ unheard tracks to enjoy. Here’s looking forward to the next in this series.\nGONZO CIRCUS REVIEW :\nOpmerkelijk. Zelfs na al die jaren blijft de naam Vidna Obmana in toegewijde internationale kringen waar atmosferische ambient gekoesterd wordt tot de verbeelding spreken. Nochtans droeg Dirk Serries dit lang meedraaiende (1984), succesvolle en invloedrijke project in 2007 definitief ten gave. Maar kijk: anno 2025 kruipt het fanbloed nog steeds waar het niet kan kruipen kan. Het Poolse Zoharum is al een tijdje geleden begonnen om klassieke albums zoals ‘Revealed By Composed Nature’ (1990), ‘The River Of Appearance’ (1996) of ‘Crossing The Trail’ (1998) opnieuw uit te geven, telkens gemasterd en al dan niet met flink wat bonusmateriaal. Het eerste volume van de ‘Twilight Of Perception Redux’ serie, die in totaal uit minstens vier maal drie cd’ zal bestaan, graait niet louder lukraak in het rijke oeuvre van Vidna Obmana, maar diept zeldzaam, nooit uitgebracht of puur obscuur materiaal op dat her en der te vinden was op compilaties of samplers. Er werd daarbij ook nagedacht over de sequentie van de nummers. Niet onbelangrijk, zo blijkt. Het resultaat, zoals valt te verwachten bij Serries, is een lange sonische trip naar een andere dimensie tussen tijd en ruimte. Naar een plaats tussen de oren waar grenzen tussen bewust en onbewust vervagen, waar heden en verleden symbiotisch versmelten, en waar dromen tastbaar worden. ‘Twilight Of Perception Redux Volume One 1990-1998’ bevat kortom geen seconde luie restjes, maar essentieel materiaal voor de fans van ’s mans meest tot de verbeelding sprekende soundscapes.\nSIDE-LINE REVIEW :\nThe Belgian solo project Vidna Obmana, led by Dirk Serries, has been on hiatus for several years, yet a steady stream of releases continues to see the light of day. These are mostly reissues or live recordings, but “Twilight Of Perception” stands out as a special compilation. It brings together no fewer than 23 tracks—an impressive collection of pieces originally released on small and now-forgotten compilations, along with several previously unreleased works. The compilation forms a surprisingly coherent whole, offering listeners the chance to (re)discover the distinctive, Experimental, and deeply Cinematic style of the artist. Most tracks have a floating, ambient character that recalls the work of ambient pioneers. As you delve deeper into the tracklist, however, you’ll also encounter darker and more ominous compositions. Vidna Obmana’s music remains enigmatic, yet meticulously crafted. Subtle piano arrangements weave through the album, and at times, flute passages emerge, inviting us on a journey through time and memory. You’ll also notice percussion parts running through some cuts. This release is an absolute must-have for fans of this singular artist. (Rating:7½).\nONLYDEATHISREAL REVIEW :\nOh no, another one of Zoharum’s extensive – to the point of being excessive! – ambient anthologies! This was my first thought upon getting my hands on this 3 CD compilation, with the Polish label’s recent Rapoon 3 CD compilation Dream Circle (In Three Phases) in fresh memory. And while there are similarities in the nature of the releases, musically the two are quite different. And as such, my assessment of them. Twilight Of Perception Redux shares the name with an older compilation from the mid-90’s. However, I think it is best to think of these two as entirely different releases: they share less than half of the original’s tracks, which means about 1/6th of this compilation’s tracks. But, like that one, this is a deep dive into the archives of the Dutch project, compiling together rare and hard to find compilation tracks and such. Apparently it is also the first installment in a series that is meant to expand to at least four volumes. Vidna Obmana’s style is an almost cosmic, harmonious and peaceful take on ambient. Slow, long, drawn out layers of understated synthesizers dominate here. The music is not so much about composition as it is about movement; of slowly shifting, undulating and transforming layers of soothing, beautiful and ever-so-slightly mystic ambience. Subtle details such as buried percussive elements, piano or harmonious supporting layers bring depth to the compositions, but never make the music crowded or demanding.\nThis is the kind of music you can put on for relaxing, meditation or other activities, and it will beautifully keep you grounded. However, especially at this length, listening to Twilight Of Perception Redux in one sitting is some kind of madness. I’m fairly sure I at least couldn’t withstand the entire thing in one helping.\nBut of course, the release being a three CD thing, there’s no need to do that. It’s easy to listen to one CD per listening session. With each CD clocking in at about one hour, they’re quite heavy in their own right as well, but not too.\nTo reiterate, I admit I approached this CD with quite some trepidation. Or worse: I was fairly sure this would be an ordeal to sit through. I was surprised to find it wasn’t; quite the contrary in fact. I quite enjoy listening to Vidna Obmana’s understated if not exactly minimalist compositions of ethereal, cosmic ambience. I may splice the whole into smaller bits, but I enjoy those bits unreservedly.\nMy only grievance is that there are lengthy silences between some of the tracks – we’re talking five to ten seconds. This sounds like a quibble, but in music like this, such needless interruptions to a seamless, constantly streaming audial journey have a disproportionately large impact. They really bother me. Apart from that, Twilight Of Perception Redux is a beautiful piece of ambient music in its own right, and another worthy archival project by the fine people at Zoharum. Definitely holds a wider appeal than just for Vidna Obmana fans.",

I’ve known Dirk Serries, also known as Vidna Obmana, since the first day he started as a short-lived noise project, and now, 40 years later, he surprises me with yet another triple CD of music, comprising 16 long pieces recorded from 1995 to 2002; only four of these have been released, three on compilation CDs and one on a very limited 7″. I heard one of these four, so, for all I know, all the stuff I never heard before. By the mid-1990s, Serries had a clear vision of what Vidna Obmana should sound like, utilising “Atmospheres, various flutes, overtone flutes, percussion, rhythm programming, dreampipes, recycling, and abstract mutations, as well as voices,” and expanding on these ideas. Massive, sustaining ambient pieces, long flowing paths, lots of sound effects, processing those acoustic sounds. Sometimes there’s a bit of tribalist rhythm, nothing too much in your face, except for the first part of ‘Recoils In Anger I & II”, which is something of a distraction, but working very well as a counterpart for the rest of the album. The use of voice in ‘Shaking The Surreal’ is something I haven’t heard before in Vidna Obmana’s music, but maybe I simply forgot. Otherwise, it is a very coherent collection of very typical Vidna Obmana pieces. I am wondering why they have not been released. They are as good as any from that time, and I can imagine a well-known name like Vidna Obmana being swamped with requests for a compilation track in those years (the compilation as the starting point for any new label). After three solid hours of musical head spacing, that’s one question I had, the other being: how deep are these vaults? What’s more to come? How many more 3CD sets can we expect – you may not find the answer in Vital Weekly, as Vidna Obmana outlives us.\nDE SUBJECTIVISTEN REVIEW :\nInmiddels is het geweldige Poolse Zoharum label ook begonnen aan imponerend vierluik rondom de Vidna Obmana compilatie Twilight Of Perception (1996), die 10 niet eerder uitgegeven tracks bevatte en geen gewoon overzichtswerk was. Toch bood het een mooie instap in de wereld van Vidna Obmana, die op toonaangevende wijze de wereld van dark ambient, al dan niet met drones, industrial en tribale geluiden, vorm heeft gegeven. Begin dit jaar verscheen deel één van al en kreeg je in totaal 3 cd’s met in totaal 23 tracks, die samen drie uur en een kwartier duren. Er stonden slechts 3 tracks van het oorspronkelijke album op, de rest was afkomstig van wat er nog op de planken lag, exclusieve bijdragen op vroegere compilaties, labelsamplers en magazines. Bepaald geen kliekjes, alhoewel kliekjes ook meestal prima zijn. Datzelfde geldt voor het tweede deel Twilight Of Perception Redux Volume Two 1995-2002, dat wederom 3 cd’s telt met in totaal 16 tracks van bij elkaar dik drie uur lang. Slechts 1 track komt van de oorspronkelijke compilatie en nog 3 andere tracks hebben eerder op andere compilaties gestaan. De rest is nog nooit eerder uitgebracht. Het is bijna niet te geloven hoeveel hij nog heeft liggen en van hetzelfde hoge niveau als zijn reguliere albums. Hij laat hier weer fantastische atmosferische ambient horen, die hij middels elektronica, (boventoon) fluiten, percussie, ritmische programmering, dreampipe, gerecyclede en abstracte geluiden en zang tot stand heeft gebracht. Met dit vierluik brengt hij gewoon al meer uit dan de gemiddelde muzikant uitbrengt. Het is een must voor de fans en wederom een prima instapwerk om deze legendarische muzikant te leren kennen.\nVER SACRUM REVIEW :\nTwilight of Perception Redux Volume Two è molto più di una semplice ristampa o di un’operazione d’archivio: è una cartografia sonora del sottosuolo creativo di Dirk Serries, meglio conosciuto sotto lo pseudonimo di Vidna Obmana, uno dei nomi più enigmatici e coerenti dell’ambient europeo. Con questa seconda parte del progetto Redux, dedicata al periodo 1995–2002, l’ascoltatore viene invitato a esplorare una fase di transizione e consolidamento dell’estetica obmaniana, in un periodo in cui l’artista belga si muoveva tra minimalismo atmosferico, tribalismo meditativo e sperimentazione elettroacustica. Il lavoro di raccolta e sistematizzazione operato da Serries qui assume i tratti di una vera e propria curatela filologica. I brani, originariamente sparsi in compilation oggi introvabili, singoli a tiratura limitata o pubblicazioni su formati minori, vengono qui riuniti con ordine e rispetto cronologico, accompagnati da un’attenta rimasterizzazione e, soprattutto, da un commento personale dell’artista, che offre uno sguardo intimo sulla genesi e l’intento originario di ogni traccia. Non si tratta, però, di un’antologia fredda o museale: Twilight of Perception Redux Volume Two è un oggetto vivo, profondamente narrativo, che restituisce l’evoluzione di un linguaggio sonoro ormai pienamente maturo. La raccolta comprende tre CD – ciascuno con una propria micro-identità pur restando legato all’insieme – e funziona tanto come compendio quanto come supplemento alla discografia ufficiale di Vidna Obmana. Si ritrovano in questi lavori rari le linee guida di quegli anni: il lento e meditativo sviluppo delle texture, la predilezione per i suoni naturali (flauti, percussioni trattate, field recordings), il dialogo tra drone music e ambient rituale. Molte tracce portano con sé la forza di un tempo sospeso, in cui l’ascolto diventa quasi un atto contemplativo. Altre, più rarefatte e sperimentali, documentano la curiosità esplorativa di Serries verso la manipolazione del suono, la spazializzazione, la disintegrazione ritmica. Il tutto è confezionato in un digipack a otto pannelli, con un’elegante veste grafica curata attraverso le fotografie di Martina Verhoeven, la cui estetica sobria e meditativa si sposa perfettamente con l’universo sonoro del musicista. La scelta grafica non è casuale: la fotografia agisce come estensione visiva dell’immersione uditiva, suggerendo paesaggi interiori e tempi dilatati. Twilight of Perception Redux Volume Two si rivolge tanto agli appassionati di lunga data quanto ai nuovi ascoltatori desiderosi di esplorare la produzione storica di un artista che ha fatto scuola nel campo dell’ambient. È un’occasione rara per riscoprire materiali altrimenti perduti, e per comprendere – attraverso queste tessere sonore – l’evoluzione silenziosa ma inarrestabile del linguaggio di Vidna Obmana. Questa raccolta non è solo un atto di recupero: è un rituale di memoria sonora, che celebra l’importanza del dettaglio, del tempo lungo, del suono come esperienza totalizzante. Un’opera che ci ricorda quanto, nella musica ambient, anche il silenzio tra le note possa essere pieno di significato. Consigliato chi ama Brian Eno, Steve Roach, Robert Rich e i territori più meditativi della musica elettronica sperimentale. Un ascolto obbligato per i cultori della deep ambient e per chi cerca nella musica un luogo da abitare.\nKRAUTNICK REVIEW :\nAls Vidna Obmana – oder hier: vidnaObmana – geht Dirk Serries andere Wege als auf seinen aktuellen Solo-Alben: Diesen Ambient generiert der Antwerpener nämlich nicht allein mit der Gitarre, sondern allein mit einer Vielzahl anderer Instrumente, zudem lässt er es zu, seine himmlischen Soundscapes auch mal von leichten Rhythmen zu begleiten. Dieser zweite Teil der „Twilight Of Perception Redux“-Reihe weicht vom ersten dadurch ab, dass drei Viertel der 16 auf drei CDs verteilten Tracks bisher unveröffentlicht waren; beim ersten fiel die Quote weit geringer aus. Die Entstehungszeit zwischen 1995 und 2002 ist dabei beinahe unerheblich: Legt man die Alben auf, taucht man ganz im Hier und Jetzt in der Musik ab.Diese Sorte Ambient kommt zwar wie gewohnt ohne konkrete oder gar wiederholte Melodien aus, aber definitiv nicht ohne Harmonien, die Serries hier mit unterschiedlichen Mitteln erzeugt, die man wiederum beim besten Willen nicht ermitteln kann, weil er sie alle verfremdet. Aufgelistet sind in der Info: diverse Fujara genannte slowakische Hirtenflöten, Obertonflöten, Percussion, programmierte Rhythmen, ein Instrument namens Dreampipe, seine Stimme sowie recycelte und abstrahierte Mutationen. So vage wie diese Liste hält sich auch die Musik. Der Opener mit dem programmatischen Titel „The Returning Voyage“ etwa klingt nach Neoklassik, also Streichern, und die kommen hier gar nicht zum Einsatz. Hier erklingt zudem auch gleich eine Art Schlagzeug, dezent nur.\nObschon diese Sammlung in der Mitte der Neunziger erst einsetzt, erinnert „Urban Dislocation (Alt. Version)“ an zweiter Stelle mit seinen noisigen Drumsounds an die Ursprünge von Vidna Obmana. Jene Sounds begleiten zudem beklemmende Harmonien, die einiges Unwohlsein auslösen; diese spannende Sorte Musik ist auf dieser Sammlung damit abgehakt, der Rest gestaltet sich wieder entspannender. „Somersaults“ etwa ist eine fernöstliche Atemtherapie, die zunächst mit dezidiert angeschlagenen Glöckchen hypnotisiert. Ein nervöses Rascheln liegt über den wunderschönen Soundscapes von „Subliminal Storm“, und wunderschöne Soundscapes bilden auf dieser Sammlung den Großteil der Musik. „Recoils In Anger I & II“ weicht davon ab, es klingt elektronisch, nach Synthieeffekten, indes kein Bisschen nach Ärger. Das Rascheln kehrt nach der Hälfte von „Shaking The Surreal“ zurück, dafür beginnt es ungewöhnlich, nämlich mit Tribal Drums und sogar Stimme. „Towards The Haze (Siren V)“ bietet gefühlt nach Stunden ebenfalls dezente Drums, die im Verlauf leicht an den Motor-Rhythmus von „Stripped“ von Depeche Mode erinnern, inmitten dieses vertonten überirdischen Lichts.\nEbenfalls etwas aus den milden Sounds heraus ragt „The Embrace In Motion“ mit Klapper-Percussion, „The Ceremonial Storm“ hingegen ist genau das, mit Regenmacher und schamanischen Sounds. In „The Surreal Expansion I, II, III“ regnet es mittendrin, während die Musik wie Wellen schwappt; das überlange Stück endet cineastisch-überirdisch. „Path Of Distortion/The Primary Seeker“ beginnt stressiger, als es der Rest des Albums ist, mit einem modulierten rhythmisch variierten Sound zu den Soundscapes. Die zweite Hälfte wiederum bietet Sounds und Harmonien wie aus einem Horror-Score. Der Titel des letzten Stückes, „Blur“, passt zunächst, aber spooky Klopfgeräusche unterbrechen die diffusen Sounds bald.\nSerries rief Vidna Obmana – auf Serbisch, відна обмана, eine offensichtliche oder optische Täuschung – vor 40 Jahren mit dem eher im Noise zu verortenden Album „The Ultimate Sign Of Burning Death“ ins Leben, veränderte die Ausrichtung bald ins Sphärische und ließ es kaum 20 Jahre später zugunsten anderer Projekte ruhen, vornehmlich Fear Falls Burning. Gegenwärtig müht sich Serries darum, die unzählbaren Aufnahmen wieder zugänglich zu machen, daher rührt auch der Anlass für diese Compilation, die sich überdies löblicherweise bei Material aus Serries‘ Schublade bedient und die die alte „Twilight Of Perception“-Reihe fortsetzt, die sich seinerzeit bereits auf Unveröffentlichtes fixierte.\nCHAIN D.L.K. REVIEW :\n4,5 OUT OF 5 STARS ! Not all time capsules come with dust and rust. Some emerge polished, glowing, and humming softly to themselves, like they never really left. “Twilight of Perception Redux Volume Two” is just such an artifact: a sprawling, meditative excavation of Vidna Obmana’s less visible sound-world from 1995 to 2002, restored and re-presented with the care of an archivist, the ear of a composer, and the slightly haunted energy of someone who once recorded music under moonlight. This triple-disc set isn’t simply a box of forgotten tracks – it’s a sonic constellation made of outtakes, alternate versions, and long-lost compilation contributions. These are fragments that refused to stay silent, now woven into a cohesive listening experience by the hand of Dirk Serries, who not only remastered them in 2024 but curated them with the sort of attention one might reserve for dreams that once meant something important, but were never fully understood.\nListening to these tracks is less like pressing play and more like opening a portal. There are no choruses to hum here, no rhythmic high-fives. Instead, there’s immersion. Drift. Decay. A slow-breathing ambience where flutes echo like the memory of wind, percussion shuffles through the fog, and the boundaries between organic and digital blur into glimmering irrelevance. The music doesn’t demand your attention – it seduces it. Tracks like “Tapestry of Dust” stretch past the 20-minute mark, blooming like sonic mycelium beneath your skin. “Urban Dislocation (Alt. Version)” pulses with subtle unease, while “The Embrace in Motion” and “Blur” offer fleeting glimpses of melody that feel as if they’re retreating even as you approach. This is ambient music not as decoration but as infiltration – a slow, careful takeover of your inner monologue. The kind of album you don’t finish so much as emerge from, a little disoriented and vaguely grateful. What sets this release apart isn’t just the length or rarity of the material. It’s the sheer intimacy of the sound-making. Flutes (particularly the fujara and overtone varieties) intertwine with processed textures, while dreampipe drones, recycled noises, and gentle rhythmic programming breathe together like elements in a living biome. Even the titles – “The Edge of Everything”, “Path of Distortion”, “The Surreal Expansion” – suggest a kind of mystical cartography, as though these aren’t compositions but coordinates. Everything was recorded and mixed at Serenity Studio in Belgium – an appropriately named headquarters for such delicate sonic work. And while some tracks previously surfaced in obscure formats or long-deleted compilations, most appear here for the first time, freshly dusted and remarkably present.\nIt’s tempting to frame this release as a “collector’s item”, and sure, it is. But more importantly, it’s a space – a vast, slow-moving environment you can enter again and again. Like a lucid dream where gravity is optional, or a desert storm where each grain of sand is whispering something just for you.\nVidna Obmana’s work has always nudged the border between ambient and sacred. In this Redux, that spiritual undercurrent feels even more pronounced. The music doesn’t just fill a room – it transforms it into a temple of lost futures and quiet revelations.\nTwilight may be a metaphor, but here it’s also a technique – fading, layering, remembering. And perception? Well, that’s optional.\nGONZO CIRCUS REVIEW :\n‘TWILIGHT OF PERCEPTION REDUX VOLUME TWO’ compileert verder waar het eerste deel ophield.  Opnieuw drie bomvolle (180+ minuten) cd’s nooit eerder uitgebracht of moeilijk te vinden Vidna Obmana-materiaal, zorgvuldig samengebracht, geremasterd en in een niet toevallige volgorde gezet.  Serries’ majestueuze elektronische soundscapes, drones en loops – er was toen nog geen sprake van de elektrische gitaar als voornaamste instrument – worden hier verrijkt met allerlei exotische fluitinstrumenten zoals de fujara en wat (tribale) percussie links en rechts.  Het uitgesproken ritmische ‘Recoils In Anger I & II’ doorbreekt de flow en zorgt net als de stemmen in ‘Shaking The Surreal’ voor een aangename afwisseling.  Merkwaardig wat er allemaal nog aan exclusieve topkwaliteit in ’s mans kasten en schuiven ligt uit die wel heel erg productieve periodes;  Er komen trouwens nog twee delen.",

            "credits": "released April 3, 2025\nWhen the habits of logic evaporate in the trances of an unbridled sun, you begin to recognize the things your eyes prefer to hide. From American composer Roach and Belgian prodigy Obmana comes this new collaboration, articulating its own secret world, a dimension beyond the limits of classification such as “atmospheric” and “tribal-ambien” often employed to describe these artists. Well of Souls is a double CD set with each disc exploring the nuances of two very different yet interconnected perspectives — a world that simmers with meaning during the day and whispers a whole set of other insights at night. Taken together, these pieces bring to life a multi-faceted, continuously evolving portrait of those things which the eyes like to hide but the heart longs to embrace.",
