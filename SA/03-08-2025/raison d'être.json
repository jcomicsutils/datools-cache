            "about": "'A Moving Likeness of Eternity' compiles a collaboration project between the two swedish sound artists Lars \"Lach'n\" Jonsson (Ur Kaos) and Peter Andersson (raison detre). The project consists of three live performances. The performed and recorded pieces are seamlessly interwoven acoustic/electronic sounds andimprovised/composed elements. Old traditional instruments are used together with new technology. All this blends into a unique experience for the listener. Furthermore, the three pieces are philosophically and emotionally interconnected by inherent motions and movements of time, matter, and ideas as the framework for the music.",

            "about": "Is it really dead? Yes, this release marks the end of Stratvm Terror. But what an end! Massive sounds of drowning liquids, mechanized background noises, brain mangler soundscapes and harsh abrasive amplifications. Playing this loud will probably make you deaf, but what else is there to listen to after experiencing this. 'Aged Fractures and Dead Ends' is a vast collection of various archive material produced by the Stratvm Terror constellation Peter Andersson (raison d'être) and Tobias Larsson (Ocean Chief). Lost pieces, sketches, live material, cassette and compilation tracks between 1993 and 1999. 150 minutes in total and most of it has previously never been released. Comes in a 6-panel digipak with photos by Henrik Stolt.",

            "about": "The digital album is high resolution 24-bit, 96 kHz stereo master (if downloaded as Flac / Wav / Aiff).\nPress release:\nIt’s with great honour that we present the latest album by Swedish dark ambient stalwart raison d’être.\nThis time Peter Andersson scrutinizes the paths of Carl Gustav Jung's notions of archetypes and the individuation process. Just like Mise en Abyme, the previous raison d'être album from 2014, Alchymeia is diving deep down to the shadows of the unconsciousness, and back to a dawn of the true Self. Confronting the shadow within is the darkest time of despair. There seems no way forward, only down. All is blackening and decomposed. Suddenly, through an enantiodromia, the ever deepening descent into the unconscious transmogrifies and becomes gradually illuminated. The melancholia is being purified. Alchymeia is in a sense the “raison d'être” of raison d'être, a shadowy journey through our unconscious the individuation process and archetypes. This release also marks the first time a raison d'être album will be available on the vinyl format. Artwork by Nihil.\nCD (first and second edition of 500 Copies each) in 6 panel Digisleeve. 4 Tracks. Running Time 71:06\nVinyl edition of 300 Copies in Gatefold Double LP. 4 Tracks.

            "about": "The dark, atmospheric and energetic mix of choirs, strings, various FX-sounds, heavy drums and tribal sections makes this the seed for the raison d’être sound trademark that begun with the album 'Prospectus I' from 1993. Released in 1992 'Aprés Nous Le Dèluge' became the first official output from raison d'être when it went available on the Cold Meat Industry subsidiary label Sound Source.\nThere are three versions of 'Aprés Nous Le Dèluge' and now they have finally all been joined into one complete album release: the Trinity Edition. The original version released on cassette in 1992, first as a private demo tape and soon after slightly slimmed officially on the Cold Meat Industry sub label Sound Source, had many flaws in the recording quality due to bad equipment and poor skills. The remixed version from 1995 was an attempt to make things better. It was a try to recreate the whole album but the mission failed. Only about half of the tracks was possible to recreate and the second half were just the original version treated with equalisation and reverb. Also, many sounds on the remixed tracks were missing thus replaced with new sounds. In 2012 there was a new more serious attempt to recreate the whole album. The intention with the reduxed version was to recreate the energy and feeling of the original version but still making it well balanced and clear in the mix.",

            "about": "Eternal Pride Prod. presents restored, re-recorded version of \"Archimetrical Universe\" + bonus tracks from extra limited CDr boxed version of the album \"Nebulous\". New edition like DIGI-CD with new design. Space is an illusion. Peter Andersson (Raison D'etre, Stratvm Terror, Svasti-ayanam, Necrophorus) is one of the handful of finest sound manipulators in the world. Period. Archimetrical Universe showcases Peter’s dissection of the sky, a Caesarean section that births massive, geometrically perfect sonic diversions, all spheres and angles, burnished metal dreams and pristine sonic caresses that reconfigure sound into smooth surfaces. To counterbalance the exactness of the sonic development, light rhythms emerge, huge slabs of disrupting tones puncture, the scattered remnants of all of Peter’s projects utilized in the creation of the music here. Everything seems to be in perpetual motion, evolving, revolving, reinvented at the mercy of Peter’s deft hands and devious whim. The clarity of production and meticulous restructuring of the known (space, stars, planets) with the unknown (space...stars...planets...) only heightens the journey upon which he guides us, an alluring venture into the cavernous realm of space...but not a space most of us would imagine. Whether he is sonically scrubbing the architecture, or just mesmerizing us with another sound sculpture at the edge of forever, Archimetrical Universe is, quite possibly, Peter’s finest release yet, which says a lot because his sonic portfolio runneth over with intoxicating, mind-altering sound manipulations that inspire one’s imagination with conflicting emotional responses (sorrow, desolation, awe, wonder) at all times. Space is an illusion...but Peter has brought it to life. Essential.",

            "about": "The two drunken bastards from Bocksholm (Peter Andersson of raison d'être and Lina Baby Doll of Deutsch Nepal are finally back with a new album and this time they have unleashed the Beast. Any mythological idea that Boxholm has become a great peaceful Eden is from now on eternally disproved. No one is safe anymore, not even the horror of Kisa. Birath - the Beast of the forge - is back and we are all captives inside his devilish mind, at least for 60 minutes after pressing play. Enjoy with a bottle of moonshine.",

            "about": "Digging deep in the archive, N.A.F. is another early project by Peter Andersson, far from the raison d'être sound. N.A.F. existed for a short time in 1990 and one cassette was released (but only one copy was made). I guess this can be described as something like primitive EBM-characteristic music. It was performed on a synth-toy with built-in simple FM synthesis functions (Yamaha PSS-470). There are a lot of hand played elements in these tracks so there are a many playing errors. Recorded directly to a 2-channel tape deck. The last track is a kind of an ambient recording (using a cheap tape recorder with built-in mic) with me doing some stuff in the background. Enjoy if you can!",

Remaining 4 tracks are available as bonus download of the 2021 expanded edition of The Stains Of The Embodied Sacrifice.\nAs the title suggests 'Collected Works' is not an album with new material of raison d'être (Peter Andersson). It is a collection of tracks from between 1999 and 2010 that has appeared on various compilations or other external projects. Surprisingly, despite the collection fact, these tracks form together a unity like if they were material for a conceptual album and presents a memorandum of a past. Death, decay, melancholia and sadness is the common attributes and this is also beautifully rendered in the images by Martin Bladh (Irm, Skin Area) used for the artwork. His premature death masks sequence is based on different ageing faces of Peter Andersson and works as the perfect façade for this kind of sound-wise journey and exposure.\nThe Mournful Wounds (2001)\nTaken from 'Perception Multiplied... multiplicity unified', Sweden CD 2001 CMI.\nMoulding and Destruction I (2001)\nMoulding and Destruction II (2001)\nTaken from 'Heilige Feuer II', Russia CD 2002 Indiestate distribution.\nMourn Him Yet (2001)\nTaken from 'A Final Testimony', Spain 2CD 2004 Sekuencas de Culto (SdC).\nMouldering the Forlorn I (2001)\nTaken from 'X-RATED: The DARK Files', The Netherlands CD 2006 Steamin ’ Soundworks.\nMouldering the Forlorn II (2004)\nTaken from 'Flowers made of Snow', Sweden 2CD 2004 CMI.\nThe Luminous Shield\t(2008)\nTaken from 'Compilation for a Cat', Sweden Download Album 2012.\nWork of Art (1999)\nTaken from Extol from 'Mesmerized', CD 1999 Endtime Productions.\nRemix by raison d'être.

            "about": "THIS IS THE DAEMONUM STANDARD EDITION!\nDaemonum marks the 30-years anniversary of raison d'être. With Daemonum raison d'être scrutinizes the secrets of the Shadow; the Anima/Animus archetypes and the manifestation of them as a Soul image. By learning to listen for the voice of our subconscious self, we can call that voice our Daemon, our internal genius that provide guidance, we can find hidden potential within ourselves. Daemonum is the album of the daemons.\nHunting in the shadows, for the hidden and the opposite, Daemonum is another crossing, deep down to the shaded domains of the inner world. Struggling in blindness and oblivion, guidance and protectors are needed to unfold the obscure matters of our unconsciousness.",

            "about": "THIS IS THE DAEMONUM SPECIAL EDITION, INCLUDING THE BONUS ALBUM DAEMONIACUM!\nDaemonum marks the 30-years anniversary of raison d'être. With Daemonum raison d'être scrutinizes the secrets of the Shadow; the Anima/Animus archetypes and the manifestation of them as a Soul image. By learning to listen for the voice of our subconscious self, we can call that voice our Daemon, our internal genius that provide guidance, we can find hidden potential within ourselves. Daemonum is the album of the daemons.\nHunting in the shadows, for the hidden and the opposite, Daemonum is another crossing, deep down to the shaded domains of the inner world. Struggling in blindness and oblivion, guidance and protectors are needed to unfold the obscure matters of our unconsciousness.\nAnd to mark this 30th anniversary release, we’re offering an exclusive and limited special edition of Daemonum, a double CD or triple LP which includes a bonus album, \"Daemoniacum\". Think of Daemoniacum as some sort of anti-polarized version of Daemonum, as if Daemonum was haunted and possessed by a demon. As if the daemon inside is turned into a demonic creature because the host becomes obsessed by the demon. As if the Anima/Animus was intruded and molested or rejected and deformed, infecting the host, causing a different and repressed output. Daemoniacum is the album manifested by the demons.\nThe digital release now also includes the bonus track 'The Darker Shades Of Transmogrification' which is a special version of the track 'External Transmogrification' released on the 2CD/digital compilation album 'Arcanum Vol. 1 ' , released by Arcane Dirge label in early 2023.",

The live set consists of four long pieces with interchangeable sounds that has been performed live since 2019 but always changed and evolved for each year. Many of the sounds may come from various tracks from studio albums, or are newly tailored for the live set, and some sounds are created by live improvisation. All sounds are manipulated and mixed live to create a slightly unique experience for each and every performance.",

            "about": "Ever wondered how a mix of Troum and raison d’être would sound like? Here is the long awaited answer.\nFour years in the making, carefully forged between 2011 and 2014, De Aeris In Sublunaria Influxu showcases a magically crafted alchemy between these two titans of the drone and ambient realms.\nTroum navigate through cavernous, subterranean spaces where cyclical sounds reverberate towards impressive crescendos of icy noise, luminous drones and dramatic, guitar-driven ghostly melodies. Their truly unique gorgeous soundscapes shine in a perfect symbiotic movement with the Swedish dark ambient maestro Peter Andersson. Engulfed in a hauntingly beautiful kaleidoscope of grey-ish melancholia, raison d’être comfortably walks deeply into Troum’s vast territory, delivering his very own trademark of eerie tones, ominous sacral ambience and crystal clear constructions.\nAiry lush enigmatic atmospheres live together with dark breathing, reverberant transformative drones. Rich and gorgeously layered.\nMastered using the K-14 level standard, the album comes lavishly assembled in a custom, sturdy 6-panel digisleeve packaging with amazing minimal artwork by the award-winning Spanish designer Ritxi Ostáriz. Limited to 700 copies.\nAlso available as a handcrafted boxset edition (119x) that houses a set of cards and an extra disc with additional tracks.\nThe bonus tracks now also available in the digital album:\n- Interiora Terrae\n- Momentum\n- Exiliora Aeris\nVinyl version contains one of the bonus tracks: Interiora Terrae",

This rarely explored land, resonant with a shimmering radiance that is bleak, barren and mysterious, is distinguished by slivers of fantastical nuances that twinkle like crystals under the midnight sun.\nThe original CD of ’Drifting in Motion’ was released 2000 on Crowd Control Activities. This is an enhanced re-release for even more refined sound and experience of ’Drifting in Motion’. The entire album has been carefully restored, re-recorded and mixed in 2007 and has been spiced with 3 more nuances.",

All tracks re-mixed in 2007. Original paintings by Maria Gullqvist (Sweden) and Eva Verholen (Holland).\nCD released by Old Europa Café. OECD104.\nDigital release by Yantra Atmospheres. YA-2013-36.

From trancey rhythms and dreamy, sacral ambiences to occasional male/female choirs, melancholic melodies and well inserted samples. As if the imaginary past and present could touch each other, everything is involved by a majestic, unique surreal atmosphere, producing gorgeous sounds that leaves you truly mesmerized.\nThis expanded double disc redux version of 'Elemental Severance' original album, first released on Cold Meat Industry in 1995, has been carefully re-recorded and mixed in 2015 for a more enhanced and contemporary experience.

            "about": "With the sound of a bowl a journey begins through an aural landscape of imagination and mysticism. Imagine a spirit transformed into a single breath, woods that become alive through vibrations from the earth and water that electrifies nature and bends its laws. If the previous Necrophorus album Drifting in Motion was a bit icy and stiff, elínrós is a warm and animated being. Peter Andersson, also known from the Cold Meat Industry act raison d’être, has created four beautiful compositions that blends and evolves into eternal tranquillity. Included on the album is also a re-mix of The Source of Underwater Bleakness (originally released on the Last Bleak Days compilation). Experience elínrós and life will simply not be the same anymore.",

            "about": "Unveiled, the verge of the silence, the voice of the shadow; the cynosure of the psyche is trembling for the essential breath. A subliminal reborn of invisible light strikes the eyes as the underpass appears in the essence and escarps into the esoteric realm of the source of life. A subliminal summon from disappearing heart enthralls the wind of loneliness. Lost spirit leaves deep traces behind as the path is revealing. Circle within circle the lingering path transubstantiates ostensibly, into a revolving contemplation.\n'Enthralled by the Wind of Loneliness', the second CD album by raison d'être, was originally released in 1994 by Cold Meat Industry. It is now available in an exclusive Sublime edition, to celebrate its 30 year anniversary.\nTrack 1-11 (Disc 1) has been carefully re-recorded and mixed (redux 2023) to meet the contemporary standards for high quality audio.\nTrack 12-27 /(Disc 2 & 3) are the original recordings, remastered 2023.\nTrack 12-17 are taken from the demo cassette 'Spiraal' from 1994.\nTrack 20-26 are the taken from the original CD 'Enthraled By The Wind Of Lonelienes' from 1994.\nTrack 18, 19 & 27 are previously unreleased on CD.",

            "about": "Bocksholm is a peculiar project. After some years of confusion by having two persons with the name Peter Andersson, both grown up in the small industrial town called Boxholm and making industrial music on the CMI label, there was almost no choice but to collaborate with each other in a project named Bocksholm (the old spelling of Boxholm). This collaboration between raison d'être and Deutsch Nepal started in 1998 and reflects the bad childhood environment of the ironworks in Boxholm. This is their first album, originally released on CD by Tesco Organisation in 2002.",
            "credits": "released June 6, 2002\nComposed 1998-1999. Photos by Peter Andersson.\nDigital release by Yantra Atmospheres. YA-2012-32.\nSame content as CD Tesco Organisation 049.",

            "about": "With the very last Dementia demo, released on MC in 1991, the sound became a bit more mature and refined compared to the previous 'Limbus' release. Very melodic, intense and probably the most rhythmic tracks you will hear from Mr. Andersson. Almost getting too serious, so it was time to terminate the project. Original demo had six tracks and maybe a secret bonus (Choramin) or else that bonus track was only included on the master tape. Who knows. The demo were probably limited to 10x.\nDementia was a project by Peter Andersson existing only in 1991. Influences came from EBM, Synthpop, Techno and Industrial.",

            "about": "After several years of silence finally there are some new signs from Stratvm Terror, new full length album for this great Sweden power industrial duo & Raison D'Etre side project, 3rd ST album produced on OEC! Fixation is in our mind, and the world may be a cruel place just as reflected in ‘Fixation’. This album mainly contains unreleased material recorded in 1998-1999, in the vein of the earlier CD album ‘Genetic Implosion’ but way more harsh and brutal, there are also two completely new tracks recorded in 2004 showing a change in direction by combining doom metal and industrial elements in a masterful way, moreover there is a live track recorded at ‘Nursery Injection Festival’ in Stockholm 1998 ... ‘Fixation’ may damage your health but that won’t kill you, only for an hour. And maybe you have learnt something afterwards.",

            "about": "The powerful side project by Peter Andersson aka ‘raison d'etre’! 7 new studio tracks & for the first time on digital format 3 live tracks recorded in 1998 during the Nursery Injection Festival in Stockholm! The sound is getting more harsh & powerful than on the two previous cd releases. 56 minutes of great power-electronics, dark painful sounds & few filtered voices coming from a cold hell. Cover presents a selection of re-scanned & re-worked slaughterhouse bones & tooth photos.",

If you want to, it is like a dictionary. You will get all the answers that you always wondered or worried about. Who is always wearing dirty clogs? When does cheese curd look good enough to just look at? How far can Boxholm go to get the very finest scrap metal?\nBut hey, there seems to be more. Yes, there is more, who can get enough of gluttony? We put seven more tracks on this album for your delight only: A live recording from Tower Transmissions IX festival in Dresden 2024.\nAvailable as both digital download and double compact disc, which comes in a six-panel digisleeve with reverse board print on heavy cardboard.",

            "about": "This is really Peter Andersson at his darkest and sickest. Slow churning death industrial with sick topics. It is both calm and extremely heavy. It takes the listener like the wind through a latticework of thick, molten white noise, upon a clanking percussion, marching of into death, steers a panzer tank into oblivion. It is restrained, contained, insistent, deceptively sinister, the rumble of the tank crushing everything in its path.",

            "about": "Beautiful, sensitive and electrified. 'Imprints' by Necrophorus goes beyond the previous album 'elinrós' (2005) and further investigates the aural landscape of imagination and mysticism. 'Imprints' vibrates a fresh air mixed of three dimensional electrified organic field recordings and minimal immersive sequenced organ sounds thus creating the psychedelic atmosphere of virtually being inside the music, inside the magic circle of the aural landscape.\n'Imprints' is the fifth CD album from Necrophorus/Peter Andersson (Sweden) who is most known for the project raison d'être with several masterpiece releases on the Swedish legendary Cold Meat Industry label. Inspired by the impressions of his visit to the amazing landscapes of Iceland summer 2006, Peter Andersson has created a new astonishing aural output. 'Imprints' consists of three variations of the same impression: two of them are pure studio composisitons while the third variation is improvised as 'live in studio' recording.",

This is music guaranteed to at least bring about thoughts of mysticism, if it doesn't produce mystical states outright. This defines the term hauntingly beautiful. 'In Sadness, Silence And Solitude', first released in 1997, is the fourth full-length album of raison d'être and is yet another astonishing dark ambient industrial masterpiece.\n'In Sadness, Silence an Solitude' (expanded edition 2021) is an updated version of the long sold-out expanded edition from 2014. It contains the same tracks but with a fresh new K-14 level mastering presenting the highest possible sound quality.\nDigital files are available in 24-bit quality.\nCustomers who buy ’In Sadness, Silence an Solitude’ (expanded edition 2021) directly from my Bandcamp store (this webshop) will get free download tracks:\n23 In Absence Of Light (Deconstructed)\n24 The Well Of Sadness (Deconstructed)\n25 Falling Twilight (Early Sketch)\nTracks on the double vinyl edition (Cyclic Law 140thCycle / Old Europa Cafe OELP030):\nLP 1 Side A:\n1.

            "about": "It took four years. First we didn't dare to do it; to cause a moral disaster. But here we are, and we want to do it and we don't regret anything because the album has just been released. In 2014 Bocksholm performed live in the outer domains of Boxholm for the first and probably last time. Performing a mashed up 'Best of' live-set in front of native clogs audience, amongst inbreeders and the commonly disabled, in the band's own natural habitat and backyard, it couldn't be anything but success. Wine and vodka flooded like a deluge in everyones throats, black clogs were thrown on the stage from the very first second, the home-distilling machines went overheated, the women-raping-men rates hit the ceiling of the local ironworks and the ancestor Stenbock himself turned in his grave not only once but six times. Now you can experience the same, if you dare to buy the Ironic Discomfort And Cheesy Manners. Somehow this album will become a homage to the cheese manufacturing in Boxholm, that sadly will stop by the end of 2019 because of greedy owners that found a way to save money by moving the manufacturing too another town far away. After this things will never be the same in Boxholm, a huge loss of cultural identity not only for the town itself but probably also for the Bocksholm project. At least, there will still be iron. Maybe the owners will change their minds when they here this album.\nWell, sad enough, we are also happy to announce that included in this album are six selected and never before released tracks performed live in Pawtucket (US) and Poznan (Poland) as part of the World tour in 2014. These special tracks will remain live only tracks.\nThe CD album comes in a 6-panel cardboard digisleeve displaying the remains of Sweden's first electric locomotive built in Boxholm 1890. CD is limited to 306x.",

            "about": "The word Laniakea means the immeasurable heaven: deep, spacious, dark and ostensibly emtpy but still full of energy, matter, structures and bright objects. The same words can be said about the sound on the new studio album by Atomine Elektrine. Further on, the 'Laniakea' album is also characterized by molecular reactions, eroding particles, nuclear fractals, diffused lightwaves and multiversed orbits. Old fashioned modular analogue electronic synthesis combined with modern digital processing is the gravitational focal point on 'Laniakea'. The tracks have mainly sequencer driven narratives with ambient layers of both classic retro styled elements and advanced processed novel sounds.\nThe origin of the 'Laniakea' album is based on two fundamental occurrences: The definition of the galaxy supercluster Laniakea in 2014 and the decease of the Tangerine Dream mastermind Edgar Froese in 2015. 'Laniakea' is simply a homage to the vastness of space and a eulogy to the kosmische musik that appeared in the early 1970's.\nThree bonus tracks (sketches) are included on the CD version (duration 76 minutes), now also available on the Bandcamp digital album as bonus download content. CD comes in a 6-panel digipak sleeve with original art by Hypsis  (hypsis.net).\nAtomine Elektrine is a side project of Peter Andersson, most known from the dark ambient industrial project raison d'être, with thematic interest in the vast space but also in the smaller world of atoms. It is named after a nuclear power plant and is in part inspired by the electronic space music of the 70's. Peter Andersson, let out his version of this musical direction in the beginning of 1992, and since then has been expressed on a number of albums, for instance 'Archimetrical Universe' (1999), 'Nebulous' (2007) and 'The Deep Invisible' (2008).",

            "about": "With 'Limbus (revisited)' Peter Andersson goes back to the year 1991 and select the best moments from an early demo tape by his Dementia-project. The original demo contains 20 tracks, so half of them are included in this revisit. The last track became an unique bonus track copied to the master-tape alone a month later after the actual release. So the track, which was obviously not treated with care concerning the quality, was never included in the 1991 edition. The vocals of that last track is written and performed by Johanna Rosenqvist (KOEFF, Institut).\nDementia was a project by Peter Andersson existing only in 1991. Influences came from EBM, Synthpop, Techno and Industrial.",

            "about": "'Live Archive 1' contains the very first live performance of raison d’être at ‘Festival Musiques Ultimes’ in Nevers, France, 1996. The performed work was titled ‘Drop of Crystal with a thousand Eyes’, which later formed the studio album 'In Sadness, Silence and Solitude'. Also included in 'Live Archive 1' is two tracks recorded from 'Wave-Gotik-Treffen' in 2003 and 'Eurorock' in 2000.\nUpdate: please note that track 3, ´Ba-umf', was accidently sticking together with the end of track 2, but Now it is treated as a separate track, as it was supposed to be from beginning.",

            "about": "Rumoured said there will be no more albums and the project is dead. But no, that would have been too easy. Stratvm Terror had just gone underground, hiding for their next terrorising attack. Now they are back after 15 years with their new assault: 'Love me tender, or I will cause Pain'.\nThis album is filled with seven oppressive and depressive weird obscurities to ease or cause you pain, depending on your inclinations. Massive layers of corrosive darkness with occasional injections of ominous noise sounds and claustrophobic vocals makes this an utterly end-of-life experience.\nThe Swedish doom ambient industrial noise project Stratvm Terror consists of doom metal guru Tobias Larsson (Ocean Chief) and dark ambient master Peter Andersson (raison d'être). They started the band in 1993 and released a great number of albums in the late 90's and early 00's, on Old Europa Cafe, to finally take a longer break around 2008. With 'Love me tender, or I will cause Pain' the project celebrates their 30 years anniversary with no happiness, only sweet pain.",

Indeed, the first side contained a recording from the Swedish noise artist Dodsdomd. But the content of the second side, we soon discovered, was a set of Stratvm Terror tracks for a live performance at the Nursery Festival in Stockholm in 1998. This particular recording was done at the rehearsal (we only did one) some days earlier. The tracks are not unique, the studio versions has been released on different Stratvm Terror albums. The recording of the actual live performance has partly been published on the 'Genetic Implosion' CD (Old Europa café OECD 029), 'Fixation' CD (Old Europa café OECD 072) and 'Aged Fractures and Dead Ends' 2CD (Old Europa café OECD 164). Still, we thought it might be interesting to share this to the world. And after all it's free download!",

            "about": "Transformation is the key to the psyche. It unlocks the hidden domains inside us and finds the paths to inner wisdom. ’Metamorphyses’ is a journey into the deep inner self; a drama of the sublime and trancendental transformation of the psyche through a katabasis ritual presented in six transitional stages slowly moving towards completion. ’Metamorphyses’ is the key to the psyche.\nHypnotic, introspective and yet more difficult. Being the seventh full-length album from raison d’être, ’Metamorphyses’ is in many aspects different from previous works by Peter Andersson. The organic flow and the use of drones has been extended, creating a varied output of both calm/meditative and harsh/intense sound structures. The transformation in sound is also present in the perceived emotions. Demanding, tempting and deceptive are only a few elements that characterize the ordeal the listener has to withstand.\nThe expanded double CD edition of 'Metamorphyses' contains the original album remastered according to the K-14 level standard. Additionally, two previously unreleased early sketches from the 'Metamorphyses' session has been added to the first disc. The second disc contains a selection of previously unreleased live recordings from performances made between 2006-2008 in Sofia, Gent, Salzburg, Alkmaar and Budapest. Comes in a 6-panel digipak with original art by Kati Astraeir.",

            "about": "Transgredient Records is very proud to release the newest studio-work by this well known Swedish ambient industrial project, continually re-newing the dark ambient genre since 1992.'Mise en Abyme' is the first raison d'être studio album in over 4 years, following a very special \"initiation concept\" with an emphasis on the experience of sequential psychological states with cathartic effects - diving into the deepest regions of the subconscious in order to return with a fresh and \"empty\" mind. All the previously beloved elements of raison d'êtres music are here: spacious deep drones, touching sacral choirs, ritualistic sounds from gongs and bells and other awesome integrated field / object recordings - all impressively enhanced to reach a new level of masterful atmospheric composition. Moving from dramatic tension and threatening uproar to meditative beauty, this near hour long album reveals various changes and details, while always sounding monolithic (all of one piece), expressing almost unbearable sensations of melancholy, vastness and contemplation. The idea behind this album, in the words of the artist: \" 'Mise en Abyme' is an inner journey down to the most hidden and dark parts of the Self. 'Mise en Abyme' literally means 'placed into the abyss' and conceptually the album contains ingredients from 'The Divine Comedy' by Dante or any similar stories/myths around the katabasis theme. Instead of being linked to religion, history or morality, it is purely a psychological and therapeutic trip to the underworld, investigating the subconscious. But even in the darkest and chaotic places in the depths, there are small shades of light, hope and understanding; one can be enlightened and purified upon returning to the conscious world.\"",

            "about": "A strange project that for a moment united Peter Andersson (raison d'etre) and Johanna Rosenqvist (ex-Institut, Koeff) in the distant 1992. Cataclyst's music combines the melancholic beauty of early raison d'etre and Necrophorus, harsh industrial rhythms of Institut and tribal-elements of another´undeservingly forgotten project of Peter - Svasti-Ayanam... What differs this product from other works of Swedish industrial scene masters is the atmosphere of remote fairy worlds in which you smoothly sink into while listening to ‘Monuments of a Rubicund Age’. Peter and Johanna have woven an infinite labyrinth of mirages, walking through which will be a pleasant surprise for both the fans of ambient / experimental / industrial and more conservative gothic lovers. The first edition of the album was published by Peter's own label Yantra Atmospheres in 1999 and was limited to 100 copies. This reissue has been made by joint efforts of the labels Tantric Harmonies and Zhelezobeton, it contains a shorter version of the album's last piece + bonus-track. Original photographs are made by Pavel Bourchenko.",

            "about": "This may be the most obscure project by Peter Andersson. Anonyma Alkoholister first appeared in the late 90's on a tiny compilation called 'Midnight Special 4' with the track 'Funcadelic'. Then there was a long silence. In 2012 the project suddenly appeared live on the newly established festival Hulterstad Sounds in the wild forest outside Mjölby, Sweden. The Anonyma Alkoholister material are created and curated under strong influences of alcohol, and this is mostly reflected in the titles. The sounds from 2012 are really representing two worlds; both a chill-out minimal electronic style and a more harsh industrial style. Both studio versions and live versions of the 2012 tracks are included here. The early material from the 90's (track 5-9) are a bit different, though still in the electronic field. Some tryouts in genres as funk, club and dance music. I don't tell you it's good, it's just different. Not sure why I did this. Well, being drunk one does a lot of things one should regret. But here it is and it's free download!",

            "about": "This is a different experience! It's very concrete and descriptive, and in some cases almost natural, but always with some twists making it much more magic and enigmatic than just the plain sounds alone. Exhibition music can be difficult to describe because they really need to be presented and experienced in their original context. It's about sound design and soundscape composition. The key to understand the exhibition music presented here lies in the order of sounds and their combinations in layers and alterations through time. It makes the listener coming closer to the sounds, to investigate in their meanings and roles within the given frames. It's like being a sound detective.\n'Music for Film and Exhibition 3' is, as the name suggests, the third album with film and exhibition music by Peter Andersson. It contains music for various exhibitions from 2011 to 2013 and also some recently found sketches for the 'Tulpa' soundtrack, which was released in their full and final versions on the 'Music for Film and Exhibition I'. Technically 'Music for Film and Exhibition 3' is the first album by Peter Andersson which is mastered according to the so called K-level standard, specifically to K-14. The K-standard will ensure that the highest dynamical range will be preserved in the music. It will benefit the listener because the music will simply sound much greater than a hot or over-compressed album. All one need to do is to give an extra push one the amplifier volume control to match the gain of a hot mastered album.\nVideos for track 1-3 can be viewed online here:\nvideo.raison-detre.info\nThe videos are also included as bonus downloads (MP-4 format, DVD quality) if purchased from the raison detre bandcamp webshop.",

            "about": "Like baking a sweet cake or cooking an indian dish you need good ingredients and spices to get the right mouthfeel and the splendid flavor of your desire. 'Music for Film and Exhibition II' is just like that: a levelled declitre of raison d'être, a brimful tablespoon of Atomine Elektrine, a couple of teaspoons of Necrophorus and a little bit of this and little bit of that, mixed into a perfect blend of many tastes. Peter Andersson, well-known from projects like raison d'être, Stratvm Terror, Necrophorus and Atomine Elektrine, shows here broad spectrum of sonic atmospheres, like if all of his different music projects were combined into one. From ambient-drone-textures and electronic chill-out to concrete sounds to even pure atmopsheric piano tunes.\n'Music for Film and Exhibition II' is the sequel of 'Music for Film and Exhibition' (Yantra Atmospheres, 2007). While the previous output contains collected works from different exhibition projects and movies spanning from 1999-2005, this sequel is focused on one single project; an exhibition. Peter Andersson has lately worked as a media producer at Swedish Air Force Museum and being involved with their new large permanent exhibiton about the Cold War. Within this project Peter has worked with sound design and movie production in particular. The sonic results are presented on 'Music for Film and Exhibition II'. Some of the tunes are used as soundtrack for exhibition movies while the main part are sonic atmospheres and soundscapes to create the ambience of the exhibition rooms. The music is presented here as stand alone productions, displaced from its original context. To fully experience the music in its environmental raison d'être there is no other way but to travel to the Swedish Air Force Museum. Until then, you may enjoy the music on its own.",

            "about": "Peter Andersson brings Atomine Elektrine to an utterly refined and perfectionist sphere. Nebulous leaves all physical boundaries behind and takes you on a trip through endless space towards unknown deep corners of the cosmos. The sound is widening every moment and the walls of your room seem to disappear. Multi dimensional layers of sound makes this record into a cosmic outburst. A truly out-of-body, deeply layered and dynamic cosmic experience in form of a masterful ambience filled with energy outbursts, synthetic movements, illuminating pulses and algorithmical rhythms. An aural projection for a detailed exploration of nebulas, black holes, exploding stars and unknown deep corners of the cosmos.\nVery much influenced by the electronic side of the kraut scene and with the ability of imposing his very own classic trademark, Andersson sets a new stone and makes 'Nebulous', composed in 2005, one of the greatest albums related to this genre since the early 70’s. Peter allowing the ever evolving music to take shape slowly and form amidst the ever changing facades he creates. Truly an amazing achievement.\nOriginally released in 2007 'Nebulous' is now presented in an expanded version with compilation tracks, earlier bonus material, previously unreleased stuff and also a complete live set earlier only released as a digital album with the title 'Space is an Illusion - Live in Vilnius'.\nPresented in a phantom styled 6-panel digipak based on space friendly original art by Hypsis.",
            "credits": "released March 20, 2016\nAll music by Peter Andersson 2000-2011.\nK-14 level mastering 2015.\nSleeve design based on original art by Hypsis  (hypsis.net).\nPhysical release by Old Europa Café release, OECD217.\nDigital release by Yantra Atmospheres, YA-2016-86.\nTrack 1-7 taken from the original 'Nebulous' release.\nTrack 14-17 taken from 'Space is an Illusion' download album, a live recording at The Machine Started To Flow Into A Vein (Vol. 2), Propaganda Club / Vilnius / Lithuania on the 19th of november 2011.",

            "about": "The very first (and very primitive) recordings by Peter Andersson! Don't expect too much from these tracks, they are my first attempts of making music. The real titles for these tracks are lost (if there ever were any) so I simply call them Opus 1 & 2. They were composed in spring 1988 using a cheap toy keyboard (which I just got as a birthday gift from my parents) with some built-in simple FM synthesis functions. The recordings were made directly from the keyboard speakers into a mono microphone of a portable radio receiver/cassette player. The sweeping sounds and melody lines are hand played, the other sequenced sounds and beats are generated from the auto-accompaniment section of the keyboard. So in all, the recordings does lack a lot in quality, mainly regarding the frequency spectrum, which is very narrow. However, some small quality gaining procedures was made during mastering. Nevertheless, they are my first compositions and recordings and I am happy that they were saved. It's funny to read the verdict about the keyboard from vintagesynth.com: \"At the end of the day, the PSS-470 seems like a pretty advanced synth-toy, but still one that no real musician would consider using.\" I couldn't agree more.",

            "about": "Formed by aggression and pain the aptly titled CD 'Pain Implantation' is probably a good description of the music, given the focus of the approach. Sparse and suffocating atmospheres float forth while distorted sicken tones are injected. The opening track lulls the listener into a false sense of relaxation before the distorted frequencies leap out to reek havoc on the listeners cerebral area. The music throughout the disc pounds on your skull without mercy and then slows down before the next eruption, ripping through your ears jamming them with feedback and beats tearing the mind apart. Every track has a nerve grating, tympanic membrane agitating attraction, sonically careens off of the interior fortress of the body. Stratvm Terror is Peter Andersson of Raison d'être, Necrophorus, Bocksholm, Atomine Elektrine etc. and Tobias Larsson of Ocean Chief. 'Pain Implantations' were originally released in 1998 on Malignant Records as the second CD album release of the band. This rerelease from Old Europa Cafe, totally refurbished from the original master and added with two more songs, is presented with complete new artwork.",

            "about": "The World War II has ended and so will Panzar. This release is the very last from Panzar including a unique live performance from the hot summer desert war 2005 and a number of early prototypes never released before. Also included is a Panzar re-mix of the Folkstorm track ’Victory of Death’. ’Pratotypon’ contains all you need: harsh and growling electronic sounds, distorted and transformed beats, danger and blood from the battlefield. Comes in jewel case with artwork filled with early tanks. If you have a CD-player in your armoured vehicle this is the definite music to play, or why not buy a tank.",

            "about": "30 year anniversary boxset of this contemporary classic of Dark Ambient soundscapes. Originally released in 1993 on the now defunct Cold Meat Industry label, the album soon became a staple of the CMI sound and raison d’être subsequently became a household name in the genre and an inspiration to many. Offered in this massive 4 CD boxset is a completely new re-recording of the original album, made in 2022, in order to obtain the highest sound quality and mix of this 30 year old opus. Disc II contains additional unreleased session tracks, also re-recorded in 2022. Disc III gives us the original album in a remastered version and finally Disc IV offers additional session tracks from the period in their original versions.\n“Prospectus I” is a stunning blend of modern ethereal gothic sonorities and the timeless chants of monastic rituals. A refined blend of melancholy touching higher realms. Archaic layers of string instruments, bells and choirs are intertwined with percussive elements and industrial loops creating an unsettling background atmosphere whilst spleen and bittersweetness form in the foreground.\nEdition of 300 copies. 4 CDs in sleeves, housed in rigid box with lid, matt lamination. Includes a fold out 12 page booklet. 43 Tracks. Running Time; CD I 55:01, CD II 73:13, CD III 54:07, CD IV 71:12 EAN: 0679628554365.\nCo-Released with Cyclic Law.",

            "about": "First escorted and abandoned by dark spirits, you wander alone through pitch-blackness, following sounds you'd rather run from then to. But there is no other place to go but down, deeper and further. So turn off your lights AND put out your candle when you listen to this powerful release. The title says it all, 'Requiem for Abandoned Souls' is filled with such extreme talent and understanding in the ways of the desolate decay that eats away at the very structure of mankind, that the music becomes a pulsating, throbbing entity that comes sobbing out of your speakers only to lament the crumbling states of whatever you are stressed about at that moment. It’s a natural sounding catalyst that merely tries to change something inside of you. The songs are like epic collages of pain mixed with tranquillity, of course mixed with an eerie atmosphere, that goes without saying, but it’s the high quality of the material that pushes the album above the rest.\nAs with the paths previously forged, sacral and arcane religious undertones permeate all aspects of the music. Awash with reverberating drones, metallic nuisances, discordant chimes, haunting chorals and sub- orchestral movements, the forlorn atmospheres unfold over the expanse of five interlinked tracks. The key to understanding Andersson's vision for this album lies in the track titles; read separately, or taken together as a poem. The toll of a church bell escorts the listener on an existential voyage through the world according to raison d'être, a bleak place populated by shadowy souls abandoned of all hope. But don't let that scare you away, because this remarkably beautiful collection of songs is a true remedy in this age of chaos; when the outside withers away, the inside fills with emptiness, and there's nothing left to believe in.\nThe expanded edition of 'Requiem for Abandoned Souls' contains the original disc with a bonus track and a second disc with material from various live performances from 2003 and 2004. As with the original release (Cold Meat Industry 2003) the artwork consists of images of abandoned places photographed by Henk van Rensbergen, but instead of being presented with five different layouts all the original images are included in the one and only layout.",

            "about": "Lina Baby Doll [Deutsch Nepal] and Peter Andersson [Raison D'etre], two famous punks of the industrial scene, played the havoc again. In the beginning there was a very drunken gig that resulted in a very drunken album. Nevertheless, it is impossible to accuse the musicians of unprofessional recording or unusual state when recording. Since seas of beer are the most favourable condition for the records and gigs of these Swedish blokes, the concert in Malmö is simply perfect. In the meantime, well-mastered record does not leave any hints of non-studio work. Bearing in mind the reputation of these well-know masters of havoc, no wonder that this record is dominated by remarkable, powerful industrial rhythms, outbursts of psychedelic ambient, intoxicated, gargling vocals, sombre and dismal atmosphere transfused by alcoholic delirium, alcoholic despair and alcoholic hysteria that has only one culprit... No, no, it is not the alcohol, but this isolated, remote Swedish provincial town Bocksholm with its fauna and polluted nature that had such a heavy impact on the childhood of these alcohol addicts.",

            "about": "The 'Samadhi' album is in one sense very animalistic, but in another sense highly spiritual. The sound sources are mainly based on animals (dog/cat) with additional acoustic and synthetic elements. Those animal sounds may at a first glance feel raw and untamed but the layers and structures in the compositions put it rather into an opposite direction of serenity and sublimity, all embraced by an aura of ritual touch.\nThe tracks included on 'Samadhi' are not new. 'Yoga part 1' and 'Yoga part 2' were originally released on the limited 10\" vinyl picture disc 'Yoga' in 1997 (Yantra Atmospheres) and 'Spiritcatcher' was originally available on the compilation CD 'The Dark Ages - The Final Chapter' in 1998 (Arborlon Music). 'Yoga long version' is an extended and previously unreleased mix of the Yoga material from 2003 (this version is not in high fidelity; the original uncompressed master file has not been found, so an AC3 low resolution file (DVD-video sound quality) was used as source during mastering). All tracks has been re-mastered in 2013 according to the K-14 level standard. 'Samadhi' is only available as download from the raison d'être bandcamp webshop, and it's totally free.",

To make it a contest I asked my fans to use the soundmixer to create the best track and send it to me. I recieved 12 contributions and the result is presented on this album. I choosed Mix 9 by Eduardo Garbay as the winner.\nAs this is a web based soundmixer with low quality mp3 samples, don’t expect high quality sound on the tracks presented here. I have tried to disguise the low quality artefacts during the mastering of the album.\nThe soundmixer is still available online here:\nraison-detre.info/raisonmixer.html",

            "about": "'Spiraal' is the title of a demo cassette from 1994. It contains early versions intended for the CD album 'Enthraled by the Wind of Lonelienes' (cmi.27) and was originally released on my own label B.oC.a. (B.o.C.a.t-024). Some music on this demo was never used for the final release (those tracks are available on 'Collective Archives' cmi.68) but some other tracks were added to complete the 'Enthraled by the Wind of Lonelines' album. The versions of the songs on 'Spiraal' is to be seen as demo versions only and not high quality versions. The demo was recorded before going to the studio.",

            "about": "In the post-industrial universe, the name Peter Andersson needs no introduction. He is famous for his legendary RAISON D'ETRE project as well as many side projects such as Stratvm Terror, Necrophorus, Atomine Elektrine, Svasti-Ayanam etc.\nThis album consists of a collection of (demo) tracks from the pre-STRATVM TERROR project S.I.B. (Swelling Itching Brain), active in Mjölby, Sweden between 1991-1993. The band name was taken from a Devo track from 1979. S.I.B. did never release anything officially but did a number of live shows in the Mjölby region. First S.I.B played a synth-EBM mixture but later in 1993 S.I.B. embraced a more harsh style which would beceome the seed of Stratvm Terror. Some of the last S.I.B. tracks were even used for STRATVM TERROR.",

            "about": "1: This is not a new album!\n2: This does not sound like raison d'être!\n3: This is raison d'être from another time and world!\n'Tales from the Tabula Rasa' presents raison d'être in its earliest form, when there was no past and only future. This was the birth of raison d'être and the creative music mind of Peter Andersson. In one way it can be seen as the first particles to the seed that later became the established raison d'être sound in the 1990's. In the other way it can be seen as the evil twin seed that was left to die in an early stage, like if it was a stillborn or an infanticide. Nevertheless it is a period of time that can not completely be forgotten; a time when the first chapter of raison d'être was written. The music is heavily influenced by ancient myths, legends, religion, philosophy and history. The output is referred to tales rather than songs. There is a story told in each and every sequence.\nMost of the material is previously unreleased on CD but some are known from the collection album 'Reflections From the Time of Opening'. Almost all the tracks are taken from three unofficial cassette releases from 1991, the year when raison d'être was born. A small portion is even earlier,from a pre-raison d'être project called D:Combe, active between 1988-1990. All material has been reworked in 2014. To the large extent the tracks are still the same, only some very annoying sounds or parts have been removed, and mainly orchestral sound samples have been replaced with better and more expressive versions. Six tracks from the original cassettes were excluded on the CD-set since they were too irritating. The exclusion made place for the D:Combe material which has been undergoing a more cosmetic treatment through a harmonized reverb becoming more hypnotic and dronelike. The fragments presented here are from the most experimental recordings, and the normal D:Combe sound was far from this, but still very primitive. Also changed is a pair of known track titles, they have returned to their original idea of spelling.\nHowever, customers who buy 'Tales from the Tabula Rasa' from the raison d'etre bandcamp webshop will get the six missing tracks as free bonus download!\nThose bonus tracks are:\n- De L'Esprit / In the Maze\n- Eve and the Serpent\n- The Garden of Eden\n- Qi - Exalting Breathe\n- Die Âmes Horiein / The Beginning of the End Beyond the Beyond\n- Explorer [In fact this is the very first raison d'être composition]\n'Tales from the Tabula Rasa' contains 150 minutes of music (excluding bonus material) and comes in a 6-panel Digipak enriched with photos by Roman Sirotin and painting by Jennifer Gordon and Roman Sirotin.\nTrack 1-6 first appeared on the demo tape 'Music for Garrotted Mary Jane' (1991 October 19).\nTrack 8-21, 24-34 and 42-46 first appeared on the demo tape 'The Tales of Unsanctuary' (1991 July 05).\nTrack 22-23 first appeared on the tape 'Conspectus' (1994, rework of tracks from 1991).\nTrack 35-39 and 47 first appeared on the demo tape 'Suffering Death's Agony in Affliction' (1991 April 14).\nTrack 7 and 40 previously unreleased (1991).\nTrack 41 previously unreleased (1988-1990), consists of experimental fragments recorded 1988-1990 under the name D:Combe (or only Combe in its earliest form), processed in 2014.",

            "about": "NOW THE DIGITAL ALBUM INCLUDES THE BONUS TRACK FROM THE VINYL.\nA container of all the knowledge about the universe.\nThe motion of the gears deeply intertwine a link between micro- and macrocosm.\nA mechanism that simulates cosmology and senses characteristics of an eclipse, with color, size and associated winds.\nDefine a question, and there will be a calculated answer, even capable of astral divination.\nIs it an all-seeing eye, or perhaps something beyond even that;\na magic entity capable of creating the cosmic events that it is supposed to measure and foretell.\nIf so, is it by nature auspicious or ominous.\nOr is it merely a representation and extension of ourselves and our senses, trying to reach both the celestial and the intrinsically unobtainable.\nWinter-Light warmly welcomes Peter Andersson to our label, with his 'Atomine Elektrine' project and a stunning new studio album 'The Antikythera Mechanism'.\nHere we are invited or compelled even, to delve deep into the intricacies and finely tuned mechanics of this mysterious, all-encompassing machine.\nInfinitely extending it's influence across multi-dimensions of time and space, constantly calculating, cogs ever turning, gears whirring, mapping, learning, storing and moving ever onwards. Leaving in it's wake, a vast ocean of unimaginable cosmic events, left to ripple through time until they too fade away to become yet another click in the eternal cycle of 'The Antikythera Mechanism'.\nDifference between the CD/Digital and vinyl version:\n'The Antikythera Mechanism' has a small degree of randomness built-in to the sounds which means that the output of each rendering becomes slightly different. The tracks on the vinyl are of a different rendering than the tracks for the CD/Digital. This is a natural glitch in The Antikythera Mechanism and it is more or less noticeable.\nThe sounds are the same but the positions in the sounds are time offset in an arbitrary mode. Any further inequalities are due to the fact that a different mastering technique is utilised for the vinyl version, than for the CD/Digital version.\nAs well as there being a different final rendering for the vinyl version, the DLP also comes with an additional and exclusive track, which clocks in at 19:52.",

            "about": "The ambience of grim desolation: With 'The Empty Hollow Unfolds', originally released 2000 on Cold Meat Industry, the ubiquitous Peter Andersson continues his exploration of internal desolation, be it of a spiritual base or purely of self. 'The Empty Hollow' in question seems to be the soul; a soul that has unfolded into a vast, blasted industrial landscape, littered with warehouse debris that solemnly clatters like wind chimes born of refuge. The darkened shadows cast on 'The Empty Hollow Unfolds' are of an eerie, almost sinister allegiance, as if the maw at the center of infinity is yawning wide and the haled breath freezes souls; brittle souls that shatter before the immense veracity of such imposing internal devastation. Bones clang over chain-link fences. Metal creaks unsteadily. Bleak is an understatement, as the vast scope of emotions presented here is a sonic lament that lashes the soul. 'The Empty Hollow Unfolds' is a grim travelogue from the land where the sun never rises; grievous keyboard passages overlaid by factory noises and the trademark chanting monks turns this into some of the most unsettling listening since the days of Lustmord's 'Paradise Disowned'. The album was voted as the single best release in the history of Cold Meat Industry, making it an important milestone and point of reference.\n'The Empty Hollow Unfolds' (expanded edition 2021) is an updated version of the long sold-out expanded edition from 2014, now being a double CD release. Disc one contains the same tracks as the previous expanded edition. The additional disc contains session-related compilation tracks (also available on the Collected Works album) and a selection of live tracks from the special expanded edition of 'The Empty Hollow Unfolds' from 2014. All material has a fresh new K-14 level mastering presenting the highest possible sound quality. The artwork is, as the earlier editions, styled with the somber industrial photos by Martín Pels.\nDigital files are available in 24-bit quality.\nThis Bandcamp album contains six bonus tracks that was included in the Special Expanded Edition Double-CD by Retortae (elixir 7), 2014, but rejected for the 2021 expanded edition to give place for session-related compilation tracks from the Collected Works album.\nBonus tracks:\n19. The Hidden Hallows (Live Saint Petersburg 2001)\n20. The Verge of Somnolence (Live Saint Petersburg 2001)\n21. Mouldering the Forlorn I (Live Saint Petersburg 2001)\n22.

            "about": "There is a legend saying that Skogs-Sara lived in the forest called Osterskogen, she got a virgin born child named Frans Enoch. Soon after the birth three nude gay men arrived, they had followed the bright iron sign in the sky to the small Skogs-Sara lodge. These three men gave Frans Enoch the bastard one gift each; black clogs, an orange thermal Helly Hansen sweater and a box of snuff. Frans Enoch later worked as a cheese producer but on his spare time he preached that one day there will come two men named Peter Andersson and then the city of Boxholm will forever be doomed. The citizens of Boxholm did not believe Frans Enoch, so they crucified him in the forest and let him die alone. Skogs-Sara went furious and put a curse on the citizens by letting two named Peter Andersson to be born who would terrorize the citizens for all time with a project called Bocksholm. The third terror attack by Bocksholm is now here. After two successful albums on Tesco Organisation and NATO, Bocksholm now turns the the root of the problem with the album ‘The Haunting Curse of Skogs-Sara’ released by Wrotycz Records. The music is a weird and explosive experience, it is harder and stranger than ever. It is a psyhological weapon that sneak upon the victims. The citizens of Boxholm will get fucked…and so will probably you!",

            "about": "This is raison d'être alive! Put yourself in a comfortable position, light some candles in a darkened room and open a bottle of red wine of your choice. Prepare for meeting raison d'être live in your living room. Press the play button and imagine a dark place: hear a distant sound that multiplies and coming closer and closer. The sound becoming a sonic swarm that surrounds your body, penetrating your mind and makes your soul trembling in its sublime foundation. Now, inhale a massive amount of air and hold your breath for a while. Constantly repeat. Let the sonic landscapes trigger your experience. Be enlighten.\n'The Luminous Experience', recorded on the darkest hour of Midsummer night 2008 in Enschede (The Netherlands), is the first complete live album from raison d'être featuring the whole set of one concert. The live set mainly contains live only material: a mixture of composed and improvised elements that has never been experienced on CD before. Present here are also some live adapted compositions from the albums 'The Empty Hollow Unfolds' and 'Metamorphyses'.",

            "about": "This is a homage to the Atari 1040STE computer and the Noisetracker software!\nWhen I started making music with help of a computer this was my first setup and 'The Noisetracker Sessions' contains the complete collection of tracks that I made with Noisetracker. This is not the high quality music you are used to hear from Peter Andersson. The sounds used in this music is clearly low resolution 8-bit mono. At this point raison d'être existed only in theory, but just a few weeks after working with Noisetracker I bought a multi-timbral synthesizer and used Steinberg 12 software (soon replaced by Steinberg 24 Pro), and that marked the real start of raison d'être.\nDementia was a project by Peter Andersson existing only in 1991. Influences came from EBM, Synthpop, Techno and Industrial. I'm pretty sure this is very weird music for most of us. Anyhow, it is a documentation of a strange moment in the music career of Peter Andersson.\nTrack 01-02 taken from Suffering Deaths Agony In Affliction, MC 1991, B.o.C.a.t-004.\nTrack 03-08+10+23+26+28-29 taken from Subhumans, MC 1991, B.o.C.a.t-002.\nTrack 09+13-16+18+20+22+24-25+27 taken from Lost Recipes Now Recovered, MC 1991, B.o.C.a.t-009.\nRemaining tracks are previously unreleased.",
            "credits": "released December 22, 2014\nAll tracks made by Peter Andersson in 1991 using Atari 1040STE computer and Noisetracker software.\nK-14 level mastering 2014 from original 2-channel MC master tapes.\nDigital release by Yantra Atmospheres, YA-2014-79.",

Featuring material recorded in 1993/95, remixed in 1998/99 and including some tracks taken from the ‘Germinal Chamber’ tape plus an unreleased track. A massive and dangerous orgy of obscure and clinic death-industrial. Frenzied, clear and sharped sounds for an excessive journey... At last, the best release by Stratvm Terror so far!",

The project temporarily resurrected for a short while in 1994, 1997, 2000 and 2007 to make some additional material and to make re-mixes for the later re-releases. Track 1, 3, 4, 5 was also available on 'The Ring of Isvarah' raison d'être/Svasti-ayanam split-tape but with copy degradation artefacts. This release is digitalized from the original master, so the original sound before any re-mix has now been restored and is for the first time available for a greater public.",

Inexplicable mumbo jumbo electronic sounds from the heart of Boxholm. Some of you may remember the Bocksholm tune The Horror of Kisa, and yes, it's the same scary drunkard we are talking about. He had a big red nose.\nThe live version of The Red Potato Nose Suite is recorded at Hulterstad Sound, Granforsen/Boxhohlm/Sweden on August the 8th, 2015.\nEnjoy the free download!",

            "about": "For at least two centuries there has been ideas about another companion to Earth, a conception of a second moon orbiting Earth. Mankind has explored the Universe in many levels and directions, both close and very far away. We may think we should know all about the heavenly bodies next door, but it does not seem so. There has been a number of claimed moons of Earth at least since 1846 and the latest claim was done by Nasa as late as April 2016. However, no claimed object have had a stabled orbit around Earth, they have mostly been quasi-satellites, and some objects have been nothing more than merely illusions. Despite the fact Earth has no \"real\" second moon, it is fascinating that we somehow are still not sure. The subject does not only matters to scientists. The notion of a second moon is also visible in some popular culture novels, and now also to Atomine Elektrine.\nWith The Second Moon Atomine Elektrine turns closer to Earth, scrutinizing some of the stories of claimed second moons, still firmly floating around in the unknown domains of space. Organically revolving vivid layers of cosmic activities are blended with enigmatic fluctuated sequencing occasionally broken and saturated while orbiting around the Earth in the search of another satellite. Try yourself, listen and hear if you can see the second moon.\nAtomine Elektrine is a cosmic project by the Swedish Peter Andersson, most known for the dark ambient industrial project raison d'être. Atomine Elektrine has done a number of album releases since 1995, the latest one was the well-acclaimed Laniakea.\nCD release presented in a 4-panel digipak with imaginative visuals of a possible second moon.\nDigital album (Bandcamp only) includes one bonus track, 2006 RH120, previously released on 'Where Words Fail- Music Speaks - A Compilation For Ania Mehring'\nPhysical release by Old Europa Café release, OECD235.\nDigital release by Yantra Atmospheres, YA-2016-88.",

            "about": "Recorded at the God Blast America! festival in New York in September 2002, ‘The Sound of Black Cloggs’ captures the first live performance of Bocksholm, the industrial collaboration between Peter Andersson of Raison d'être and Lina Baby Doll of Deutsch Nepal. In their second full-length release, the Dionysian duo stamps out two new songs plus live versions of tracks from their well-received debut CD ‘Excursions By The Bank of the Black River’ on Tesco and the ‘Perception Multiplied, Multiplicity Unified’ compilation on Cold Meat Industry. The result is over 46 minutes of angst-filled ambience, noises, vocals and rhythms wrought from the sounds and memories of growing up in the Swedish industrial town of Boxholm and its surrounding ironworks. Mastered by Peter Andersson and comes in a digipak.",

            "about": "'The Stains of the Embodied Sacrifice' is not only vibrating on the surface of your skin. It is alive and breathing, a creature with a knife that cut deep wounds in your body while your soul shatters for air. It is a psychosomatic and transgressive disease oppressed by a compulsive behaviour manifested in dualities - the one of your body and mind - and states of metamorphoses - mind becomes flesh become wounds become fluids become stains. Play it loud if you want to become the martyr. Play it quiet if you are the innocent victim. There are no levels in-between. Violent and intense, it is a hell of an ordeal, but withstand and you are promised bliss.\n'The Stains of the Embodied Sacrifice' (expanded edition 2021) is an updated version of the long sold-out expanded edition from 2012. It contains four bonus live tracks recorded at Club Resolve, San Dona di Piave, Italy, 2011 and a fresh new K-14 level mastering presenting the highest possible sound quality.\nDigital files are available in 24-bit quality.\nThe digital album contains some additional bonus tracks (remaining tracks from the collection album Collected Works that was not added to disc 2 of the Empty Hollow Unfolds 2021 release).\n19.

            "about": "Timewaves presents moments of history in a flow of eternity. Each moment may or may not be clearly connected with each other. But when examining the past, does not every moment intertwine with some other moments, and suddenly everything is connected with everything in strange and unclear ways.\nIn Timewaves it is clear that those moments presented on the album are bound to civilisation. Is it our civilisation, or someone elses, or just a dream? We don't know. It may be even a nightmare. All we know for sure is that the clock is ticking. But ticking for what? Good times or bad times? Hope or fear?\nPeter Andersson (Sweden) is most known for the dark ambient project raison d'être and a bunch of other projects like Stravtm Terror, Atomine Elektrine and Bocksholm (a collaboration project with Deutsch Nepal). Sometimes he releases albums under his personal name, mostly music for museum exhibitions and short movies. The majority of the tracks on Timewaves has been used in various exhibitions in some Swedish museums. This time the music is a bit darker, more industrial and experimental than previous exhibition albums from Peter Andersson, but still enigmatic.\nTrack 01-04 were composed for various museum exhibitions in Sweden. 01: The Army Museum (2013), 02: The Swedish Air Force Museum (2014), 03: The Swedish Air Force Museum (2015), 04: Museum of Music and Theatre (2013). Track 05 was composed to celebrate the Work With Sounds database (2015). Track 06 were composed as a source sound for a performance by the $-kollektivet at Fylkingen, Stockholm (2005).\nCD is limited to 300x.",

            "about": "'Underneath the Spirit of Tranqulity' by Necrophorus (Peter Andersson from raison d'être) is a painted story canvas for the otherwise unreachable astral world. Adorned with esoteric ambiences, one feels as though embarking on a path of inner ascension while breathing the immaterial tranquilities. This redux version of 'Underneath the Spirit of Tranqulity' (originally released 1996) has been carefully restored, re-recorded and mixed for enhanced experience and spiced with two additional tracks. The artwork consists of drawings by Elinros Henriksdotter.",

The starting point for these live tracks is mainly the sounds used for 'In sadness, Silence and Solitude', 'Metamorphyses' and 'The Stains of the Embodied Sacrifice' looped and mixed live together with on spot improvised sounds, thus shaped into new never before heard sonically expressions.",

            "about": "OBSOLETE RELEASE. WILL SOON BE REPLACED BY Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations Sublime edition (on Runes Serpent, around May 2025).\n'Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations' takes the listener deep below the world of the ordinary into the catacombs of the subconscious, the worlds lying within us so few ever live to explore. This is music meant to stimulate the mind, to inspire one in their explorations of self and solitude. Layers of ethereal atmospheres and the collage of choirs, strings, bells and occasional voices slowly bleed together to create music for society whose spirituality has been rendered impotent. Soaking in this world, one is left with the impression of overwhelming sadness and profound desolation. This is the sound of all hope nullified.\n'Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations' is an expedition into the hidden parts of the inner self and is bridging feelings of deep melancholy to blessful joy as it seeks for the true essence of human existence. Original released in 1995 by Cold Meat Industry the album has now been restored, re-recorded and mixed to render the modern standard of sound quality still maintaining the perfect balance between subtle and harsh, dark and pure of the original mix. 'Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations' is accompanied with a second disc bringing tracks from various compilations from the period together to form a strong twin album. A unity with double joy: Wallow in the melancholy!\nThe album comes in a 6-panel digipak with awesome photos by Martín Pels.\n'Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations' has been mastered according to the K-14 level standard. The K-14 system will ensure that the highest dynamical range will be preserved in the music. It will benefit the listener because the music will simply sound much greater than a hot or over-compressed album. All one need to do is to give an extra push one the amplifier volume control to match the gain of a hot mastered album.\nCustomers who buy ''Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations' (redux version) directly from my bandcamp store (this webshop) will get four free download tracks; 'Ascent of the Blessed' (live in Erlangen 1996), 'Saifeiod' (original version from 'Death Odors II'), 'Ascent of the Blessed' (remix, from 'Angels' art performance 1999) and 'Saivo II' (original version, from 'Angels' art performance 1999). The bonus tracks are original recordings and has been re-mastered 2013.\nTracks on the double vinyl edition (Cyclic Law / Old Europa Cafe):\nLP 1 Side A:\n1. Sephiroth\n2. Ascent of the Blessed\n3. Wisdom of Withhold\n4. Euphrosyne\nLP 1 Side B:\n5. In Absence of Subsequent Ambivalence\n6. Fall of the Damned\n7. Of Dying Relics\nLP 2 Side C:\n8. Inner Depths of Sadness\n9.

            "about": "Within the Depths of Silence and Phormations (Sublime edition) marks the 30 years anniversary of the original album released in 1995 on Cold Meat Industry. The CD and digital version of the albums contains both the original recording from 1995 (remastered) and new redux versions from 2025, while the vinyl release contains the original recording from 1995 only.\nA true masterpiece of dark ambient finally resurfaces in stunning new vinyl and CD editions!\nOriginally crafted by Cold Meat Industry in 1995, Within The Depths Of Silence And Phormations is a defining work of sonic mysticism, now reborn through Rune Serpent Europa in a breathtakingly limited pressing.\nThis album is a cornerstone of the genre, an unparalleled journey through shadowy cathedrals, industrial ruins, and the vast chasms of the subconscious. From the opening moments, Peter Andersson conjures an atmosphere thick with sacred reverence and existential dread. Distant choirs echo like ghostly remnants of forgotten rituals, deep drones stretch into eternity, and mechanical whispers lurk in the periphery, weaving an intricate soundscape that feels both ancient and otherworldly. Each track is a carefully crafted meditation on silence and decay, where melancholic beauty and desolate ambiance merge into an experience that is as haunting as it is transcendental.\nThe album’s structure is impeccable, moving fluidly between solemn passages of minimalist sound design and dense, immersive sonic walls that envelop the listener. Tracks like Sephiroth and Euphrosyne feel like gateways to another dimension, drawing you deeper into Andersson’s unique vision of spiritual isolation and transformation.\nFew albums capture the very essence of dark ambient as completely as Within The Depths Of Silence And Phormations. It’s a work that demands full immersion, headphones, darkness, and an open mind. Whether you’re a longtime devotee of the genre or a newcomer seeking the perfect entry point, this is an essential, timeless masterpiece that continues to inspire and mesmerize nearly three decades after its creation.\nFrom the moment the needle drops, listeners are drawn into the abyss of Peter Andersson’s haunting world, a realm of ethereal choirs, distant industrial echoes, and cavernous drones that feel as if they were pulled from the depths of forgotten cathedrals. This isn’t just music; it’s an immersive experience, a ritual, a descent into meditative oblivion.\nFor the first time ever on vinyl, Within The Depths Of Silence And Phormations (original 1995 recording) comes in two stunning editions: 300 numbered copies on classic black vinyl , 300 on a mesmerizing gold/black marble vinyl and 400 on transparent vinyl, each housed in a lavish gatefold cover that perfectly complements the album’s somber elegance. The warmth and depth of organic sound elevate the already immersive compositions, making this a must-have for any dark ambient connoisseur.\nBut that’s not all, this reissue also brings a luxurious 3CD Sublime edition (limited to 500 numbered copies), featuring an updated mix of the complete album, additional tracks and a second mastering of the original 1995 album, offering yet another dimension to the album’s haunting soundscapes. Whether you’re a longtime devotee of raison d’être or a newcomer to Andersson’s sonic universe, this release is an essential piece of the puzzle. With only 1500 copies spread across all formats, this is an opportunity that true collectors and fans of the genre cannot afford to miss. The Sublime edition is also available as digital album.",
