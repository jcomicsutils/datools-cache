            "credits": "released December 6, 2019\nOn September 12, 2018 Sonic Youth co-founder Lee Ranaldo and guitarist extraordinaire Jean-Marc Montera joined Maurizio and Roberto Opalio in their hometown Torino, Italy, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the brothers’ visionary project My Cat Is An Alien. That evening the stage of Alfa Teatro—a liberty-style, historical theater built in 1928—hosted the live world premiere of this quartet, whose members already collaborated live and on records with each other during the years, yet never all the four together. The quartet live performance followed MCIAA’s radical aesthetic of “instantaneous composition”, where nothing is defined nor drafted prior to the act of music creation, and every sound and action is shaped around a higher-order scheme dictated by the empathy and synergy of the actual moment of enlightenment. The show was also accompanied by the projection of a brand new cinematic poetry dual film created by Roberto Opalio and previewed on the occasion, whose Super-8 film’s relentless flickering and ascending motion worked “ad hoc” to match the music and body gestures of the performance, thus enhancing its transcendental power.\nThat night Maurizio Opalio (self-made double-bodied wooden string instrument, pedal effects, bell), Roberto Opalio (wordless vocalizations, bodhran, Alientronics, electric guitar, space toys), Jean-Marc Montera (table top guitar, pedals, little gong), and Lee Ranaldo (vocals, electric guitar, bells) moved through still unexplored and unheard music territories.\nThis music is a pure ecstatic revelation, a unique, powerful and spiritual experience all of its own. Listening to this album we are offered a true epiphany as just uniquely gifted genius improvisers/composers of the past would grace our ears and souls.",

            "about": "WATCH OFFICIAL VIDEO:  youtu.be/xjt625BdodA\nAfter a 4-year hiatus, Antigravitational Records celebrates its return with a stunning new chapter in the ongoing series dedicated to My Cat Is An Alien's \"Spiritual Noise\" music and multimedia art experience in the 25th anniversary year of the Opalio brothers' project. Following the distinctive trademark of Antigravitational's serial jackets concept and design, this Red Marble Colored vinyl LP comes with a proper 24-page Art Book mounted on front cover. Made up of full-color immersive photographic details of a mix media painting by Roberto Opalio, the artbook includes QR codes to access free download & streaming of full album, the artbook in PDF format, as well as extra multimedia contents including an exclusive \"cinematic poetry film\" appositely created by the artist.\nAntigravitational is the multimedia imprint created and curated by iconoclastic instantaneous composers, musicians, performers and visual artists Maurizio and Roberto Opalio, aka My Cat Is An Alien (MCIAA), set up in collaboration with gallerist, editor and publisher Marco Contini (Galleria Contact Artecontemporanea, Edizioni Kappabit).\nFully focused on MCIAA’s \"aliencentric\" vision, Antigravitational’s main purpose is to offer the experience of the deepest immersion in the sound and visual matter of each work of intermedia art by the brothers–as duo, as soloists, as well as in collaborations with some of the most talented artists of our time.\nPursuing their ongoing fight against the digital-only fruition of concepts and contents of today, MCIAA privilege tactile mediums to fix and represent their art, aiming to survive the non-permanence over time.\n\"MCIAA PHASE THREE — WE BAPTIZE THE SPIRITUAL NOISE\" reads Roberto Opalio’s aesthetics Manifesto. Indeed, back in 2019, \"Spiritual Noise\" has opened the third decade of activity by the fraternal duo and this \"NEW VERB\" is now more than ever their \"MUSIC-ART-POETRY\" mission of life.\n\"Spiritual Noise ___ Ritual Of Spiritual Rebirth\" contains two full-side long tracks, both instantaneous compositions recorded at MCIAA's secret Alien Zone headquarters and studio up in the Western Alps during pandemics in 2021. Imbued with deep mysticism and shamanic power, the album's two pieces represent the most inexplicable and enlightening experience of psychic and physical dislocation in space-time, a proper \"antigravitational\" immersion in the mysterious sonic matter that has always distinguished My Cat Is An Alien's \"aliencentric\" universe, light years away from any musical reference whatsoever.\nIn order to enhance this extraterrestrial sensory experience, the entire record was produced by the Opalio brothers in their own multi-dimensional, full dynamics-frequency spectrum \"STEREOALIEN FIDELITY\", and the finest vinyl compound has been used for pressing.",

THURSTON MOORE, 2019 (dedication poem to My Cat Is An Alien’s “Spiritual Noise”).\n\"SPIRITUAL NOISE\" is how My Cat Is An Alien baptized their own music and intermedia work at the beginning of their third decade of activity. Volume 2 in the ‘Spiritual Noise’ ongoing series is a further step ahead in the unheard new music territories of MCIAA. Released on the new ANTIGRAVITATIONAL imprint—the record label & multimedia platform created and curated by MCIAA and set up with gallerist and publisher Marco Contini—and designed following principles of seriality and of installation art, the vinyl LP takes the shape of a multimedia object which displays a proper artbook mounted on the cover jacket, and gives access to cinematic poetry films and extra contents for a fully immersive experience.\n“After regularly immersing myself in the otherworldly vision of My Cat is an Alien for the last several years, I sometimes forget how incredibly far beyond recognizable, earthbound sounds the Opalios have traveled in their twenty years of recording. Aside from Roberto's spectral signature vocals, ‘Spiritual Noise’ feels like it could have been crafted almost entirely from haunting and mysterious transmissions picked up by the SETI institute.[..] Record store shelves are full of well-meaning bearded men wielding tablas and tamburas, hellbent on prying open my third eye or kicking down my doors of perception. Some of them have made some absolutely wonderful albums, but none have gone as far as My Cat is an Alien.” BRAINWASHED (USA)\n“ ‘Spiritual Noise’ transcends the frontiers of advanced music. Superb! ” Rate 5/5 - LOOP. CL",
