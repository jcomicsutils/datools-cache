Screwed up looking faces like they had or wear a mask All I ask is that you're open for a minute now Never long enough to grasp Like the smoke grows from my hands in a flash With each other can we last? [Chorus] The truth, it hides The truth, it hides It hides [Verse 2] Wisps of smoke caressed the mountains beneath the moon The sky fell backwards, a deep and dark green blue The gaze you cast was absent, when you were there it wasn't you A shell of who you were before the hurt inside there grew Chew down on your emotions, volcanic ruptures brew Colder as the days go by like early morning dew A different kind of blue, miles gone too soon Afflicted feelings bloom, past trauma is a tomb I can see why you might choose to blame someone else before you lose Track of who you were as the night begins to loom The air inside the room became thicker than a fool You could cut it with a knife, so it's safe to not assume The shadows of your past, they dance behind your sunken eyes Subconsciously contract, over time you say you're fine Over time you learn to cry, but anxiety made you shy Clutching to the lies you tell yourself not satisfied [Chorus] The truth It hides The truth It hides The truth It hides The truth It hides, hides The truth It hides The truth It hides The truth It hides The truth It hides",

The track’s instrumentation manages to be both raw and uncompromising yet also melodic and mystical, a juxtaposition that runs throughout Maruja’s music, serving to aid the poetry in thrusting the listener into the cacophony of emotions that the lived events created.",

            "about": "Every track we write is spawned from improvising together, a practice the 4 of us have obsessed over for the better part of a decade. Jamming is a place where we can completely let go and unleash our emotions sonically.\nA phone in the middle of the rehearsal room records every jam we do and we have finally decided to release The Vault. It is a collection of 6 of our favourite jams we recorded between 2021-2023, it is Maruja in our purest form.\nThe Vault is now available to listen to for free on YouTube but if you are in a financial position to do so, please consider purchasing it on our Bandcamp. You can own it all for £8 or more if you’re feeling generous, the support helps us massively during this transition of making Maruja full time.\nLove everyone, we hope you enjoy <3",
