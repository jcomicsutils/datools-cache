            "about": "Alex Cunningham “pas de deux” CS (WMLD-CS.108)\nOur favorite string abuser, collage wrangler and St. Louis DOBER collaborator drops a haywire ride for us all to lean back with clenched monocle and fingers stretching left and right ears a wide. Violin, Objects? / Electronics...but strings appropriating steam engine carried out at bullet train pace. A psychosis soundscape one can never quite get a real touch upon. A true spring clean. AC tossing out last year’s worn soles, a season’s memories. Paper cutter - CUTTING. Trash will hold the beat. Pup is upset. A walk of circles. A glimpse into a real world, a real ongoing life.",

            "about": "purchase vinyl here\ndigitalregress.com/collections/digital-regress-records/products/crazy-doberman\nPenumbra, from the Latin paene (almost) and umbra (shadow), refers to the partially luminescent fringe of an opaque object, like the streetlight outlining the sole of a shoe hurtling towards your eye. Hypnagogic, from the Greek hupnos (sleep) and agōgos (leading), refers to the drowsy state before sleep. Crazy Doberman here comprises 17 players from the greater Europe of the Midwest. Basement glyphs. Who’s on the lease? And what’s under the rug. The owner pays them to keep away the beast of busco. They do spontaneity, welcoming simultaneity, montaged in post. Further spool’t month to month, basking in the stroboscope. -Sam Lefebvre\ndigitalregress.bandcamp.com/album/hypnogogic-relapse-and-other-penumbral-phenomena",

            "about": "Tim Gick's already-warped patchwork editing of the entire Crazy Doberman output thus far turns increasingly glitched out across the splattered quiltwork of a nine track LP on Aguirre. Any coherent sense of time departs early on the A-side; kicked off with the familiar sound of the Dobes' synth throb and Love-cry woodwinds on top of completely fried electric guitar squiggling, all suspended in spiritual foam; then battered to bits on the greasy flat top of the record's b-side.\nRinging modular synth sirens evoke alarmingly huge Southern watersnakes swimming on top of Oconee river. Total trip zone across two sides: brownouts in the sequence of events, dubby fadeouts, and bright jump cuts in space. Teases of cartoon barrlehouse tickling on the keys of a farmhouse piano and tape melt psychedelia. The recording session in Athens, Georgia was a total \"CHUGFEST\" recalls Frank Hurricane, the Appalachian juggalo folkie king, who joined the session with the Lafayette, Indiana crew. The presence of Hurricane's own \"Life is Spiritual\" mirth bulworks the record with a muddy, barefoot hippy hopefullness, steadying the log flume through the notcturnal psychic murk toward the holy morning dew.

            "about": "A: Ragnarock\nThe derelict facilities of the old mine were scattered up the side of the mountain along path overgrown with privet and kudzu vines. The strong cool gusts of wind pushed against the structures and the empty trees crunched their branches together and whined. He picks his way through the totems of knotted pipe and wire, passing under the abandoned refinery cracking towers. The ground was held together by clumps of moss and lichen sporadically dotting the landscape below. The looming spires of the old mine poked into the early evening sky, separated by a descending sun and clouds, stacked ontop of the horizon. He looks down at the soft earth bedizened with wild flowers, their whispered smeary music floating and glowing in the breeze. He walks passed the rusted out pot metal of the storage tanks and the code painted conduit, snaking through webs of mangled scaffolding. Great pulsing chemical fires to the north turn the sky a weird orange hue, stippled with red and purple spots. The clouds transmuted into flowing mare’s tails as he approached the opening. The sinewy silver hills turn into blazing arcs of jutting hot blue ocean behind him. A chrysanthemum-like bloom of evil joy emerges in the center and the draws the atmosphere towards it, sucking.\nB: Kymulga Cavern\nConjuring the slow boil of deliberation through coordinated focus rings, he visualizes the networks of veins pumping sap. The routes of roots breathing blood. The machinery whirs around him like little wings flapping against a brutal seaborne wind. The wild dog star sinks in the cosmos and the fermented air from the cave stings his eyes. He concentrates on the kinetic tone images of the alien-god-parasite configuration and begins to feel the impulse/decay process in his spine. He thinks of the sunlight swimming down the sides of the cave, the waterfalls floating in the canopies above. The light dripping out of the internal star. He remembers walking around the empty lake, where nothing had ever submerged, and the deep interior palaces enclosed in a jungle of mycelial penumbra.",

First toes dipped in the psilocybin waters. A connection rivaling on brotherly realm. JMC & KB take the sounds and instrumentation of the eastern hills and tangle...full stumble into eventual hands down on another’s set of strings. Lost BUT NEVER. You know what rabbit hole your best friend spends his time in. You know all their moves as they turn to find them. The only way a connection and a grouping of sounds can flourish is from a relationship of this size.",

            "about": "Johnny Young presents a singular vision of beauty in his piece we lay before you today. The twin flame a singular being sliced in two and worshiped by all who have encountered such a pairing. The true blue duality of the time within blinks. You can’t have the shakes without a razor edge follow. All of life is this. You have to have the pushback, the ugliness…you gotta wonder if this might be your last breath - your last good moment. If you suffer daily could a flower birth from your fingertips? Johnny asks this…he lives this and the light at the end of the tunnel is “Twin Flame Blues” The tuning is there. Find your own reason to play the thing.",

            "about": "Upon engaging with these composite audio images rendered from the details reported, the listener becomes the 138th citizen. Left to ponder are the same questions that plagued citizens 1-137.\nNot only what was the source, but what was the source of the source? What is left to be known of mercury? And setting aside all that is obvious which can be inferred regarding size, what can we infer from this event regarding age, given the role that it played? Does age increase receptivity (and receptivity to what)? Maybe older individuals have trouble sleeping for other reasons.\nOne thing is certain - the listener ages over the image’s duration. Here lies the invitation to take this phenomenological interpretation and apply a phenomenology of mind - to take note of whether receptivity increases over the span of sound as aging naturally and concurrently occurs.\nI can report that, in my case, receptivity does increase (it is worth noting here that I have several amalgam fillings).\nIf you find that in your case receptivity does not increase, take comfort in listening as a choice, a privilege reserved for the 138th.\n-J.

            "about": "LOBA ADDRESS “Empty Prints Alone”\nA footrace on the moon / two show up armed with nothing but a polished flute and an assortment of scraping, stumbling percussion. No audience, no prize, no celebration, no start line no finish line.\n“Why race?” Say Alisha with a slight zero gravity shrug.\n“Why win?” Ludmila replies looking off into the opposite direction of the earth.\nSilence for minutes, nothing moves, no dust settles. Nothing\n“How about we set the record for the SLOWEST race across Albategnius (131 km) and record two 22 min pieces as we do it? I’ll be a stone freezer…”\n“..and a good mysterious first planetary record at that..” Lud glances around at the length of the cold canyon : arcane muppets with frayed arms start the percussion, and icy lonely flute tones stretch out to bounce back at the nearest orbiting material light years away…..\nThe results? Right here on “Will You Take No, Will You Straighten Your Jacket.”\nNow: normies with zero insight will say something smug like “Straighten your STRAIGHT Jacket” but damn, maybe they are 33% right? If straight jackets means loneliness, tighten the straps as this duo sounds akin to unobserved communication inside an island made of footprints from sullen lost tides leading to nowhere. “Music” made for no one. Given the fact that going outside to a society of shadows is less of an enticing experience as time lurches itself dectructively forward, why not have the soundtrack be the lonely sounds of your friends? At least you can somewhat understand it better. Percussionist / scrapper / stumbler / klanger Ludmila Nunes is a localized staple of the East Coast version of the Cray Dober camp via Portugal : full bio & sneaky details not entirely clear personally but closer to the island of the inzane i.e. Michigan, flutist Alisha Eversole aka Alisha Warning, well damn: lots of well known stories there. From playing to a decaying pile of “flesh” deep in the basements of Ypsilanti at 3am on a Tuesday night recording the WARNING SIGN lp circa 2006 to fighting with the Knitting Factory staff after the almighty legendary THE JASONS were the only band in the ragged No Fun Fest history to get kicked off the stage for being eeerrr … too imploding (?), to MSU sunset Rock Garden Dober dives into mystery, Alisha is the truest / realist of spirits, individual and inspiring, and always down to confuse. Together Lud and A are a perf unit of frozen atonality, and this tape could happen no other way. Smooth as sliding ghosts in ancient dust. A treasure chest filled with chimes to make your tonsils gold plated weights. A true ESCAPE ROOM where you have a time limit of 20000 years, in reverse. “Music” is a gift, this one is a disappearing ink tattoo of a wooden Dalek. Lucky you / us.\nAfter the results of the first lunar foot race are contested, soak in this beautiful rustic audio experience of “Your Jacket” into the seams of your closet indoor life and seduce the walls as they close in. No goal, no start, no finish: all old gold. Such a deep lake to dive into here, TBH I had to jam the entire “Let it Bleed” mono press LP to be brought back into real time, sounded dope right after “W.Y.T.N, W.Y.S.Y.J”\nShould have a sticker or waiver that says “This ones for the ______.” File under “Photo- copying heiroglyphs on high contrast under the light of a full moon.” Incredible slow damage here, pave your own highway and record your own version. The reality one is outdated.\nJohnny R. Spykes Fall 2021 B.C.",

            "about": "Mere Man? The least becomes the most. And look in the mirror, man. Impossible to not think of Captain Beefheart: Mirror Man. Is this the grandson? The sun the fodder the holy float. A mereman created what is not merely human.\nStarts out like an echo of the Velvets’ “European Son” bouncing back to earth from a not-so-distant satellite of the mind. Some fingerpickin’ in a Takoma Records sorta bag drifts in. But it’s a patchwork jacket—the acoustic foreground has electric lightnin’ pasted in behind. Keyboard noodle. Guitar doodle. Fade fade fade. Curl up in the warm hive for a moment. A detuned ballad without words. Indiana autumn. Don’t let my pipe malfunction.\nWalk a crooked line. Electric grin. We’re now on the second side of the tape. Progress? A silly notion in this ocean. Keep movin’. That’s the most important thing. Please don’t call it noise. This is far too pleasant for that lazy label. Think of the way your mind naturally wanders. That’s more like it. Improvisation is what a mere man does. He organizes it later. Which has been done here nicely. But this second dose of sound does have a more cohesive feel. Electric guitar buzzes into gauzy walls of sound. Bees make honey. Humans make music. Yeh, take a look in yer mere.\nMere Man = Jordan Allen. He’s been around the Indiana underground for a couple decades now. First time I remember talking to him was in 2016 at a Dow Jones & the Industrials reunion show in West Lafayette (although he later reminded me that he was the weirdo at the first Gizmos comeback in 2014 who had me autograph his faded Johnny Cougar T-shirt). He was talking about tracking down late-60s Hoosier underground documents and hipped me to the fact that there was briefly a White Panthers branch in Bloomington (and yeah, the MC5 played). The dude’s so tall that when looking up to talk, he would occasionally move slightly and let the sun suddenly blind me, so I would readjust in his shade so I could stop squinting. He played in a buncha punk/garage/whatever bands around Lafayette and Indianapolis. But the last half decade has found him in the free-music world, collaborating with Crazy Doberman and Guitars of Middlewestern U.S.A. (with John Dawson from Thee Open Sex). He also floats around the Caldwell/Tester improv crew in Indy (that’s Landon Caldwell and Mark Tester formerly of Creeping Pink and Burnt Ones). With Mere Man, he uses all his improv/free lessons and adds a heaping helping of hillbilly primitivism from the Henry Flynt school of whatsis.\nThis tape was recorded in Richmond VA over a single evening. Jordan recorded a bunch of improvisations using electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, and electric piano. Tim Gick from Crazy Doberman recorded and compiled the edits for release. It sounds real good. Feels good too. I would suggest you listen with both ears.\n—Eddie Flowers, Heavy Mother",

            "about": "FLASHES ON THE PAST PARTITION\nTongue Depressor - “never saw’m”\nAnd these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\nMark 16:17–18\nGateway - “why should not my spirit be troubled”\nBut Job answered and said, Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations. Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on. As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled? Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.\nJob 21:4\nI’ve just heard some of our neighbors think we have injected the mark of the beast as soon as we set foot into a CVS. Poison ivy grows someplace new every day in America. The sun is red. Most days our house is covered in flies. The question is: What dark lord here tests Gateway and Tongue Depressor? As Job wept among the ashes of Uz, the duos Filer & Gick + Birdsey & Rowden scrape the strings and freak the saxophones of late capital, making scrap-metal occult music both into & out of something sacred. If there is chanting, it feels like a recovery or recovering, as if voices that once held serpents had emerged from graves still green. Gateway’s side I imagined howled through a megaphone at a tent revival outside an abandoned Circuit City; Tongue Depressor grows down by the river leaking from a dishwasher, a rattlesnake-ivy covered by nematodes, growing in the shape of a satellite dish. They worry & they worship the sounds these places make.\n- Jacob Sunderlin",

            "about": "hey,\nthis entire lecture talks about a wide range of 'individual' approaches to dealing with cognitive control issues/ hypersexuality/ major depressive disorder. what i found to be an underlying theme in the lecture was that a lot of mental health professionals avoid asking patients with MDD or bipolar diagnoses about sexuality. The reason that i put 'individual' in that form is that i've always felt that if you are going to treat each patient based on different individual traits, in a lot of ways you are blurring the lines of their diagnosis. no brain is the same/ though they may share similar traits. i find it interesting how much work is put into this field and how many failures it still produces(this lecture is incredibly long).\ntalking about medication that actually works wasn't really what i was looking for in a sample from this lecture, so i chose a sample where he clearly states that medication approved by the FDA does NOT control a wide range of negative emotions accurately.\nreally i just wanted to find a clip of people talking about symptoms that i relate to on some level, and i found it. there is a lot to this topic, and it's a personal one for me. i absolutely barely scratched the surface of all that's contained in this lecture.\nim still thinking of a title ill send you one tomorrow\nthanks dude\nwww.youtube.com/watch?v=AsdEd0LX6pE&t=1492s",
