To quote the text on the cover: \"this is a work with no title. i.e. it’s not a work entitled “untitled” but a work stands on its own. once Marcel\nDuchamp said title is invisible colour. for me be with no title is using invisible canvas. of course you are free to point it by any name or pronoun, anyway. i assume there is a body that concept could returns to. where language speaks itself”. (He’s not a man to use capitals it seems) The music (fifty-four minutes) is one piece and besides that, it was \"conceived and realized in winter 2016\" there is no additional information. I checked the volume setting before hitting play, expecting some feedback, line hum, static crackles and noise but quickly had to turn up the volume quite a bit to gather what was going on here. Just what that is I am still not sure of. At first it sounded like someone being asleep (not unlike label boss Leif Elggren as already demonstrated on a previous release), recorded from very close up the mouth/nose area, but then slowly the sound shifted towards what could very well the sound of the sea, or a drawer being pushed across the floor, along with some odd short click like sound, like the slowed down ice cube in a\nglass). At one point I started to believe it was very likely all of these sound elements played together in a strange way that there is no overlap or repetition, but at the same time, it seems\nthat these sounds are pretty much the same, or maybe there are minor changes? That too was something very hard to work out about this work. Should I not have to think about it, and simply\nenjoying the music, which of course is the thing I should be doing, I thought this was a strong, compelling and strange release. I very much enjoyed the way it sounded, in all its changing minimalist conceptual approach. Every time I played I thought I heard something else, and every time I thought I heard the same thing. That probably sounds odd, and it is. But then this is a very odd release indeed. It is strange and great. Whatever it is about, or not.

            "about": "leg shaking is not an easy action.\nor better say \"non-action\" as it's about moving unconsciously and always meaning negative.\nyes it's not easy to be unconscious and negative while the body was controlled by such a social agency, i.e. the body itself.\ni mean there is no naked body left. there is only the built body.\nso does the language.\nbasically i think language is something generated by a body and through this body to its outer environment. the body is an energy transformer and an interface at same time.\ntechnically to shake leg(s) it needs no control. you can't do it by giving an order after another. it's all about automatics of a temporary system which consists muscles, nerves, ligaments, gravity, a perfect angle and a little initial power. it works like springs with sensors. and there is no room for the mind.\nsome people can't do it. drummers improved it into a musical action. that's about controlling the loose. just like writing poems.\ni have never done a workshop about writing poems. or about making \"musical\" music. i rather like to invite people to join my nonsense and loose. it's not like training a drummer. at least not a drummer of useful music.\nthey say leg shaking is a behave leads one to be useless. that close to some truth.\nbtw this is my reaction to minimalism music, which i have been deeply influenced by. but i can't and would never work with such a pure form.\nyan jun, august, 2022",

            "about": "(for purchasing lp from out of asia pls go to reading group's bandcamp page.)\nReading Group is thrilled to release Contradictions (plays 4 writers), the new LP by legendary musician and poet Yan Jun. Yan Jun has been a central figure in the (non-)music, noise, sound, and experimental performance scenes both in his native Beijing and in the global subterranean community for decades. He founded the Beijing-based experimental label Sub Jam in 2000 and has since collaborated with Lionel Marchetti, Axel Dörner, Toshimaru Nakamura, Torturing Nurse, and many more.\nOn Contradictions, Jun “plays 4 writers”––interpreting, across five pieces, the formal, conceptual, and linguistic challenges of literary and theoretical figures as constraints and guides for sound composition and experimental performance. On tracks A1 and A2, Jun “plays” Lu Xun, the early twentieth-century Chinese literary critic and associate of the League of Left-Wing Writers in the 1930s. These two iterations of “behaviors in environment” explore Lu Xun’s contradictory descriptions of sound and silence, forming two seemingly “empty” field recordings as containers for the full silence of non-intentional action. The following track, uses “acoustic mechanisms” to interpret a provocation from post-Marxist theorist Slavoj Žižek about the mechanization of sexuality and desire in expanding global capitalism, resulting in a noise sequence indexing the battery-operated commodification of eroticism. On the B-side, Jun “plays Jean Baudrillard” by exploring the “hyper-real” of audio feedback without a manual interface. The final track recalls Jun’s work for voice and speech, interpreting Samuel Beckett by reading through the Chinese translation of Beckett’s Texts for Nothing silently––except for the enunciated floating signifier 我 (I, my, me). In the extensive liner notes by the artist, he sums up this piece in language that provides a clue to the record as a whole: “How about colliding and annihilating everything through the voice of this ‘I’ then we deal with the limit of the form?”",

            "about": "(go to the label page for more release:  ujikaji.bandcamp.com)\nCreated from the non-standard use of electronics, hydrophone microphone and feedback, Crows that have no eyes is a patient and masterful 40-minute eai (electroacoustic improvisation) piece by two of Asia’s most exciting improvisers today. There is nothing close to a straightforward musical narrative here, only oblique strategies and a display of wits, curiosity and risk-taking; where the artists have opted for subtle but extreme frequencies that push against the limits of listening. This isn’t so much harsh noise as a harsh attitude – the music here is largely “quiet”, but still unsettling, as if king-of-noise Merzbow had decided to cover Morton Feldman by pricking your cochlea with a hairpin.\nThe album title comes from one of Yan Jun’s old poems. He ruminates on this image: “what if a black crow has no eyes to be aware of his blackness? what if a crow receives his blackness from the dark, the essential void? […] what if the music comes from the void we call ‘silence’?” In his desultory liner notes, Yan Jun jumps across topical affairs, from the government-sanctioned culling of crows and the regulation of live music during the Hindu Thaipusam festival in Singapore, to the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong. He notes when “protestors keep silent, making the streets a breathless whirlpool. it’s a tactic of calling out the invisible power.” For Yuen, the album takes on a much more personal meaning, a meditation on the relationship between desire and memory. The music of Crows that have no eyes is abstract and resists easy interpretation, an open work into which one could read both the political and the personal.\nThis is the debut recording of Yan Jun (China) and Yuen Chee Wai (Singapore). Yan Jun is a musician and poet, a key figure of Chinese experimental music. Yuen is a musician and artist working with sound, presently a member of avant-rock band The Observatory. Both are members of the improv group FEN, which also consists of Otomo Yoshihide (Japan) and Ryu Hankil (S. Korea).",

            "about": "Vintage Vinyl Hong Kong (VVHK010)\nThe duo of Yan Jun and Eric Wong focus on the temporal and spatial interplay of organic and digital sound. Using human voice, sine waves, and white noise as their instruments, the musicians modulate the sound sources to bring out resonance as well as to create sonic movements that blurs the borders among the sonic events.\nEric says “When I perform with Yan Jun, I swing my arm holding a Bluetooth speaker as he filters his voice by moving his head and body. I remember I did it for the first time when we played in Aarhus. I wondered how we could translate the visual representation of what we do with only stereo imaging, it turned out to be quite a different experience when listening back. The sound moves more dramatically. I try to move less when I perform these days. I let the listeners move instead, and it works for this record too. Turn your head around while listening, it changes the timbre.”\nYan says “We have another album recorded back to 2017 but hasn't yet out till now. That was\nvery quiet and obscure. And sometimes when we perform live we have body or visual presents as Eric moves his arms while I shake my head. This one is much louder to my ears and has much less to do with visuals (unless you dance while holding the folder). You can only hear this one now. Its connection is only for us. Wait... I don't think so. To my mind it's the same thing in different shapes. All connections are for everybody. Basically the artists working to build unknown and unseen connections. I think we are two of them. Are we? OK I don't really care. At least not this week. Early this week a cat jumped to a friend's record player and stayed there till the end of this album. That made me very happy. I always prefer a cat. Then later this week I will be in Chengdu, Sichuan, the spicy city. You might already know that Sichuan pepper makes 50 electric pulses per second on our tongues. I also prefer this on the ears and on minds.”\nNick says “I am thrilled to be involved in this project. It took forever even though Yan and Eric had the music ready! For that I apologise! And I am not sure how much I did anyway. I greatly miss the live experimental performances in Hong Kong’s underground venues and, reading Eric and Yan’s comments, I wish I could have witnessed the recording of this record. Play the record and move around the room as you listen - it is not for headphones. Maybe chew on some chillies too.”",

            "about": "The Tea Rockers was formed in October 2010.\nWe were playing an arts festival in Switzerland. We all got to Europe separately, everyone kind of on their individual schedules doing other gigs and things, up until the day of the first concert in Berne, where we finally met up, sound-checked, ate, took a walk, and then did our first show.\nThat was our first concert ever, although some of us had played together in duo and trio formations previously.\nThe live recording in Switzerland was released by an Israeli label. It was called “Ceremony”, although in Chinese it was Red Water Oolong, which is the name of the tea we had during the Berne concert. The tea we have determines a lot about what goes on in the music. If it’s a lighter tea, or something that gets us more animated, something relaxing, or just something that will keep you awake, it’s guiding our direction. Or something like that. Anyway, today, the two main relationships between humans and the world are eating and economic consumption. In between the tea that already exists and music that has not yet sounded, we are looking forward to see other relationships by listening intently.\nOur tea master at that time was Lao Gu.\nIn 2015, through the kind invitation of Chongqing record label Men Records, we did the rst performance and recording with our current lineup.\nUp until now, everything we’ve done has been improvised. But who knows, we might switch to composition in the future.\nUp until now we’ve had very few concerts. Like maybe one or two every other year. Hopefully our number of concerts will increase.\nSpecial thanks to our friend Lasse Marhaug in Oslo who helped us with mixing and mastering. He is perhaps one the most serious tea drinkers in the entire European Noise scene.\nSpecial thanks to our friend Yuen Chee Wai in Singapore who took the task of designing. He drinks tea without concerns of day or night.\nAnd much gratitude to Che Qianzi. One time he was saying he went up on a mountain of tea fields to live for a few months, and saw how hard the tea farmers work. It changes one’s perspective on the significance of a good tea, or a bad one.\n— Yan Jun, November 7, 2017. Translated by Li Daiguo\n茶博士成立于2010年10月。\n那是瑞士的一个艺术节。我们先后到了欧洲，各有各的活动，直到演出当天，在伯尔尼聚齐了，调音，吃饭，溜达，然后演出。\n那也是我们第一次一起演出。之前，我们有过各种二重奏、三重奏。\n现场录音后来在以色列出版了。叫做《红水乌龙》。是演出时我们喝的茶。喝什么茶，音乐就变成什么样子，清淡的，热烈的，松弛的，不想睡觉的。大致是这样一个意思。毕竟，眼下，人和世界之间最主要的两样关系，一是进食，二是消费，在已经存在的茶和尚未存在的音乐之间，我们悉听尊便，并欢迎其他的关系的发生。\n那时候的茶道师是老古。\n2015年，蒙重庆门唱片的好意，我们第一次以现在的阵容演出、录音。\n迄今为止都是即兴。下次改了作曲也说不定。\n迄今为止我们的演出很少。非常少。希望以后多起来。\n感谢奥斯陆的朋友拉瑟·马豪格为我们做后期。他可能是欧洲噪音界喝茶最多的人。\n感谢新加坡的朋友袁志伟做设计。他喝茶不分昼夜。\n感谢老车题字。关于茶，有一次，他说刚刚去茶山上住了几个月，看见茶农那么辛苦，回来以后就觉得，好茶坏茶品起来都有它自己的意思。\n——颜峻。2017年11月7日",

            "about": "FEN. Formed in the summer of 2008.\nComing from Japan, Korea, China and Singapore, four musicians, under the introduction of Otomo Yoshihide, met for the first time in Marseilles to be part of the MIMI music festival. After many hours of eating and chatting, we did some sound checks, and played an improv concert. All that while, no one of us discussed anything remotely related to music, nor deliberated about the direction with which our music performance should be taking. From then till now, the instruments we use, and our sound, individually and collectively, had changed numerous times, but still we had never discoursed nor talked about music.\nThis is our first release. And it is a live recording taken from FEN’s first and only visit to America in May 2016, under the invitation of the Japan Society (New York). The actual performance was divided into two segments – the first part of the performance, we were each spaced separately around the first and second floors of the Japan Society’s main foyer; the second part of the performance, we played in the main auditorium together. This recording is of the second part of the performance.\nIt was in FEN’s Oct 2015 Japan Tour, that Chee Wai first started including the electric guitar into his repertoire with electronics, Yan Jun simplified his setup by using just a simple feedback chain, and Otomo using just his guitar, for performance. It was also at that same period that Hankil begun using Max/MSP, by typing improvisational sentences in through his patch to create sound. This concoction of a mix between the rock/jazz dual guitars, electronics and computer noise, resulted in a form that vacillates between traditional melodies to blues chords, where “one possibly takes leads / or without leads”, became the recent iteration of FEN’s sound.\nWhen FEN was formed, Chee Wai used to process sounds he rubbed off the table through the laptop which added to a kind of serendipitous quietude of electronic sound; Yan Jun used a set of complex feedback system and at times, voice; Otomo, in addition to his guitar, had a drum set up, turntables and some electronics; Hankil used a few sets of old grandfather’s clocks, playing with their internal mechanisms. We are undeniably unsure when the next time we meet, what further changes any one of us will make.\nIn the past 10 years, FEN has on many occasions toured Asia and Europe, and also played a few times in China (in Beijing – Iberia Center for Contemporary Art and 2KOLEGAS, in Shanghai – YuYinTang and Rockbund Art Museum). We are not only musicians. We each individually curate and organise countless events and festivals, all in part to create a wider stage and acceptance for new music in Asia. We had, in the past, managed to receive countless support from friends and institutions, also exhausted a lot of our own energies writing hundreds of letters and documents just to make a concert tour – in addition to an insurmountable process of travel visa applications and possible political pressure – to come face to face with intensive tours and lurking thieves. The path is wrought with difficulties, but it invariably makes making music more meaningful. So this time, in the event of four musicians from Japan, China, Singapore and Korea, meeting in America, performing in a private institution promoting Japanese culture (which also happens to be diagonally opposite the United Nations building in New York), and eventually having a Chinese label releasing the recording, sounds interesting. Or, maybe not, but that is our reality.\nAs early as 1992, in the liner notes of Otomo’s first ever solo release “We Insist?”, he questioned if there could be a possibility for an Asian music network to be formed – one which transcends national borders against the transnational capitalist greed. Presently, FEN, as well as Asian Meeting Festival / Asian Music Network, are trying to make this network true, by galvanizing and joining up the people and the occurrences of music scenes. We do not need to use music as a tool to convey political thought, but hope that music can eventually be independent of any ideology.\nAlluding back to 1992, or before, to postulate a notion that to even have something like this happening, is already a political statement, regardless of how a small, fleeting, contagious, subjectless organism it may be. We hope music lovers can take a little time to know one another, create some noise and listen to each other. Please continue to do what you love.\nFEN成立于2008年夏天。\n来自日本、韩国、中国和新加坡的4个乐手，在大友良英的介绍下，在法国马赛第一次全体碰面，然后参加了MIMI音乐节。我们花很多时间吃饭、聊天，然后是调音、即兴演奏，没有人谈论音乐，或者提出任何演奏方案。从那时到现在，我们的乐器和音乐发生了很多次变化，但仍然从不谈论音乐。\n这是我们第一次出版实体唱片。它来自FEN迄今惟一的一次美国之旅：2016年5月，在私立机构日本协会的邀请下，我们在纽约做了演出和录音。演出分两部分，上半场我们在日本协会大堂的一楼和二楼，分别在不同的位置演奏。下半场是在会场的舞台上，一起。这里就是下半场的录音。\n从2015年10月的日本巡演开始，袁志伟第一次在硬件效果器之外加入了电吉他，颜峻简化了设备，只用一套简单的反馈系统，大友良英也开始只用一把电吉他演奏。在这之前，柳汉吉已经开始使用 max/MSP，他用即兴写下的句子，来定义一段声音。这种双吉他构成的摇滚／爵士元素，加上电子设备和电脑的噪音，在传统的由旋律和布鲁斯和弦主导的结构和“任何人都可能主导／根本没有主导”的结构之间摆动，形成了最近一段时间 FEN 的特色。\nFEN 刚刚创建的时候，袁志伟用电脑处理他在桌子上摩擦出的声音，那是一种非常安静优美的电子氛围声音；颜峻使用一套复杂的反馈系统，有时候也用人声；大友良英除了吉他，还演奏鼓、黑胶唱机和一些电子设备；柳汉吉则使用一套钟表发条、齿轮构成的机械装置。我们不知道下一次相聚的时候，又会发生什么变化。\n在将近10年的时间里，FEN已经很多次在亚洲和欧洲巡演，也几次在中国演出（北京的伊比利亚中心、两个好朋友酒吧，上海的育音堂、外滩美术馆）。每个成员都不只是演奏者，而是也组织、策划大量的活动，我们试着在亚洲的新音乐场景中找到更多的舞台。我们得到过很多朋友和机构的帮助，自己也花费了大量的精力，一次巡演可能就需要写几百封邮件，再加上复杂的签证手续，还有可能遇到的政治压力，还有高强度的巡演和潜伏在角落的小偷。很麻烦，但也让创作音乐变得更有意思。这一次，来自日本、中国、新加坡、韩国的乐手，在美国会合，在一个以推广日本文化为宗旨的私人机构（这个建筑的对面就是联合国总部）演出，最后在中国出版，听起来很有趣，但也不只是有趣，这是我们的现实。\n早在1992年，大友良英就在他的第一张个人专辑“We Insist?”的内页中谈到，是否有可能建立一个跨越国界的，以反抗高度发达的跨国资本主义为目的的亚洲音乐网络。现在，FEN，还有亚洲聚会音乐节／亚洲音乐网络（Asian Meeting Festival/Asian Music Network），正在以人和人的相遇、音乐现场的发生，来尝试这样的网络。我们不需要用音乐来传达政治思想，事实上，我们希望音乐自身是独立于任何意识形态的。要对1992年，或者更早、更广泛的思考做一个回答的话，那么，这种相遇和发生，已经足够去形成一种政治语言，它是许多小型的、临时的交流，也是蔓延的、无主题的有机体。我们希望喜欢音乐的人可以有机会去互相认识，发出一些噪音并且互相聆听，希望每个人都坚持去做自己喜欢的事情。",

            "about": "abstract rock!\n(go to the label's page for more releases, and maybe cheaper shipping:  ujikaji.bandcamp.com)\nFEN is an improvised music quartet. Comprising Otomo Yoshihide (Japan), Yuen Chee Wai (Singapore), Yan Jun (China) and Ryu Hankil (Korea), it was formed in 2008 in Marseille.\nThe initial intent of forming FEN was not based on a particular pursuit of any specific form of musical aesthetic, but rather to develop and deepen the improvised music networks of Asia. This desire was furthered by these 4 individuals, each with their individual endeavours to organise music-related activities and bridge communication, using a kind of improvisational music vernacular to connect one another. Within the quartet, and beyond, FEN strives for a collaboration that is direct and non-dominant based, while achieving a musical flow that is fluid and symbiotic.\nConcurrently, the 4 members are active contributors in the fields of experimental, improvised, computer and electronic music, visual art, performance, literary, curatorial and publication fields. Their creative work is strongly reinforced within the idea of networks and genealogy.\nThe music of FEN has been described as a combination of noise, random occurrences, rock, free jazz and the likes, in an improvisational rigour without any prior communicated agreement. Each member is free to change and choose their musical instrument and methodology of performance.\nFEN has toured Japan, China and Europe, and has played festivals in North America, UK, Korea and Singapore. In 2018, FEN collaborated with Singaporean artist Ho Tzu Nyen for a new work in the Gwangju Biennale. FEN have also been commissioned for a new work with NeoN ensemble for Borealis Festival 2020.",

            "about": "M is a special improvisation project initiated by Yan Jun and Wong Chung-fai. The first performance of M was presented in Shenzhen (Neo Sound, 2009). In the same year, another performance was presented in Beijing (Waterland Kwanyin, 2009), with Yan Jun and Wong Chung-fai improvising on Harmonic Field. It is a unique instrument designed and handmade by American sound art device artists, Arius Blaze and Ben Houston of Folktek. No keyboard. No strings. Only forty-eight metal contact points. The performer is required to use his/her body as part of the circuitry to generate sounds.\nM is a documentation of the mentioned two performances.",

            "about": "Micro Feedback is my project with this pocket set up: Edirol R09 digital recorder, cheap imitation Apple earphones, 2-to-1 Y-adapters (aka headphones splitter).\nit was published as accompanied cd with the book \"Génération dakou. Ecouter, recycler, expérimenter\" (van Dieren/LUFF; 2012):\nwww.riponoff.ch\ni play this for small amount of audience. on street, at a restaurant, in a bus, or anywhere we like. sometimes combined with my Living Room Tour project, by which i play at audience's home.\nso everything here are real time feedback between earphone and build-in microphones of the recorder.\nexcept track 06: field recording by Knut Remond at Ohrenhoch, Berlin. the sound was playing in my flat during the recording. this track was previously exhibited as sound work at Ohrenhoch.\ntrack 05 was played in a closed room for one audience, more audience were in another space listen from speakers.\nthanx: Nikola Mounoud, Thibault Walter and the team of LUFF/Van Dieren, Hsia Yu, Reinaart Vanhoe, Feng Shuo, Adel Wang Jing, Otomo Yoshihide, Kunt Remond and Ohrenhoch\nnote: the sounds in this CD contains rich and detailed high frequencies. pls use proper stereo speakers to listen. do not use build-in speakers of your stupid laptop. headphone is always better. compress them into mp3 or m4a may loss these vital high frequencies.\nreview by Massimo Ricci:  touchingextremes.wordpress.com/2015/02/05/yan-jun-micro-feedback-trigger/",

It contains some short pieces of voice with field recordings, or recordings of voice on site. Each speaker of the voices has to decide his/her opportune time to interpose the voice into the environment. For me as a Chinese, it is so difficult to speak this word correctly in German, or Italian, even in English. This is a very political problem, isn't it? So let's solve it in a political way, cheers!\ncredit:\ndeveloped from previous work “At A Cafe House” in which Klaus Filip and Noid illustrating the pronunciation of \"grappa\" for me. that recording was included in Yan Jun's field recording album \"Mars Tour Diary\", 2010, Art World.\nvoice and field recording contributed by: 8GG, Berno Oto Polzer, DJ Phaks, Edward Sanderson, Eric Mattson, Irina, Feng Shuo, Kåkon Lindbaack, Lea Schneider, Li Chaolin, Luca Forcucci, Mattin, Mei Zhiyong, Olaf Hochherz, Sandra Bobersky, Song Yuzhe, Sun Wei, Tillmann Severin, Yan Jun, Yuen Cheewai, Zhao Hengheng and Zhu Wenbo",

                    "about": "在使用耳机或者（左右对位摆放的）音箱时，如果左右两个声道的声音的音高非常接近，声音又简单（理想的话就是正弦波），人脑会自动产生一个起伏的波浪般的节奏。这个节奏的周期，由左右两边声音的高低之差决定。例如，如果左边是300赫兹，右边是305赫兹，那么这个节奏就是每秒5次。据说这个并不存在的节奏会影响脑波，而使人舒缓、安眠。\n我的兴趣在于，既然这个声音是大脑自己造出来的，那么，左边的、右边的这些振动，当然也是大脑根据自己的设定而转换成了相应的电信号，通过神经的传输，而被感知为“声音”。当我说“好”的时候，意念驱使，喉头振动，你就会将空气振动转换成电子，再转换成你脑中的“好”。这可能是一种普遍的幻觉。\n不管怎么说，我们（左边的我和右边的我）很乐意同意你，让你感觉到好，并且使你安眠。\n(tried my best to speak cantonese in this track)",

            "about": "I think it was in 2009 when i received email from Lionel... Wow, it’s long enough to scheme a coup. Maybe two... Since then we discussed a lot about release his work on Sub Jam label and invite him to China... I wrote this long story into the book The Only Authentic Work which has been published with Lionel’s CD 23 Formes en Élastique as one work in 2013.\nThen he came to China for a release tour. The day he arrived in Beijing was one of the heavy pollution days. On taxi to my home from airport was like lost in a cyberpunk film. He told me later: Mamma mia! I thought it was apocalyptic! But surely we survived from it and got a lot of bonus. Hot pot, Forbiden City, ink paitings, alcohol, black tea, music and friends, frozen worm and more hot pots. Then the trip to Shanghai and Hangzhou. And more alcohol and friends. And sounds, which are entirely, constantly embracing us and jumping into our recorders.\nWe traveled with Soviet Pop, an electronic music duo based in Beijing. 6 events in 3 cities including Beijing. In two weeks i discovered these cities as a traveller as well. Beijing was dusty, huge and droning. Hangzhou looked rich and tasty. Shanghai was fresh. We call it the capital of magic. I can recall so many pieces of moments of sounds, lights, colours, smells and faces... Yes that’s tour as it always been.\nLionel has wrote a lot of poems after this trip. I wrote few. Also we made photos and field recordings. Yes. That made a balance to what we eat (lamb and noodles) and breath (air with smog) from the world. Or maybe not. I’m not really sure what we did to the world. We just spent some time together with helps from people and electricity. The foods were fantastic anyway.\nBefore the last day Lionel stayed in China we recorded this album at an artist friend (Lili Chin)’s residency studio in Shanghai. Both we had speaker cones as instruments so we recorded our sounds from them. Plus recordings from our mixers. That was November 11th, 2013, in one of the most expensive hotels of the world.\nThanks: Ambassade De France En Chine, Zajia, Zhejiang University, China Academy of Art in Hangzhou, Chronus Art Center, 1984, Xin Che Jian and people who we had dinner together (Adel Wang Jing and BUS, Dajuin Yao, Lili Chin, Yin Yi of BM Space, Soviet Pop...).\nYan Jun.\n21. 7. 2014.",

            "about": "released by zoomin' night records. pls go to the label's page for more releases:  zoominnight.bandcamp.com\n最近我在想一件事，叫做“专注于没什么”，或者“聚焦于全部”，既不是不专注也不是只专注于一样东西。用英语说应该是“concentrate on nothing\"。我是先用英语来想的。这和即兴合奏有关，人们喜欢说，即兴合奏要专注聆听对方的声音，不要只顾自己爽。但事实上没人能做到，因为你还得听自己的声音，你还得听几个人合起来的声音，还得听环境的声音或者说气氛。小场地的话，观众什么时候换个姿势坐、什么时候调整呼吸，也都和气氛有关，他们紧张起来就会不动，松弛下来就会出很多声音，这些会影响演出。没人会专门去听这些，但是乐手会知道。明察秋毫，但是并没有专门去察。\n这几年我对欧洲经典的自由即兴感到厌烦。尤其是乐器之间的对话。“对话”是一个非常古典的欧洲概念，去参加几个趴替就知道了，随便扯住一个话题就开聊，真心聊。这和民主政治的传统有关。也和人们对民主的想象力的局限性有关。\n在欧洲，演出后我常听到的一个赞美就是“very concentrate”。但我并不喜欢只有一个焦点，就像文艺复兴以来的油画透视法。专注是一种精神状态，不是操作流程。\n在田野录音的领域，很多我喜欢的艺术家不爱用指向性话筒。很多人用一对全向话筒，例如角田俊也。这造成一种完全没有特定事件的景象，这种聆听带来的震撼，要比任何景观艺术更强烈，更深。用福柯谈论布朗肖的话说，有时候你得沉默才能让别人来听你。\n这个录音是一次‘客厅巡演“的现场录音。我们有一个简单的作曲结构。作曲总长一小时。所以录音也是一小时左右。\n它并不只是一个记录。它期待着播放、听，或者其他的，另一个行动。\n感谢李英武。\n颜峻\nrecently i'm thinking about one thing. which is \"concentrate on nothing\". or \"focus on everything\". it's neither focus on one thing, nor with no concentration. it's from some discussion about improvisation in improvised music. people always say good manner means listen carefully to other's sound. don't be big ego. but actually no one can do it because you have to listen to your own sound, the sound all together, and environment sound or so-called atmosphere. if it's small venue the atmosphere could be changed by audiences when they change a sitting posture or adjust their breath. if they are in tension they would not move at all. if they feel loss they might make lots sounds. and all these are feedback into the performance. nobody would concentrate on listening to these but musicians' percipience is on. you know everything without intentionally to know.\nthese years i feel boring with classical european free improvised music. especially the dialogues between instruments. dialogue is a very classical european concept. in everyday life you can see people really enjoy nonsense conversations during parties. of course this is related to the tradition of democracy. and it's also related to the limit of ability of imagination on democracy.\nin europe, after concerts, i often hear comments as \"it's very concentrate\". but i don't like to have only one focus, as perspective in oil painting after renaissance. be concentrated is a mental status instead of operational process.\nin the field of field recording, many of my favorite artists use a pair of omni-direction microphones (for instance, toshiya tsunoda). this leads to a scene with totally no specific event. the shock from this kind of listening is more intense and deeper than any spectacular art. according to michel foucault (on maurice blanchot), sometimes you have to keep silent in order to let people to listen to you.\nthis is live recording of a \"living room tour\". we had a simple composition. one hour composition. so the recording we leave here is also about one hour.\nit's not just a document. it's here waiting for another action such as playing back, listening or whatever.\nthanx to li yingwu.\nyan jun",
