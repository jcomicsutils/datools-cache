Most of the recorded sounds were made with electric guitar, simple yamaha synth and various effect pedals, and with human voice too. Some of the sounds are recycled samples from earlier recordings, but now in a new form. Final mastering by Pentti Dassum, October 2012.\nThe story of this album, and also Uton, is about human mind connecting to the unknown forces of the universe (and vice versa). Human mind doesn't have a form of human itself, but also the form of the formless. That's how we are with the eternal space, all and nothing included. Whatever the form is, it's always changing and moving, like the life itself.\n\"Observe always that everything is the result of a change, and get used to thinking that there is nothing Nature loves so well as to change existing forms and to make new ones like them.\" —Meditations. iv. 36. – Marcus Aurelius\nAnno Mundi (Latin: \"in the year of the world\")\n▲▲▲\nAlso available on double-LP - 140 gram black vinyl. Edition of 250 copies. Comes in a gatefold sleeve with colourful psychedelic collage inside. Released by Crazy Iris Records.\nwww.crissy.org.uk/yes",

            "about": "This album was recorded in early 2022. It´s a sampler based multilayer composition with some additional playing (for example electric guitar on track 2, and some synth waves in several places). Mixed in many parts during 2022 and also once in early 2023.\nCassette and CDR versions were available in pre-order only. If some label wants to release this album properly on cassette/vinyl/CD at some point, then we will have some more copies (logically).\nArchaic Symbols album supports the listeners inner journey to the deep mystical research about the hidden or unseen worlds and perspectives. These symbols are carved into our collective memory, from the forgotten ages.\nMusic, photography, artwork, production by Jani Hirvonen\n***\nFree download codes\ntinyurl.com/bdfrckh5\nDonations are welcome:\nwww.paypal.com/paypalme/UtonMagmaTones\nPhysical items available at\nmagmatones.blogspot.com/p/shop.html",

            "about": "Album was released originally on cd-r by Californian label Jewelled Antler (2003), and with bonus tracks by Last Visible Dog (2005). Recorded in Tampere, Finland.\nTracks 1-7 are from original \"Ay Um Au Lam\" album. Tracks 8-9 are from the same recording sessions, and first time released on triple-cd \"Whispers From The Woods\" (Last Visible Dog). Tracks 10-12 are from 3\"cdr \"Buddhamania\" (267 Lattajjaa, 2003), and was also released again on \"Whispers From The Woods\".\n\"Uton's most impressive foray into minimal droneworks. Hirvonen never overwhelms you with the electronic tones on Ay Um Au Lam. He knows when to hold back and let the listener's imagination fill in any gaps or cracks that he leaves out. It's an underrated skill, but is used to perfection on this album. Ay Um Au Lam is the logical precursor to what is my favorite Uton release to date, The August Light. Where that release had rich, organic threads weaving through it, like it was the modern music of the magic woods, Ay Um Au Lam is more primitive. It's the primordial soup that all life emerged from. In this simple state, this is pure beauty\" - Brad Rose / Foxy Digitalis\n\"Uton is by no means a newcomer to these pages and it's easy to see why after treating my ears with Buddhamania a few times. It's a spiritual, highly transporting drone affair that either will have you thinking about the mystical forests around Tampere, Finland or some far away temple. I connect more closely to the first description but you should probably bear in mind that it's mostly the most frightening part of the forests that Uton has mastered describing.\" - Mats Gustafsson / Broken Face",

            "about": "Originally released on CDR by RuralFaune (rur017) in 2006. Edition on 100 copies. Om Ha Sva Ha Ksha Ma La Va Ra Yam released this album digitally in 2011 (OM-40), and it was available over 10 years at Free Music Archive.\nMastered again in 12/2022 for this present version, by Jani Hirvonen.\nTrack 1 was recorded in 9/2005, featuring J.Koho. Track 2 in early 2006 - at Castle Mountain High (LInnavuori, Finland). Final edit & studio work for the track 1 was made in The Mouth of Life & Death (Monninkylä, Finland) 9/2006.\nTrack 1 was originally used as a background tape for the first UTON live show, but it was played directly from the four-track recorded and also mixed differently during the live set. This background tape wasn´t very audible during the live, and as it sounded rich and interesting enough, it was released separately. That live set can be heard from the album Suoniin, Luihin, Ytimiin:  uton.bandcamp.com/album/suoniin-luihin-ytimiin\nSleeve art painting by Miijja. Layout and other works by Jani Hirvonen.",

            "about": "kongkong was the solo project of Jani Hirvonen around 1997-2001, time before Uton. Two very limited edition tapes were released, but most of the recordings stayed unreleased.\nNow in 2018 is time to change that, so the selected best parts will be released digitally in Bandcamp.\nFirst release is this one called \"Brain damage in Tampere City\", which contains recordings from Tampere, 1999. The master tape didn't have any other information, except \"end 1999\", so it probably means these were mixed in the end of 1999... which means the tracks were recorded in the second part of 1999; probably... at least, very nearly like that.\nTrack order on this release is exactly the same as it was on the original cassette.\nAll tracks were recorded with 4-track cassette recorder, using electronic manipulation, electic guitar (prepared and out of tune), percussions, voice, flutes etc. No computers and digital stuff at that time.\nDigitally edited & mastered in Turku, July-August 2018.\n***\nLactofermented Subconsciousness\nLSUB-021",

            "about": "Hours of recordings from the streets, and whatever happened to sound around while cycling on the way with the recorder. Cycle of one year put all together tightly, layered on top of each other and still respecting the time line linearity and letting the thing go further into its end.\nRecorded at the area of Turku, from September 2022 to August 2023 - sometimes downtown, sometimes in a quiet country side style (not so deeply, but nearly). Mostly while on the saddle, but sometimes also walking. You may hear the steps, and defintely hearing the cycles of the wheel and a lot of it. It may even drive to sleep, with the random background sounds and noises.\nRecordings, production and artwork by Jani Hirvonen.\n***\nFree download codes available at:  tinyurl.com/yndjyezw\n(edition of 100)\nIf you think it's worth of paying, please use the  paypal.me  link\nThank you!",

            "about": "▲▲▲▲▲\n4-track tape recordings from 7/2010 (Rennes),\nexcept “Paradox One & Two”; 10/2010 (Chantepie). Final edit + mix early 2011. All sounds + sleeve art\nby Uton. Mastered by Pentti Dassum.\nStereo headphones recommended for listening! (no other speakers were used during recordings and mixing of this album). For a stronger effect, listen near midnight in a dark room (or with minimal light). Do not let anything else disturb you.\n▲▲▲▲▲\nReleased on vinyl LP by Ikuisuus and DNT Records, 6/2012. Limited edition of 275 copies. Available straight from the artist:  utonspace@gmail.com  - or from the record labels:  www.dntrecords.com  and  www.ikuisuus.net\nDNT Records edition = 110 hand-numbered copies.\nCheck also the bonus album: Kun Korallit Puhuvat Pilville (also in bandcamp)\n▲▲▲▲▲\nAs the album title could say, this is a way to the \"wonderland\" (also called as \"other side\" - many names been used during the history of humankind), which shouldn't be mixed for the adventure's of famous Alice - even it might give some idea about what is going to happen, but that's just a start of it all - the start of nothing else but listeners mind. What are the \"echoes\" then? They are something which are coming from beyond to here where we stay - so album being a link between these worlds; inside & outside; like they are working together. That's all quite obvious - psychedelic transmissions of conciousness.\nIt's been recorded in Bretagne, France, 7/2010 & 10/2010, using old school four-track tape recorded for catching the sound from (effected or non-effected) sources, like electric guitar, synths, percussions & vocals. Sound is mostly improvised, multi-layered experimentations, made for headphone listening (other ways possible too), letting go; eyes closed if possible. Something relaxing, something a bit noisy & out of mind, something strange... something where a mind can wander in peace.",

Shortly mixed and mastered (to keep it enough uncooked and fresh) later on... and few days after uploaded to the web. There was no passion enough to start to send demos to any labels; as the sound is probably just too much for any self-respecting label to actually release it... and to make (another) super limited edition self-released cassette or cd wasn't also sounding very exciting. If a miracle would happen (!) that some label would be interested to release this physically, I am open to speak about it (please contact).\" - Jh/Yksi\nListen here and find the free download codes:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDO6Mc7W3Ek\nDonations are welcome:\nwww.paypal.com/paypalme/UtonMagmaTones\nMore about this project:\nyksinoise.blogspot.com",

            "about": "Elonkehto = The cradle of life\n\"Psychedelic drone excursion into the other realms. Lie down, close your eyes, and let the sound lead you away for a while. What you will see and witness depends what you have in there, in a mirrorland of mental reflections. Make it twice, and then come back again. How is it to be, in the cradle of life\"\n***\nThe material of this album was recorded in Hämeenlinna, 2008. Originally it was intented to be on a collaboration project, but the project never finished, so the sounds were storaged and forgotten for over 16 years, until 2025. \"Elonkehto\" is a mixed and edited of those raw tracks. This album version offers 2 different mixes of \"Elonkehto\" - sounding basically same, but having some slight differences.\nAvailable on cassette, released by Magma Tones, 2025.\nOnly 20 copies made (recycled cassettes). Use contact form to make your order.\nDigital version available at  ko-fi.com/uton_/shop\nSounds, artwork & layout by Jani Hirvonen; except the reddish images, which are originally from the old Karelian handicraft works.",

            "about": "(IKU-043 / HYSTER22) 2016\nVinyl LP - edition of 200 copies.\n\"The title of the record combined with the organic paraphernalia may provoke the image of a „touch me not“, a sensitive plant. That's a bit misleading since Grykë Pyje, the duo of Jani Hirvonen (Uton) and Johannes Schebler (Baldruin), are not exactly fussy when it comes to bustle around with a lot of stuff - sometimes not exactly musical instruments. Together they built a soundworld as colorful and detailed as a field of flowers in the summer. On first sight one may be overwhelmed by the vast amount of impressions but the more time one takes the more detail can be experienced. So, enter the world of Grykë Pyje, get lost in a lovely and psychedelic pasture, but be careful: don't step on the daisies!\" - Holger Adam",

            "about": "Full tracklist:\n1 - Opening Of The Circle (5:40)\n2 - Here, Next To Nowhere (5:14)\n3 - Dealing With The Moonlight (5:00)\n4 - The Earth Is Listening (6:44)\n5 - Ba (Ba), The Other Side (4:20)\n6 - Disappeared Souls (5:42)\n7 - Spirit Of The Million Woods (7:30)\n8 - Eternal Mystery, Alone (5:47)\n9 - Zero To 1 / 1 To Zero (2:15)\n10 - The Shining One (3:27)\nThis album was originally released on CD, 8/8/2011 by Japanese label Musik Atlach. Still available.  www.bajoeng.jp/release.html\nRecordings are made with 4-track tape recorder during 2004-2005 in Tampere, Finland. Edited and mastered in Chantepie, France, 2011.\n\"This is one of Uton’s more enigmatic releases, with the sound of nowhere channelled via automating electronics and hovering planetary-scale drones over endless whispering forests of microtonal choirs.\" - Volcanic Tongue\n\"All material on this album was recorded already around 2004-2005 in Tampere, using prepared electric guitar and effects (mostly bass distortion, echo and reverb), violin bow and few simple & cheap second hand keyboards + manipulated voice (some other instruments too, if I remember well)- and recorded with cassette four-track and later digitally edited and mixed. I wanted to release it earlier, but never had a really good possibility to do that. It took long time to just listen to these tracks, and feel the ambience, and choose the best parts (from total 3 full cd's). So kind of difficult work, but at the same time one of the most favourite result. It's maybe the most atmospheric ambient album on Uton catalogue too; transcendental and dark, like the night sky full of mysteries\" - Uton",

Music, production, sleeve art by Jani Hirvonen.\nOriginally released on CDR by Students of Decay (SoD-35). Edition of 150 copies. Digitally released by Om Ha Sva Ha Ksha Ma La Va Ra Yam (OM-39) in 2011. It was available in Free Music Archive until 2022.\nThe music was made with various electric and acoustic instruments and recorded with four-track cassette recorder.\nThis new available version was remastered from the original version. Not much done, but slightly upgraded anyway. The cassette hiss noise wasn´t removed, so that´s purely intentional.\nBased to the vibrations and teachings of the magical golden turtle (from the valley of endless dreams and miracles;at the source of it all)",

            "about": "Hossan Virtoja (Streams of Hossa)\nField recordings from Hossa National Park, Finland / June 28.-30. 2022\nFinal mastering made in Turku, March 2024.\n1. Recorded at Värikallio area, on a small bridge nearby the rock paintings. This bridge is on top of the river which goes between the lakes Somer and Ala-Ölkky. 28.6.2022\n2. Recorded on a way between Lihapyörre shelter and Laukkujärvi (lake). The path goes just next to the Somerjoki (river). 28.6.2022\n3. Recorded at Suottavirta (stream), which is a short river part between the lakes Syvä Suottajärvi and Saari-Hoilua. We were on our way from Puukkojärvi to Kokalmus. 29.6.2022\n4. Recorded at Ala-Valkeinen hiking hut area, a small stream between the lakes Keski-Valkeainen and Ala-Valkeainen. 29.6.2022\n5. Recorded at Torkonluikea fireplace area, where goes the stream between the lakes Huosiusjärvi and Syvä-Hoilua. 30.6.2022\n6. Recorded at Hakokoski (rapids), nearby the fireplace and bridge. 30.6.2022\n7. Recorded at Iikoski (rapids), on a bridge area near the lake Hypäs. 30.6.2022\nThe original idea was to record many type of nature sounds on this trip, but after all the biggest and most common sound source to record was all those rapids and streams. Very few bird sounds (some are also on a background of these recordings). Also a LOOOOT of gadflies (and many varities of them as well)! It was very hot season (+30 C every day), so those buggers were very active and didn't let us (me & my wife) in peace almost anywhere. The result of all those recordings is this short album, or more likely an EP. A collection of sounds from the rapids & streams.\nYear later we made a trip to Urho Kekkonen National Park (at East side of Finnish Lapland), and again the water sounds were recorded (there was even less birds). Full lenght album of those recordings is coming at some point of 2024.\nHossa National Park is a very beautiful place. It's located at Kainuu area (east of Finland), just under the Lapland. We had a hot summer weather every day, and there was plenty of places to swim on lakes. Excellent place to visit and to witness some unique wonder of Finnish nature.\nPhotos from these recording locations are visible here:\ntinyurl.com/3mp63cmb\nAll recordings, productions, photos and layout by Jani Hirvonen.\nMore about Hossa National Park, please visit at  www.nationalparks.fi/hossa",

Recorded with four-track tape recorder, and various primitive electro-acoustic instruments.\nThis mini-album was never released, and only very few (if any) people heard these recordings. Tapes of all kongkong-material have been stored in boxes (in cellars and even on cabin's attic) for many years, going through many moves, and now finally digitalized and released.\nSleeve art by Jani Hirvonen, 2018.\nDigitally edited & mastered in Turku, July-August-November 2018.\n***\nLactofermented Subconsciousness\nLSUB-022",

Yksi was started already in 2006, but activated recently in 2020. On this tape Yksi delivers two longs tracks of free-flowing cosmic harsh noise, sounds resonating from within and universe beyond.\" - Satatuhatta\n***\nYksi is my solo project which was originally started already in 2006, but it was basically just one recording session (and released digitally few years later), but one year ago I became interested to produce again some harsher noise sounds, so as the result didn't really fit under UTON, I decided to use the name Yksi.\nThis new album was recorded live with Korg synth and effects and edited/mixed with computer. Side B is basically a remix, but with different effect setup and some more sounds added (field recordings and samples). 2x 20 minutes! Very happy to have this album released, and specially on this label 💥🙏\nAll sounds & artwork by Jani Hirvonen.\n***\nMore YKSI albums available at\nmagmatones.bandcamp.com",

For a stronger effect, listen near midnight in a dark room (or with minimal light).

            "about": "More recordings from the past. This was about one year before UTON was born, in Summer 2000. Actual dates for these recordings are impossible to know, but these tracks were digitized from the four-track tape recordings with a note \"summer 2000\" on the case/cassette (so, probably recorded around spring/summer).\nTracks 1-9 are from the first tape, and 10-15 from the second. So this album is a \"compilation\" from those. Another set of recordings from these same tapes have been released as a mini-album \"Rearranged Jukebox Standards\". Those tracks are shorter and didn´t really fit to this more \"compact\" album.\nMany instruments were used on these recordings. Most common instrument was electric guitar with effect pedals, and then of course the effect pedals with some feedback experiments (aka \"electronics\"), effected/distorted microphone with all kind of \"junk\", twisted vocals, mumblings, percussions etc.\nTrack 1 is much different to the other tracks. It was an experiment with computer editing software. It was a simple stereo sound editor, which was used to build that track from pre-recorded samples.\nDigitized, edited, and mastering in 2018, Re-mastered (for the release) in April 2023. All sounds and artwork by Jani Hirvonen.",

            "about": "Album was released originally on cd by US label Digitalis Recordings (2006), and recorded in Tampere, Finland, between 2004 and 2005.\n\"Mystery Revolution is a sonic excursion through the Finnish forests unlike any other. Massive drones are balanced by the hypnotic dance of flutes, bells, and keyboards. Underneath everything runs a mind-altering stream of fuzzed-out brainwaves. Every corner you turn, there's another smiling nymph, begging you to follow the golden path into the mystic woods. Uton's minimalist rumblings are there to infect and enchant, and Hirvonen never fails to impress.\nThe mask is off with Mystery Revolution, and Uton will remain shrouded in obscurity no more. This pine-scented excursion may by mysterious on the surface, but overall is a thing of beauty, lying in wait for the perfect time to infect you. Mystery Revolution is proof that Uton's dreamy soundscapes are one of Finland's finest exports\" - Digitalis",

It was probably recorded earlier the same year or somewhere around 2003-2004 in Tampere, Finland.\nHere we have field recordings from the area of Tampere, improvised instruments for example piano (recorded at the local public library), flutes, bells, ethnic string instrument(s), electric guitar, bowed strings, violin, electronics and maybe (so not surely) something else. Recorded and mixed with cassette 4-track.\nwww.discogs.com/release/454930-Uton-Untitled",

            "about": "This album was recorded in 1999, by Jani Hirvonen. The tracks are from two different \"sessions\" (= tapes recorded around the same time); first part: tracks 1-7 (february 1999), second part 8-16 (but the last two tracks might be from the third session). These were all probably recorded in Porvoo, but some of the tracks from the second part (or third) might be from Tampere; difficult to know exactly, but probably no-one cares anyway.\nCassette 4-track recordings. These were never released, but some of the tracks were sent to some friends. Various instruments were used, as you may hear (if not, it's fine: no problem).\nSleeve art by Jani Hirvonen, 2018.\nDigitally edited & mastered in Turku, July-August-December 2018.\n***\nLactofermented Subconsciousness\nLSUB-023",

            "about": "Improvised and recorded in a piano room of the main library in Turku, Finland.\nMusic, production and sleeve art by Jani Hirvonen / UTON.\nSleeve and sound production in January 2025.\nThis music is suitable for any type of speaker system. Every way gives a different aspect, but basically any way is as fine. May it be headphones (with caution! read more info later in this sheet), stereo (or mono) speakers, bluetooth mini speaker, laptop speaker or even a phone, it's all fine as long as the sound is audible. Loud volume is not recommended, but it may be tried if wanted or needed.\nSuitable to listen alone or with friends, on a background or by concentrating... or something between. Take a nap, fall asleep with it, cook with it, or focus while resting your eyes and muscles. Listen at home in silence or take it with you outside and listen in a park or on the beach and let the environment sounds get mixed into the listening experience. Many many possibilities in this spiritual interaction.\nThis music doesn't compete with other music pieces or composers. It just is. It's not perfect. It's not musically correct or awesome and wonderful... or it may be. It all depends in a way of how to think, how to listen, and how to feel. The main line goes in feelings and mood. Where the sound may lead the mind? Does it support the emotions, and if it does, which type of emotions? Does it lead outside from everyday feelings and moods, and can it offer something else? If it doesn't feel fine while just listening, does it become better with some tasks, like writing or painting? Is it actually better on a quiet near silent mode?\nWhen this music was played, there was no actual vision of what is really going on. Just sitting next to piano and playing. Letting the hands go where the heart and mind let them go. No specific thoughts or ideas, just letting go. Sometimes some thoughts may have appeared, but never took the place to control the process. Focus was to let go, and to let the spirit lead the way. The spirit with its lights and shadows.\nAbout the recording quality. No, it's not a pro-studio production, and not even near of it. It doesn't even pretend to be that. First of all, these recordings were not originally meant to be released in a way as they now are here on this album. The main idea was to collect recordings for a later use (for Uton or other related projects); and that also was made - but, because these piano recordings were sounding interesting enough as they are, still, over two years later, it started to be a real useful idea to release these without extra treatment (ok, some parts may be also on some other Uton album at some point, cannot quarantee that, but that possibility exists... and it's fine, or at least OK).\nThese improvisations were recorded with a smartphone app + a simple cheapish Boya microphone. Nothing super hi-fi, but still better than the phone's own built-in microphone. The piano room in the library is very small and there was some extra noises coming to these recordings. One of the biggest sounds is the piano chair, which was squaking very badly, and you can here it - but - it's a part of the thing in this document, and cannot be removed (without losing nerves, completely). There's also some quieter ticking sound, which might coming from a clock, which was still there at that time. That ticking repetitive sound is not much audible with speakers, but with headphones it may become a problem for someone's sensitive vibe. If so, please play with quieter volume or move to speakers. Anyways, high volume is not required or not even recommended while playing this album.\n● ● ●\nThere's also another Piano Music album released by Uton. It was recorded in 2008, and released in 2013. It's available for free in  utonspace.blogspot.com  but you have to find the link for it. Fortunately it's not too difficult (but the music might be).",

It's all connected through the invisible energy web, where the souls are charging and directing their spiritual understanding for the whole population of earthy creatures\n8. so, that moment when the so-called structure was identified, now hiding between the heart of a subconsciousness and a pink glowing twilight - cannot be demystified any longer\n9. that dream, as we told earlier in a pure silence; predicted its way into a profound uncompromised excellence",

            "about": "Part One (tracks 1-37) was recorded around 2002-2003 in Tampere.\nPart Two (tracks 38-74) was recorded between 2004-2008 in Tampere, Linnavuori, Monninkylä and Hämeenlinna.\nEdited and mastered in Chantepie, France in 2012-2013.\nThere was something wrong with these tracks, it was impossible to add any of them to any other albums, because \"these fellows\" were mostly too short, or too much away from the main idea/concept. So year after year, there started to be more an more this type of tracks; full of feeling, but no way to really release any of them. But now - in 2012-2013 these recordings are finally edited to be together - in a huge process of Psychic Archives series. 74 short tracks with pure action and non-action as well, sudden changes, passion, moody mutations, emotional... and mentally out there too. It's a big mix to eat, even bigger to hear - but it may give some new vibes to our every day psychic system. It might be a bit disturbing too?\nAlso available in limited edition double CDR set\nOM HA SVA HA KSHA MA LA VA RA YAM / OM-50",

            "about": "This album was originally released on double-CDr in 2008 by Om Ha Sva Ha Ksha Ma La Va Ra Yam in an edition of 100 copies. In 2010 it was reissued digitally on Free Music Archive and it was available for free in mp3 format until the end of 2022.\nThis new reissue is a remastered version from February 2023.\nPart 1: RADIO OLIO (tracks 1-8) were recorded and mixed between 7/2007 - 9/2007 in Monninkylä, Finland.\nPart 2: THE BOOK OF BEGINNINGS (tracks 9-15). Original first four-track recordings were made between 11/2005 - 4/2006 in Linnavuori, Finland. Additional recordings & cuts from 8/2007 - 12/2007 in Monninkylä, Finland.\nCollaborations were made via the possibilites of internet, except the tracks with J.Koho (aka Kulkija), 11/2005. The list of collaborators:\nBrad Rose (track: 13), J. Koho (9C, 11, 14), Magnus Olsen Majmon (9A, 9B, 11), Maxime Primault (9C, 14), Vanessa Rossetto (12). The Original sleeve art by Mervi.\nThe mp3 version of this album was downloaded 29000 times between 2010-2022. That of course sounds very absurd, but that´s how Free Music Archive´s page showed the data - and they also confirmed that there was not a bug on their site. Similar absurd download numbers were on many Uton and related releases. It´s hard to really know what happened, and how to actually explain all that; and that mystery will probably stay hidden forever.",

            "about": "● This EP is a collection of recordings made in Tampere, Finland, 2000. These tracks are leftovers from the compiled full lenght albums, so (more or less) perfectly working well together as a compilation of \"abandoned experiments\", but not too bad to keep away from the public ears. There was no track titles ever on these songs (if you can even call these songs), so now over 20 years later there has been some kind of progression, but mildly and not very satisfying way.\n● Sixth Set and Eighth Set both has Two Parts, but the first part on both of these tracks are very short, so more likely just intros (that´s why no name, just a line). This is of course not very important information, but now you know. Better not to share with anyone anyway (as you may already know if you are still reading this).\n● All this material was recorded with Tascam four-track recorder. Improvised and in experimental mind states (both good and bad, sometimes somewhere between), using electric guitar, distortions, effect pedals, electronics, percussions, vocals, accordion, acoustic guitar, mandolin, flutes, samples, electric keyboard, and probably couple of other things. Mixed and edited in 2018 (together with many tapes of the unreleased kongkong-material, re-edited and mastered in 2023 for this release).\n● Discography available here:\nwww.discogs.com/artist/927393-Kongkong\n▐ ▀ ▐ ▀ ▐ ▀ ▐ ▀ ▐ ▀ ▐ ▀\nCassette copies available at:\nmagmatones.blogspot.com/p/shop.html\n12 copies made, dubbed to recycled cassettes.

Recorded in Finland circa 2004, but it could be from some secret area from Russia around 1954 (at least in someone's imagination in a lack of vitamins). Songs are short as is the album itself - so it's actually an EP, or mini-album or whatever you like to call it.\" - Lactofermented Subconsciousness\nLSUB-018\nlactofermentedsubconsciousness.blogspot.com",

The recordings of this album started already in 2010, but it took almost 10 years before it was fully finished (but there was also many years when \"nothing\" really happened). It was recorded & mixed partially in Chantepie (France), Brisbane (Australia), Kotka, Helsinki and Turku (Finland).\nMuuton Koto's music is a colourful psychedelic folk; with a mix of sweet lullabies and stranger experimental noises. Several electric and acoustic instruments were used and modified. Melodies and abstraction.\nSleeve art \"Balduin in Wonderland\" made by Johannes Schebler.\n└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘└┘",

            "about": "This compilation album compiles together Uton's tracks from the compilation albums between 2012-2016. Most of those releases have been very limited editions, or otherwise difficult to find. One previously unreleased track also included.\nTrack details:\nTracks 1-5: Energy Field Modulation; from Uton / The Gonk With A Luminous Nose / Roped Off / Sheaf & Froggatt ‎- 4-way-split cassette (Shack In The Barley Productions, 2016). Recorded in Turku (Finland), April 2016\nTrack 6 is from Death Match - 4 x CDR compilation (Inyrdisk, 2016). Recorded in 2015\nTracks 7-10 are from the split album of Uton & M. M. Peres (Salvador Records, 2014). Recorded in Joensuu (Finland), 2014.\nTrack 11 was previously released on The Devil Man compilation cassette (267 Lattajjaa, 2016). Track was titled \"Down From The North-West\" as a part of the album theme. However that compilation album was not mastered, so this Uton track was in very quiet volume comparing to the other tracks on the album.\nTracks 12-13 are from the compilation cassette New Galactic Windows (Ikuisuus, 2014). These tracks are from same session with the track 11. All recorded in 2014 - Joensuu, Finland.\nTrack 14 is from the compilation cassette Drones12 (Pai Tapes, 2016). Recorded in 2016, Turku (Finland).\nTrack 15 is from Ummet ja Lammet cassette album, released by Ikuisuus in 2015 (IKASUS-051). On that album this track is titled 'Siirto'. The reason why this track is on this compilation, is just an accident.\nTracks 16-20 are from Uton / I Am Just A Pupil / My Bizarre Bayuk - 3-way split double-CDR (S.I.N.K. CD's, 2014). Track 16 is from 2005, track 17 from 2004, track 18 from 2002 and track 19 from 2004. All recorded in Tampere, Finland (or nearby). Track 20 was originally released on compilation cassette Third Number (Hyster Tapes, 2012); recorded in 2012, Chantepie (France).\nSleeve art by Jani Hirvonen, 2018.\nLactofermented Subconsciousness / 2018\nLSUB-020\nlactofermentedsubconsciousness.blogspot.com",

            "about": "Recorded in Tampere, Finland, around March 2001. Four-track cassette recordings. Mixed and edited in 2018 (together with many tapes of the unreleased kongkong-material). Mastered in July 2024 for this release. All material previously unreleased.\nFree improv noise, made with electric guitar, effects, electronics, feedback, and various acoustic instruments and other sound sources. No synths at that time yet. The recordings of this album are mastered from the cassette, which had the text \"march 2001\" written, but some tracks might be maybe from earlier that same year. These are the last recordings under the name kongkong, just few months before Uton started.\nMore about this project, see the discography:\nwww.discogs.com/artist/927393-Kongkong\nOther kongkong albums available at  uton.bandcamp.com\nSleeve art by Kryptinen Käki. Sounds and production by Jani Hirvonen.\nReleased by Deep State Records\nDEEP-13",

            "about": "Originally released on vinyl LP by Dekorder (Dekorder025) in 2008.\nRecorded in Monninkylä, Finland - June-July 2007.\nReview from Norman Records:\n\"This record is sending me brilliantly insane. It's by some Finnish drone merchant called Uton who's gone to India, right, & captures, beautifully, the very essence of the country in groove after gibbering groove of tribal scree, rural farmyard noise, street market chaos, found sound, psychedelic wibbles, improvised noise, cerebral free jams, organic mantras....oh it's a real jawdropping spiritual journey is this record! It's called 'Straight Edge XXS' and is on Dekorder but belongs just as much on Sun City Girls' national audio geographic Sublime Frequencies imprint, such is the quality of the recordings and the sense of discovery on show here. Even the more chaotic, jumbled sections provide an inner peace for me as it's very expressive, surprisingly cohesive & deliciously otherworldly. It also makes me think of an unreleased soundtrack to a film by Alejandro Jodorowsky, especially, or Werner Herzog. The 2nd Finnish record this week that's utterly moved me! Ltd LP only with a fascinating collage sleeve. Wonderful sounds, the music of life & mad as a box of frogs to boot!\"",

Other artists at the same evening were Rulla, Hinageshi Bondage and Schizoide.\nThis album was originally released on CDR by Ikuisuus (IS-001) in 2005. First copies (around 35-40) came with a hand-painted disc in a hand-painted cardboard sleeve. The main edition was around 150-200 copies. Album was released digitally in 2011 by Om Ha Sva Ha Ksha Ma La Va Ra Yam (OM-41), and it was available at Free Music Archive over 10 years.\n* Additional notes: The album was slighly remastered and edited for this new version. Few seconds of the audience sounds were removed from the beginning, and few more seconds from the end (applauses). Also one cut part from the end part was fixed with a crossfade, so there´s no more the strange emptiness at some point.\nSleeve art edited and reworked in November 2022 by Jani Hirvonen.\nwww.discogs.com/release/893905-Uton-Suoniin-Luihin-Ytimiin",

            "about": "Cassette edition released by UNREAD RECORDS (Pittsburgh, USA),\nNovember 2020.\nwww.unread-records.com/releases/unread265.html\n*** *** ***\nThis album was recorded in Turku, Finland - July 2016. All recorded, mixed, produced etc by UTON.\nOriginally released digitally only by OM HA SVA HA KSHA MA LA VA RA YAM / OM-64\nomhasvahakshamalavarayam.blogspot.fi\n*** *** ***\nRecording notes:\nFirst step: recording outside in a park (sounds of creaky swings, chains of the swings) and on balcony with toys (creaky wheels of cars and tractors, lentil protection of a camera). Second step: editing step 1 recodings. Third step: Recording layers of synth & other electronic sounds. Fourth step: Mixing it all. Fifth step: out of tune radio recordings. Fifth step: Mastering. Sixth step: Uploading to Bandcamp. Seventh step: Sharing it to others. Voilà!\n*** *** ***\n\"Listening through a dense sonic medium is like walking in the surf. Moments in time slowed with viscous properties of flowing milieus. The crash of a wave or the stillness of an inland sea, each condition creating its own beauty and uniqueness. Time connects in this space, origins of life, food for people, journeys begin, and space capsules end, all interacting with a massive molecular energy spanning the axis of all dimensions. Taajuuksia Taaempaa resonates in this fluid domain. Droning sounds of distant stillness moving though thoughts. This subtle energy is filled with eddies of swirling electronics that connect and disperse or sometimes crescendo only to begin again. The sonic process is mystifying like Uton has always been.\nTaajuuksia Taaempaa seeps into the consciousness. From the opening track Esiaste, sounds patiently fill the cracks and crevices of the mind. Between the lengthy pieces, Uton has included brief interludes of electronic interference. Crackling radio waves from points in history or alternate dimension. Then the return to the depths all form of space creates. Is the unrecognizable beautiful? When hearing Taajuuksia Taaempaa, the listener will consider this question. This aural landscape is completely foreign and to this point undiscovered. Fortunately the plains and plateaus Uton crosses require a developed listening fortitude. The melodic beauty and translucent rhythms are guides in a journey for those ready for deep listening. In a brief synopsis, Taajuuksia Taaempaa holds eight lengthy selections, all far removed from any familiar sonic spectrum. These pieces are separated with small traverses of the radio dial between clearer reception. The entire composition is waiting to escort thoughts to beautifully remarkable new dimensions. Uton has twenty plus years of experience and a massive body of work to guide you safely.\nOriginally released digitally in 2016. Unread Records & Tapes has worked with Uton to bring Taajuuksia Taaempaa in to cassette physical format. Amazingly this is number 265 for Unread, a label flowing out release like a spring tapped into the aquifer. Releasing sounds for over twenty five years, Unread needs to be named a geologic event in the music world. Uton needs the same.\" - LOST IN A SEA OF SOUND",

            "about": "Album was released originally on cd-r by Finnish label 267 Lattajjaa (2004), and it came in 5 different sleeve versions by Pia Renwall. Recorded in Tampere, Finland, August 2004.\nTracks 11 and 12 are from 3\"cdr \"Vanhan Päivän Jumalat\", originally released by Foxglove, and recorded in Tampere, Finland, early 2004.\n\"On The August Light, Uton shows us a new side of his ever-evolving project. This album is bathed in the pine-scented forests of the north, touched by a spiritual, unspoken presence.\nThis latest CD-R on the mighty 267-Lattajjaa imprint explores the mystical world that exists outside of most cities. It is a place where Mother Nature is the dominating force, watching over all her tree children and glacial palaces. These 10 untitled tracks are a dreamlike journey. They go to places that could only exist in your mind and reveal things that your unconscious doesn't want you to know. Within these mossy walls exists a dark world that is aching for the light. It's a place where dark hunter greens long to live the way of the flourescent realm of colors.\nSolemn electronic drones rise and fall from beneath the coniferious canopy. Organic instrumentation finds its way between the seams, acting as the glue that holds this entire arbor symphony together. Uton's in his element here. This is music that is cerebral while also being accessible. The organic instruments do their part in keeping these album from feeling too distant. It's like walking through a mystical, almost-frightening world, but carrying some piece of home with you that keeps you feeling safe & warm. The August Light is a neverending search for some unspeakable truth. Uton is looking for rebirth.\nThis is an album that unfolds on many levels simultaneously. As it creeps along slowly, ghostly voices rise through the murky keyboards, guitars, and recorders, illuminating the way through this forest. The August Light is brilliant, in approach and in execution. Uton has impressed me a lot over the past few years, but never as much as he does on this release. The August Light is his finest hour\" - Brad Rose / Foxy Digitalis",

            "about": "This album got it's inspiration and influence from the historical (but well hidden from the big public) story of Rabbi Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676), the false messiah, and his Sabbatean cult, which was later continued by Jacob Frank (1726-1791), who managed with his followers to infiltrate many important people, secret societies, banks, religions, governments - to control the citizens, and to begin the New World Order. We can see their influence in a modern world, politics, media and culture. They are the dark cult behind the curtains; if not the one and only, but one of the main things - even today! Their tentacles are widely spreaded, and together with Catholic church, Jesuit Order, Communists, Nazis, Zionists and other propaganda systems (such as governments) humanity is in a great danger to be transformed to soulless and dark beings, as the psychopatic \"master plan\" is sucking the freedom and wisdom away. This is a great subject for anyone to dig deeper and to see how's the world functioning.\nThe album starts from The Preparation. The time before Sabbatai Zevi (the false messiah) and his Sabbatean satanic cult. Zevi was inspired by Isaac Luria's modern new Kabbalah, which got it's influence from the Jesuit Order's Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), and finally got the updated blessings from Nathan of Gaza.\nThere's plenty of material about Sabbatai Zevi, Jacob Frank, and their dark cult, which is called Sabbateanism, Frankism, or Sabbatean-Frankism (depending who is speaking). It's strongly recommended to read Robert Sepehr's book \"Redemption Through Sin\", which was also the main source for this album's concept. Definetely a good way to start the journey into this deep and important subject.\n***\nThe creation of this album started in October 2020 and finished in December 2020. The original idea was to release it with a booklet including the historical story about this subject, but finally the time wasn't ever right for that, and finally the whole booklet idea wasn't anymore the thing, and there was problems to find out if it would be realistic to release this album on CD by some \"real\" label. Finally this idea was skipped and moved to the possible later time, and some new better mixes were also made at some times. In the end as it was already 3 years since the beginning of this project, I finally thought to release this digitally. I am still open for a CD release (and for that booklet... if I would get help from a writer who could assembly the text logically for such a release).\nThe album was recorded mainly with Arturia Minibrute and Korg Minilogue XD. All sounds and production by Jani Hirvonen. Final mastering in December 2023.",

            "about": "Violin improvisation recordings from 2007, mostly from November (only the first track is from October, and even in its last day). Tracks 1 & 2 previously released on cassette \"Violin Massage Vol. 2\" (OMS-B, 2008), and tracks 4 & 6 on cassette \"Violin Massage Vol. 3\" (Cabin Floor Esoterica, 2009).\nRecorded in Monninkylä (Askola, Finland). Mastered in February 2025, Turku, Finland. All sounds and production by Jani Hirvonen.\n--- These recordings are continuing the style of Violin Massage album, which was recorded in India, earlier in 2007 (and released on triple-CDr). Total freeform exploration, and not even trying to follow the rules of music. --- More likely just getting out from all the written rules how the music should be, and to write the rules again with updated information. (Of course this type of free improvisation has been existing already much earlier, so nothing totally new was not invented with these recordings. But the angle is fresh). ---\n--- The main thing on these improvisations is the freedom of expression, in a frame which a violin gives, together with the inner pulse and intention to dive deeper into the unknown (or forgotten and buried spiritual realms), sometimes (or mostly) in a very stubborn way. --- It may not be easy to listen, but give it a chance, and let's see what happens.\n***\nReleased in 28th February 2025. In Finnish calendar it's the Finnish Culture Day - and also Kalevala Day (national epic).\nDon't forget the official extension \"Violin Improvisation 19.1.2008\" single:\nuton.bandcamp.com/album/violin-improvisation-1912008\n***\nMagma Tones / MGTN45",

            "about": "Originally released on vinyl LP by Dekorder (Dekorder037) in 2009.\nRecorded in Monninkylä, Finland - May 2008.\nReview by Norman Records:\n\"The 3rd vinyl LP from Uton has landed on the ever good useful Dekorder label called 'Unexplained Objects'. I'm not massively familiar with this Finnish chap's work but what I have heard has been pretty bonkers. This sounds even more bonkers than previous outings. It sounds like some kind of weird crazy forest folk played in outer space by small aliens with brightly coloured patchwork clothes wielding small very very very powerful weapons. That's a very precise image that it conjures up but that is what I get. That's the power of music... Shut your eyes and listen and wait for the images to appear.... That's why listening to such a crazed album like this appeals as it can help your mind take you all over the place. It's instrumental so it's less folk than a lot of the varied folk scene of Finland but it's definitely got that twisted vibe that they do so well. It comes in a suitably appropriate sleeve designed by Uton themselves. You should check out the pic of Uton on Discogs as it appears to be a tree playing a guitar. Nice...\"",

            "about": "Released on double-cassette by Ikuisuus, January 2022\nEdition of 50 copies.\nThe cassette set comes with a 12-page booklet and insert sheet.\nikuisuus.bandcamp.com\n◯◯◯\n\"This is music from the mythical dreamland, where the stories from another realms are living their reality like they have always lived, freely in an endless space. These stories, colours, sounds and visions are connected to our DNA, to our soul and memory. It´s the area where we are all connected, in a spiritual union with this multidimensional existence, which we project daily to our everyday world\"\nMost of the sounds on this album were made with Korg Minilogue XD synthesizer. Only very few digital additions were included to some selected parts. All music and production by UTON / Jani Hirvonen. Recorded between January-May 2021.\nAI text-to-image prompts written by Jack Vater.\nLayout by Kryptinen Käki.\n◯◯◯",
