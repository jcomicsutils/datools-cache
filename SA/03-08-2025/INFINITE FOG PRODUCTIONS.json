            "about": "Present to your attention the physical embodiment of a new album by the remarkable Russian band “ПомниИмяСвое” (\"Pomni Imya Svoye\") it could be translated as “Remember Your Name”. The album is called \"Sky and Stone\"; it contains ten songs - one song more than the digital version of the album.\nAt this time only one song based on the poem of S. Yesenin, but the texts of five songs written by vocalist Ksenia Fandeeva!\nMoreover, on the plate you will find the songs on poems by Eduardo Carranza, Robert Rozhdestvensky, Dmitry Kachmar and Vladimir Vysotsky.\n“Pomni Imya Svoye - it is bizarre and melodious songs, sad and anxious, hysterical and almost hopeless. It is a living Russian word, as native and clear, deep and simple, as life itself.\nI hear the groan of the field. It sings how people lived and died on this earth, how loved and betrayed. Born again and again dying. Dying to be born and born to die.\nI hear the voice of the wind. It is the whisper and laughter of generations. They mingled and sounded in my ears, like a cry of joy and a cry of pain.\nThis is a song in which I recognize myself”\nBand members:\nKsenia - vocal, piano, music, poetry\nStas - piano, guitar, music\nMaria – Accordion\nCity - Orel\n—\n“Pomni Imya Svoye is one of the most sincere and penetrating commands, dared to combine in their music poetic Russian word and chilling funeral chants. Pure and deep female voice reaches to the innermost meaning of human life.\nIt looks into the soul, and brings to the surface the pain and joy, confusion and anguish, jumping up to scream, going to a whisper.\nPiano is a stress-minimalistic. Sometimes it sounds extremely hopeless, echoing the stringy and wide accordion part.\nIt all exists in some distinctive harmony of music and text, feeling and rhythm. This music is a fusion of simplicity and eternity, where kindly, and hurt, and gently heard the song.”",

            "about": "With joy conscious that the magic of the amazing Neo-Classical band REMEMBERED YOUR NAME did not stop happening, IFP presents the third studio album, already known to the listener under the name \"OTHER\".\nAs with the previous album, the edition is made in two versions: super limited-edition Digibook with two discs - on the second one you can listen to 6 instrumental compositions united in the album \"Loneliness\". And the regular version in Digipak, the circulation of which is also quite limited, 300 copies!\nOn \"OTHER\" you'll find 9 tracks. The band, which is very happy, continued the beginning of the last album and part of the lyrics from the songs - their own compositions. In addition to them on the record, you can hear work on the poems of I. Brodsky, V. Toka, O. Skorokhodov, O. Pas, R. Rozhdestvensky.\nObviously, it's no exaggeration to say that \"OTHER\" is one of the main musical albums of the outgoing year, especially in the Russian-speaking segment.\n__________________\nС радостью осознавая, что магия удивительной отечественной группы ПОМНИ ИМЯ СВОЁ не прекратила твориться, IFP представляет издание третьего студийного альбома, уже известного слушателю под названием \"ИНЫЕ\".\nКак и с предыдущим альбомом, издание осуществлено в двух вариантах коллекционный лимитированный Дигибук с двумя дисками — на втором можно послушать 6 инструментальных композиций, объединенных в альбом «Одиночество». И регулярная версия в Digipak, тираж которой тоже довольно сильно ограничен, 300 копий!\nНа Иных 9 композиций. Группа, что очень радует, продолжила начинание прошлого альбома и часть стихов из песен — собственного сочинения. Кроме них на пластинке можно услышать работы на стихи И. Бродского, В. Тока, О. Скороходова, О. Паса, Р. Рождественского.\nОчевидно, не преувеличением будет сказать, что \"Иные\" один из главных музыкальных альбомов уходящего года, особенно в русскоязычном сегменте.",

            "about": "If there's a name to remember in the Chinese black ambient scene, it's definitely Enemite. The obscure project of Sir Li Chao, well known for his projects Evilthorn and Zaliva-D, Enemite or \"Yuan\" in Chinese, is a concentration of feelings, hate, frustration, and sensations loud and oppressive.Developing a universe, his universe, a symbol of his spirit,\nsick and sickening. He shared a first CD with Zhou Rong on the label Dying Art Productions before releasing Wuyuan, his crowning achievement, in 2005. It would be just about impossible to recreate on stage the emotion of the album, so Enemite prefers not to endanger the integrity of what he intended to share with us, with them, by performing lives. The project now ended, Enemite has made with just a few tracks a true feat.\n\"巫怨 is an album by the Chinese musician 怨 (almost always mistranslated to Enemite)巫怨 is an album by the Chinese musician 怨 (almost always mistranslated to Enemite) first time released on the label Dying Art Productions in 2005.\nThis is a dark ambient album with some really nice things going on. The release sounds heavily inspired by traditional Chinese music and black metal. This album has a very awesome combination of dark sounding traditional music combined with more normal dark ambient. The traditional elements give it a very nice sound and sounds like the music for some demonic entity in Ancient China. Lots of the release is accompanied by black metal-esque vocals\nwhich helps add to the demonic vibes.\" - obscuremusicdaily.\n---\n\"What is it about the Eastern scene that continues to instigate horrific imagery and soundscapes among us?Enemite's \"Wuyuan\" is a 8 track opus of Ritual Ambience, hailing from China. Released on the underground \"Dying Art\" label, \"Wuyuan\" is exactly what the sicker minded ambient lovers will long for.\nAfter the deceivingly calm intro, the sickness kicks in, and the soundtrack to a disgusting nightmare is unleashed. Gongs, distorted windpipes, repulsive vocals and a very distinctive eastern sound carry this release. At times, the sound goes from the shrillest and most intimate of ambient soundscapes to the most necrotic and vile vocals imaginable. Indeed, it's as if the vocals were literally vomited out.\nSadly, the artwork and inlays aren't legible to those of you who don't speak native Mandarin. Fortunately, the fascinating but eerie inlay gives us enough insight as to what to expect with this release anyway.\nYou can almost sit back and imagine yourself laid on an icy cold mortuary table, with a circle of men approaching you with ceremonial knives. The music on this release really is that effective.\n\"Wuyuan\" really is not comparable to anything else from its genre; as usual, the Chinese scene provides us once again with something as twisted and unorthodox as anyone could want to imagine.\nDisturbing, eerie as hell, but outright Genius.\nHighly, Highly reccomended.\" - Heathen Harvest.",

            "about": "The final and complete anthology of ZOS KIA recordings known under title “23” now released on limited vinyl set with different artwork and remastered especially for vinyl by Martin Bowes(Attrition) on The Cage Studio. For this important part of industrial music history, we prepared two different version:\n- DE LUXE 3LP Triple-Gatefold Set, limited to 450 copies.\n- COLLECTORS BOX EDITION – extremely limited, special manufactured wooden box with the reproduction of Austin Osman Spare’s picture. Limited 23 copies.\nThis edition includes the DE LUXE 3LP Triple-Gatefold Set in a specially-designed wooden box with fixings on the reverse that allows the box to be hung on a wall. The box is easy opens by removing a strut on the top edge so that the cover and records can be accessed without removing the box from the wall.\n~\nZOS KIA was formed by John Gosling (MEKON), John Balance (COIL) and Min – with guest Peter ‘Sleazy’ Christopherson (THROBBING GRISTLE). Their one and only long-play album, Transparent, was released August 23rd, 1983 in a cassette the only edition on the now-defunct Nekrophile label, Austria. They were the first released recordings of both COIL and ZOS KIA. It was reissued years later by COIL (Threshold House / Eskaton) in an edited edition. Later, 2017, the entire recordings were reissued on CD/vinyl via COLD SPRING RECORDS. Definitely, “Transparent” one of the most legendary and important industrial releases of all times. But beside of “Transparent”, ZOS KIA released 2 EP vinyl and record several tracks for compilation as well as about an hour of unreleased material which was found in John Gosling archives.\nNow the final and complete anthology of ZOS KIA recordings released under title “23” on 3LP in DELUXE Triple-Gatefold Set via INFINITE FOG PRODUCTIONS. 23 tracks, more than 2 hours of exciting material in various styles, was сarefully extracted and prepared for publishing by John Gosling himself, and artwork was done by Cold Graves. Well-known track in different forms, unknown, rare and unreleased composition, and many more for the deep diving into the esoteric underground music from 80th.\n“23” is the long-awaited release for those who deeply in the old-school industrial music, collectors, rare-searchers and especially great gift for all COIL lovers.",

            "about": "Ad Lux Tenebrae, one of the most interesting phenomena in Russian ritual/drone music, have proven themselves as uplifters of first-class ritual sound. Each of their few works, is the fruit of serious musical practices, long-term loneliness, and consequently, the identity, the roots of which can also be seen in an unusual tools and authors. Great powerful sounds from primeval Ural woods. To create music they use original musical instruments - bubens, handmade drums, blowing horns, flutes and other instruments which have no name made by the musicians themselves. The CD contains two live recorded rituals, each of them was played in this form only once and never will be repeated. \"Ouroboros\" was recorded with the assistance of Podonok (Nuclear Winter). Sound design by 121 (Closing the Eternity/Velehentor). Ltd x 170 (!!) copies only, with artwork by Artem Grigoriev.",

Simple compositions of a darkwave fame with a nostalghic old school CMI sound. An overall goth atmosphere is executed by a mature talent, so it never gets cheesy. The folky chants enrich suspense milieu with a strange romantic sensation and the whole album turns into a precious present by a beloved from the past.",

            "about": "The music released as Amulet (or The Amulet Edition) is Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson's semi-secret testament. Originally available in exceedingly limited quantities at live shows and via direct mail-order in 2008 as a hand-assembled 4 miniCDR set housed in a circular Thai Amulet case and never properly distributed, the material finally receives the wider re-release on vinyl and CD it so richly deserves.\nOnly the second and sadly already the final release in his post-Coil solo guise as The Threshold Houseboys Choir \"Amulet\" sees Christopherson in a more playful mood than ever, don't be fooled by reviews calling this suite of songs \"incomplete\" or \"working stage\", these are rough little diamonds, often imbued with a bittersweet melancholy joy, unsurprisingly reminiscent of some of the final Coil offerings, but additionally steeped in exotica, inspired by his new East Asian home and the ghostly voices of his digitally generated choir (\"a vocalist that wouldn't crash\", as he would say). At times these tracks sound like a warmer, less analytically complex counterpart to the work he created simultaneously with CoH's Ivan Pavlov in the celebrated Soisong project.\nBonus tracks feature rare earlier THBC compilation tracks and a few previously unreleased exclusive sketches. Let's be perfectly clear though, \"Amulet\" is not some half-finished cutting-room floor left-overs, it's a genuine but very little heard fully fledged album released by Christopherson with some of the tracks performed live on his last ever tour, the unforgettable intimate Evenings with Uncle Sleaz.\nThe Infinite Fog edition, presented as a 3LP in a triple heavy Gatefold sleeve and a 2CD Digipak, both including a poster of Peter Christopherson in his infamous Cruella Deville coat has been respectfully and expertly remastered by grammy-nominated Jessica Thompson. Artwork by Oleg Galay overseen and with additional guidance from \"our man in Thailand\" Peter Jenx.",

            "about": "IFP happy to announce one of the most important ambient reissues on the year, a pure gem of early ambient music.\nMichael Stearns is a multi-genre music composer and soundtrack designer/producer. His credits include music for Ron Fricke's non-verbal 70MM films \"Chronos\", \"Baraka\" and \"Samsara\", music for NASA, Laserium, Disney films, HBO, ABC, PBS, BBC, Discovery Channel and James Cameron's \"The Abyss\", \"Titanic\" and \"Avatar\". Michael works in his studio \"The Guest House\", in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\nIn 1975, Michael moved from Tucson to Los Angeles to study with Emilie Conrad at the Continuum Studio. Emilie had ‘live’ music for her ‘movement meditation’ classes, and Michael began performing with Fred Stofflet, Gary David, and Don Preston. Ancient Leaves (25:43) was Michael’s first album, recorded in 1976/77 with a Mini Moog synthesizer and a Finish lap harp (Kantele) onto 4 track tape. To the other instruments, Michael added Emilie chanting, an ascending choir with Susan Harper and Linda Olsen vocalists, Gregorian Chants and a night ambience recorded in the desert outside of Tucson, Arizona, his hometown. It was initially released on LP and cassette.\nThe ‘B’ side, Elysian E (23:13) was performed with an Arp String Ensemble played through an MXR digital delay, one of the first then slowed to half speed. To this, he added Moog and EML synthesizers, The Beam and his voice.\nREVIEWS:\n\"A later 70’s California New Age record that has a much more spacey sound than most. Reminds me a whole lot of the first few Klaus Schulze solo lp’s. Two side-long cosmic drones consisting of layered electronics and hypnotic wordless voices. Stearns’ best record by far. \"  waxidermy.com\n\"Probably the earliest example of modern (electronic) ambient—divorced from piano minimalism, guitar wankery, jazz, New Age cheese, or whatever—it's mostly just deep, dark synthesizer drones here. Ancient Leaves was simply ahead of its time. This was Michael Stearns' first album, and I think it's his best, although most people seem to prefer either Planetary Unfolding or Encounter, which admittedly are excellent as well. Regardless, it's undeniable that Ancient Leaves is a landmark album and Michael Stearns is clearly one of the main pioneers of ambient music; it amazes me this guy is never mentioned in the same breath as Eno et al. E.g. Ancient Leaves was never released on CD until 1999. 1999! It's ridiculous how little attention this guy's music gets, even among ambient aficionados. I think he definitely deserves more than that.\" - dvd muze\n\"5.0 out of 5 stars! The Finest \"Growth\" Tool I've Ever Had!\nThis is a treasure!! Ancient Leaves enters your very soul and, if listened to in its entirety, in one sitting, will give you a vehicle on which to travel to the very depths of your mine. I used this CD for a number of years for meditation and discovery...Believe what you will, but I \"traveled\" through a learning process not available anywhere else but in your own mind and soul. I would go on and on, but what I would want to convey is difficult to convey is not possibly translated into words. Each listener, I'm very sure will have his/her extremely personal experience of expansion and growth. What I truly love about Mr. Stearns accomplishment with Ancient Leaves is that it gave me a journey \"out\" or deeply \"in\" (whichever way you wish to translate it), allowed me to SAFELY explore and grow...and then carefully and gently led me back to my body and present \"reality\". I have compared my \"journeys\" on Stearns music with my husband's amazing journeys using large does of LSD and we found that not only were my discoveries equally expanding and deep, but I \"returned\" much more easily, maintaining the knowledge and wisdom that I had gained. My experience with this music occurred when it was first released on cassette tape. I would and will still use it as my inspiration as soon as I find a CD. \"- Anchild\n~\n-no audio, only physical release.",

            "about": "AGHAST; NEBELHEXE – these names are known to almost every fan of folk; ambient and metal music. All of them were created by amusician, a righter and an artist Andrea Nebel Haugen – a really cult person, exiting stage with each new work. We are glad to present you the first album released by Andrea under her own name. She started this album by creating music to her book with short stories. The result of two years of work is charming, melodic Dark Ambient and unforgettable voice of Andrea who tells stories of the book. If dreams mean for you more than just some rest of your body between two days, if work of Andrea touched your hart, than words are superfluous, sincerity and beauty of her work attract themselves…\nThe perfect soundtrack for your darkest nights…CD released as A5 Digipak, with a booklet containing all the stories. The sophisticated design complted by Federico Salvador (All me faith lost...).\nWe continue our policy of really limited editions and this one issued just 300 copies.\n---\n\"Experiencing this record is like reading Andréa Nebel's diary she desires to share. A myriad of emotions is being summoned: from heavenly on \"In My Dreams I'm Free\" to bestial on \"My Vampire\", to morbid ephemeral on \"Ghostlover\", to Victorian fin de siècle on \"Some Time Ago We Did Meet\", to stunningly dreamlike on a flawless \"Late...\", to paranoid on \"Sometimes\" or \"Fear\". Simple compositions, true feelings of a person who dwells on \"The Dark Side Of Dreaming\" and is \"Proud\" of an absolutely detached, self-centred, aloof oneself.\" - Old Captain",

            "about": "Many of us remember Tamerlan by his dark folk/ritual album – \"Ain\" recorded with such guests as Cecilia Bjärgö(Arcana) and Tony Wakeford(Sol Invictus). Timur(mastermind of the project) sent us the \"Ain\" demo at the end of 2013 during our vacation and it was the main soundtrack of the trip those days. By returning to the office I contacted Timur, but it was too late as the album was already signed by cult French Black Metal label Debemur Morti Productions.\nTen years later we're happy to release a small jewel, Tamerlan's new mini album. Only digital and only free/tell your price. Add it to your collection and enjoy Tamerlan's deep ritual folk compositions.\n~\nTimur says:\n\"If we put my ideas regarding the direction of this project into numbers, they will be significantly higher than all the plays of its songs combined. Yet, putting any into motion, and seeing them realized before me had never provided the full sense of content. Just a short-term comfort – a mere good night's sleep below the stars, rather than a full-fledged home in which the very heart of Tamerlan can reside, raising its roof higher and higher with each beat.\nFinally, it dawned upon me! All these years I’d been looking around, but never had I stopped to look deep inside, the roots...the origins...My roots! Coming back to Siberia, my birthplace, with that desire, has finally opened my senses. And for the first time ever I could really see through the eyes of what this project was always meant to be! I could hear it in the wind, the vast taigas, the endless rivers...they all spoke to me with the voice many of us call “God”. All I had to do was listen and create...and with that, I could already see the walls of home forming!\n“Animist” might be short in its nature, but it represents the gate and pathway to this home. Furthermore, it is a gratitude to all ideas, directions, and forces prior. While not all of them worked as intended, each of them aided me on this journey.\nNow I am here, mentally, physically, and spiritually. With three compositions presented on this EP, I complete the old and embark on a new voyage. This time, keeping the heart of Tamerlan in the exact right place!\" - Tamerlan",

            "about": "Being an explanation of the METGUMBNERBONE C.D. “ANTHROPOLOGICAL FIELD RECORDINGS FOR THE DISPOSSESSED”. This two TAPE set comprises of three previously released tracks selected from “DREUN” and two tracks from “LIGELIAHORN”, seven tracks that have only been available as bad quality bootlegs, which would have comprised the never released “FOR THE RAVEN”, three tracks taken from the compilations ARCHANGELS OF SEX RULE DEATH TO THE REGIME (although a slightly different version being the original live recording before gongs were added), SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS and INTERCHANGE and seven other previously unreleased tracks newly brought up and dusted down from the METGUMBNERVAULTS. Two and one half hours of top quality METGUMBNERBONE enough to satisfy the most hardcore 'bone head! .\nThese events were all recorded in the early to mid eighties on low quality portable cassette machines so the sound quality cannot realistically be compared to modern studio recordings or, indeed, most recordings from back then! They were recorded in a number of different locations, the environment being part of the sound. Disused bitumen silos, abandoned railway tunnels, ruins of industry, caverns and caves or outdoors in woods and by the sea. The tracks CHTHONIC and AES SIDHE may sound like they have a lot of tape hiss on them to the uninformed ear but it is actually the sound of an underground river. Urban, and indeed, rural exploration was always as much a part of the METGUMBNERBONE ethos as was the musicks extracted there from.\nI've no idea what you would class it as? Experimental Dark Ambient Industrial Folk Horror? The sounds range from the sublime to the ridiculous, both joyful and mournful by turns. Often fragile, delicate and teetering on the edge of total collapse. Sounding in some instances like the fumbling invention of music or, perhaps, therapy for the unhinged. Hopefully they set the imagination wandering amidst the phantasmagoria of their enactment.\n: THE DRAGON SLAYS ST. GEORGE :",

            "about": "The dark, atmospheric and energetic mix of choirs, strings, various FX-sounds, heavy drums, and tribal sections makes this the seed for the raison d’etre sound trademark that began with the album 'Prospectus I' from 1993. Released in 1992 'Apres Nous Le Deluge' became the first official output from raison d'etre when it went available on the Cold Meat Industry subsidiary label Sound Source.\nThere are three versions of 'Apres Nous Le Deluge' and now they have finally all been joined into one complete album release: the Trinity Edition. The original version released on cassette in 1992, first as a private demo tape and soon after slightly slimmed officially on the Cold Meat Industry sub-label Sound Source, had many flaws in the recording quality due to bad equipment and poor skills. The remixed version from 1995 was an attempt to make things better. It was a try to recreate the whole album but the mission failed. Only about half of the tracks were possible to recreate and the second half was just the original version treated with equalization and reverb. Also, many sounds on the remixed tracks were missing thus replaced with new sounds. In 2012 there was a new more serious attempt to recreate the whole album. The intention with the reduxed version was to recreate the energy and feeling of the original version but still making it well balanced and clear in the mix.",

To celebrate this album, in 2017 Ataraxia have recorded three exclusive tracks (written in 1989/1992) never released before. These old but new tracks keep the spirit of the 90ies with a nowadays feeling. Nicolas Ramain took care of the layout and design. Thanks Nick for the album cover as well! The picture is by Mick Mercer.",

Here we are just musicians playing airs that make you dance and cry at the same time, and while doing this we say to ourselves: “Take your bloody knife and start exploring your killing nature, be not politically correct, sing and play as a fucking gorgon if you wish and have fun.\"",

            "about": "SUENOS ('Dreams' in Spanish) is the title of the long-time sold out and eagerly awaited album by ATARAXIA but the onomatopoeic sound reminds also of the English words for 'signs' and 'sounds'. It has been recorded in 2000/2001 year and originally released by Cruel Moon International (Cold Meat Industry).\nFor the first time in ATARAXIA's history this album is not a conceptual album but a collection of new songs with different styles, themes, with different historical backgrounds and many acoustic new instruments. The album has been divided into three parts of 4 songs each: the first (‘Ego Promitto Domino’) features lyrics inspired by journeys and remembrances of mid-eastern lands. The sounds are between neo classical, orchestral for 4 voices and Mediterranean dreamy ambiances. The second part (‘L’ame d’eau’) is entirely based on Medieval ballads just for acoustic instruments and 2 voices and the Third part (‘Sandy Dunes’) finally is more intimate and meditative, once again the theme is the one of water linked to the female soul: The voyage through the sea, regret, the need of the sea. Just for Francesca’s heavenly vocals...\nMore then 10 years later, Ataraxia & Infinite fog Production presents new, completely remastered edition with special bonus track “Melisanda” - Rare song “Melisanda” was released on split-vinyl Ataraxia/Engelsstaub - “In Amoris Mortisque” 95 but carefully remastered now.",

            "about": "Limited to 292 copies((by the number of days in Autumn season).) CD version - sold out.\n~\n\"Inorganic Blossoming\" is a collaboration between two musicians from cold Siberia — Becoming and Freeall. Both have composed soundtracks for short films, music for theatre productions, and created audio for commercials.\nTheir album \"Autumndrones\" is best understood as an expression of love for autumn. They didn’t want to dedicate music to the season — they wanted to write it.\nThat’s why the music was composed exclusively during autumn, and when the season ended, they left the unfinished material untouched until the next fall. The process took three years.\nAlmost all the sounds you hear were recorded naturally — these are real autumn sounds. The entire mood of the album was shaped by the season: even the live instruments, such as violin and accordion, were recorded outdoors, in the fields, alongside the rustling of leaves.\nIt’s well known that the more you observe something, the more you influence it.\nIn the same way, those who truly listen will hear the sound of the woods, the whispers of the leaves, the steps, and then — the breath.\nThis album is a reunification of autumn and the human response to it — nature and the human merged in sound.\nAnd the human voice is barely present: there is no aggression, no technogenic force. Only an echo — faint and almost vanishing in the autumn wind — reminds us that someone was here.\n\"Autumndrones\" is a 28-minute album consisting of three compositions — a blend of soft ambient, delicate noise, and accidental melodies.\nA mix of rustling leaves, wind, and the song of analog synthesizers.\nIt is melancholy, stillness, and infinity.",

            "about": "Infinite Fog are delighted to present another piece of the intriguing COIL puzzle. In the mid 1990s the core team of John Balance and Peter Christopherson were continuing their exploration of the outer reaches of electronic sound production as exemplified by the \"Born Again Pagans\" release, originally an EP only, featuring both the hugely danceable \"Protection\" smash which had Danny Hyde's influence writ in large letters all over it, as well as the first outings of their intriguing more ambient/glitch-based ElpH material, probably their most haunting and haunted works. This new 3LP/2CD anthology re-edition collects all of the ElpH material which didn't appear on their later \"Worship the Glitch\" album, namely the pHILM #1 10\", a host of very rare compilation tracks as well as a number of at the time unreleased pieces in the same vein. The stunningly presented release also features the ElpH entity's last ever appearance originally available as part of raster noton's award winning 20' to 2000 series of releases, the \"Zwölf\" EP.\nAll of the material has been lovingly remastered by Jessica Thompson with re-imagined design-work by Oleg Galay and including a replica of the original St. Sebastian on acid poster.",

            "about": "Please, check the DIGITAL on the artist's page:  bvdub.bandcamp.com\n~\nBvdub, also Brock Van Wey - melancholic master of large musical forms, whose discography has more than 30 solo albums.\nDuring the years of creative activity bvdub managed to occupy a special musical niche: its vast ambient-cloths, contrary to the laws of the genre, have the strongest emotional impact. Tone melodies, sensual splashes of female vocals, coming from afar and wavy bass pulsations - the basis of the musical style of bvdub.\nIn the 90's, Brock was a DJ and a party organizer in San Francisco, but already in 2004, tired of the music scene, he sold all his 7,000 records and moved to China. Here Brock settles in a small (by Chinese standards) city of Hangzhou and finds himself in the role of an English teacher at the university. At the same time, Brock takes up writing his own music. His compositions - atmospheric, often devoid of rhythm and tangibility - were not always such; At the start of his production career, Brock began with a fairly canonical dub-techno, with each following album increasingly gravitating toward ambient.\n\"A Thousand Words is my longest, largest work to date, and what we can likely all agree this was all coming to - one, single 77-minute piece. Much more than one single narrative, however, it is comprised of 19 movements, and over 500 channels of audio... all performed in one take, live.\nCombining a colossal library of pre-recorded and treated loops, samples, beds, and instrumentation, in concert with live arrangement, synthesis, loop creation, instrumentation, and even vocals, A Thousand Words is about as raw and unapologetic as anything I have ever made - as well as the most challenging, requiring more equipment, instruments, and dexterity than I have ever attempted before... as well three keyboards, six live instruments, and two samplers, all running through two computers and a phone, simultaneously.\nBut much more importantly is why I made it. A Thousand Words was borne from an amazing fact I discovered in recent times... that cats only meow to humans. They do not do so to each other, nor any other animal - but over time, have learned that this is the language with which they can communicate to people. And like with anyone, when you get to know them, you will know how much they truly have to say - they say it all, yet can do so without all the trappings, faults, and deception of people - for life is not anywhere near as complicated or unnecessarily difficult as we love to make it. It is, in essence, quite simple. And that is, in essence, quite amazing.\nOnce I started to really meditate on this idea, it began to expand to all aspects of my life... and I began to hear sound, and view communication in an entirely different light. It finally awoke in me what had laid dormant for nearly a year, as I spiraled in a black hole of manic depression and apathy toward every facet of my being, my past, and my future. I set about to not only shatter that blackness, but to do so in a way that could truly respect my even deeper love for those in my life for whom I can feel true love. Love is the willingness to do absolutely anything for the object of that love - and I am fortunate to have had, and have, several forces in my life that have let me experience pure happiness, and pure love. It just so happens that they are also, generally, those with a fairly limited vocabulary - but they say it all. You don’t have to say a lot to mean everything... and that is true for us all.\nI hope this album can help you take another look whatever source of love you have in your life... how it conveys itself to you... and how you do the same in return - and to take a moment each day to do let someone know they’re not alone. After all, without that, what do we have?\n$2 from every sale of this album will be donated to the Animal Rescue League of Berks County (PA), SPCA of Wake County (NC), and numerous fledgling rescue centers in Europe who are instituting programs that encourage children to read to cats every day after school... not only providing a massive upturn in youth literacy and love of books, but hours a day where those who have been forgotten can have someone by their side.\nWhatever form they take, don’t forget those who are there for you every day - and take a moment each day to be there for them. You don’t have to speak, but simply being there can mean a thousand words.\" - Brock Van Wey",

            "about": "Very Large Array (VLA) is a radio astronomy observatory located on the Plains of San Agustin, between the towns of Magdalena and Datil, some 50 miles (80 km) west of Socorro, New Mexico. It comprises 27 25-meter radio telescopes in a Y-shaped array and all the equipment, instrumentation, and computing power to function as an interferometer. Each of the massive telescopes is mounted on double parallel railroad tracks, so the radius and density of the array can be transformed to focus on particular bands of wavelength. Astronomers using the VLA have made key observations of black holes and protoplanetary disks around young stars, discovered magnetic filaments and traced complex gas motions at the Milky Way's center, probed the Universe's cosmological parameters, and provided new knowledge about the physical mechanisms that produce radio emission.\nThe VLA stands at an elevation of 6970 ft (2124 m) above sea level. It is a component of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).",

            "about": "Infinite Fog is happy to present this album by the wonderful Italian band. ‘Just in time’ for the long autumn nights, their quiet, intimate and melancholic music seems like a perfect introduction and preparation for the imminent colder and darker seasons. \"Chamber Music\" was recorded 10(!) years ago, and it was this work that brought the group to a contract with Cold Meat Industry. The album has actually never been released until now, purely due to copyright problems that have now finally been resolved and it is for the first time that this wonderful album can be made available to everyone into the beauty and melancholy of this act. All lyrics were taken from James Joyce's collection of poems called 'chamber music' and a release was only possible with the permission of the actual copyright owner, Joyce's nephew Stephen. This permission was denied in the past even to much ‘bigger’ artists such as Kate Bush. 10 years ago ALL MY FAITH LOST… were therefore forced to write new lyrics and re-record all vocal parts again. Basic parts of this album were in fact used for the first album ‘As you’re vanishing in silence’ (Cold Meat Industry, 2005), an album that got overwhelming feedbacks and was a big success for both the band and the label. Now 10 years after its original conception and 70 years after Joyce's death, Infinite Fog finally succeeded to get all the rights to release this album!",

            "about": "This album dedicated to the archetype of Toad in world's mythology and based on re-processed sounds of frogs, toads and swamps.I made this field recordings during my travels in China, India and Kavkaz , also i receieved a part of them from friendly sound artists as Mars F. Weillink (x-Vance Orchestra) , Andrea Marutti (Amon) and Roman Voronovski (Rombix).\nTrack 3 contains a looped voice by Dasha Baskakova and sounds recorded at Volkonski Dolmen using sine generator and dolmen original acoustic. Track 4 based on pitched loops of my violin and sounds from Mars. No any preset sounds/ synths used on this record.\n*The term \"toadstool\" was often applied to poisonous mushrooms or to those. Between 1400 and 1600 A.D., this term were used synonymously with some mushrooms of umbrella-like cap-and-stem form.\n*the myth of a Princess Frog exist in a different cultures. In Russia its a character of some russian magic tales of archaic times...Symbol of Princess Frog- is a frog keeping an arrow in mouth and with a crown on the head.\nSimilar myths also exist in Chinese and South-American cultures.The image of a princess frog goes back to an archetype of totem spouses whom the primitive hunter should \"marry\" that hunting has gone right. Wedding on this totem was symbolical, in special ritual. The myth which explained sense of ritual, told about a marriage on totem spouse so that the cultural hero had an opportunity to receive for people any blessings, good hunt etc...\n**Bufotenin is a chemical constituent in the venom and eggs of several species of toads belonging to the Bufo genus, including Bufo alvarius and Bufo marinus. Extracts of toad venom, containing bufotenin and other bioactive compounds, have been used in some traditional medicines.\nIn addition to bufotenine, Bufo venoms also contain digoxin-like cardiac glycosides, and ingestion of the venom can be fatal. Ingestion of Bufo toad venom and eggs by humans has resulted in several reported cases of poisoning,some of which resulted in death.\nContemporary reports indicate that bufotenine-containing toad venom has been used as a street drug; that is, as an aphrodisiac, ingested orally ,and as a hallucinogen, by smoking or orally ingesting Bufo toad venom or dried Bufo skins. The practice of orally ingesting toad venom has been referred to in popular culture and in the scientific literature as toad licking and has drawn media attention. Albert Most, founder of the Church of the Toad of Light and a proponent of recreational use of Bufo alvarius venom, published a booklet titled Bufo avlarius: The Psychedelic Toad of the Sonoran Desert in 1983 which explained how to extract and smoke the secretions.\"",

            "about": "Bill Laswell music true legend, “man with the golden ears“ – 2013, he has been involved in hundreds of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. Bassist, composer and music producer - enough to say that he was the producer for such legendary albums like Motörhead ‎- “Orgasmatron”, Iggy Pop’s “Instinct”, Public Image Ltd - “Album” or Swans “The Burning World” to name just a few.\nIn 1997, Bill Laswell released his sixth solo album “City of Light” recorded in Banaras, India, and mixed in Greenpoint, NY. For this album, he invites John Balance and Peter Christopherson from COIL, they did 13-minutes epic composition “Kála”; and Japanese ambient genius Tetsu Inoue, who decorated the album with its characteristic sound. Together they created an amazing conceptual album full of deep drones, tabla-rhythms, and ambient collages.\n“City of Light” is about Banaras, a city older than history, tradition, and legends. It is Shiva's land, founded at the dawn of creation. It is India's oldest and most fabled city. The Hindus call it Kashi, the luminous... The City of Light.\nAlbum released by Belgium label Sub Rosa in 1997, it was sold out many years ago. Now digipak reissue with a new artwork and with booklet released by Infinite fog Productions and great album available again.\nreviews:\n\"I only have one gripe with this release. At forty-four minutes it's far too short. Surely we could have been given more. There are four pieces here, all very ambient and atmospheric. Firstly let me say that the tabla work by Trilok Gurtu on Nothing is some of the best I have heard in ages. Very dynamic and powerful playing. While this is happening, the flute weaves its magic around the drone of the tambouras. Great stuff.\nUltimately what Laswell has achieved is a state of mind and this for me is the real strength of this recording. I love this and full marks to Laswell and his gang for putting it out. Even though it is a tad short.\" - Hans Stoeve (Nadabrahma)\n“The opening \"Nothing\" features a lengthy passage of tabla playing by Trilok Gurtu. The instruments slow construction and dissipation of dynamics and myriad of rhythms create a fascinating narrative of its own. The closing to \"Kala\" builds tension through the repetition of spring-like electronic tones that rise out of Carson's erie, unintelligible whispering. Laswell lends his own sparse, dub-influenced bass to \"Above the Earth,\" playing against a buried clatter of metallic drums.” - Nathan Bush (Allmusic)",

It is a collection of tracks from between 1999 and 2010 that has appeared on various compilations or other external projects. Surprisingly, despite the collection fact, these tracks form together a unity like if they were material for a conceptual album and presents a memorandum of a past. Death, decay, melancholia, and sadness is the common attributes and this is also beautifully rendered in the images by Martin Bladh (Irm, Skin Area) used for the artwork. His premature death masks sequence is based on different ageing faces of Peter Andersson and works as the perfect façade for this kind of sound-wise journey and exposure.\nThe Mournful Wounds (2001)\nTaken from 'Perception Multiplied... multiplicity unified', Sweden CD 2001 CMI.\nMoulding and Destruction I (2001)\nMoulding and Destruction II (2001)\nTaken from 'Heilige Feuer II', Russia CD 2002 Indiestate distribution.\nMourn Him Yet (2001)\nTaken from 'A Final Testimony', Spain 2CD 2004...\nreleased March 20, 2013",

            "about": "Kontakt Audio and Infinite Fog Productions proudly present the 25-th anniversary reissue of the one of most unique albums on avantgarde/neoclassic music - Ihor Tsymbrovsky - Come, Angel.\nRecorded in 1995 in Ukraine and released in 1996 just as a small run on cassette on Polish label Koka Records, the album without any promotion little by little became legendary and madly wanted by many fans all around the world. And from the first seconds, you can hear why it is so. Pretty hard to explain what songs play Ihor, moreover that would be senseless. \"Come, Angel\" is one of those albums which are so unique that takes you in a vacuum of verbal forms in an attempt to describe the record. In a few words, this is definitely very intimate and deeply emotional music with an absolutely incredible voice. The first associations could forward you to Antony Hegarty from Antony And The Johnsons, Marc Almond, Arthur Russell, Baby Dee, Bjork. Experienced listener familiar with these great artist knows that all of them are inimitable and Ihor Tsymbrovsky is totally inimitable as well.\nIn 2016 well-known German label Offen Music published 3 tracks from the album \"Come, Angel\" which brought a lot of attention to Ihor's music. This time we're excited to announce the first full album reissue on CD, Double vinyl, and tapes. Beside the full version of the album, you'll find an exclusive bonus song from the cult compilation \"Music The World Does Not See\" - Nefryt Records 2000.\n~\n\"For me, music is a certain way of cultural survival. Here I do not set myself theoretical problems or experiments.\nThe connotations of life are important: rhythms, melodies, their connection with language, poetry, real life, virtual or imaginary space. It is very important to me how the recitation of work sounds, how consonant and vowel sounds dissolve in singing, how they combine musically. I understand sound space as a field of my interpretations, preferences, priorities, and I do not use direct imitation. If I hear a melody or a musical phrase, and it is fixed in my memory, later I extract it in my own interpretation, as already formed by this field. In art, the goal is in the work itself, not outside it. For me, the expression \"To be is to create a new reality\" is another winged reality.\" - Ihor Tsymbrovsky\n~~\n\"Tsymbrovsky - an architect, musician, a poet, an artist; one of the most underestimated musicians in Ukraine's artistic world. Many critics pulled their hair out trying to get to the bottom of Tsymbrovsky's music. It has been inspired by jazz, minimal, modern, ethnic, and meditation music. Tsymbrovsky is not a virtuoso, however, he creates whole worlds with his astonishing falsetto. Although Cymbrovsky's music is simple it is made of many elements. Filled with magic and unusual sensitivity and warmth it can be therapeutic for the listener. This is that kind of music, which can be listened to many times - in a different way each time.\" - Koka Records.\n~~~\n\"Igor Tsymbrovsky's only album \"Come Angel\" (1995) still remains perhaps the most bizarre phenomenon in Ukrainian music since independence. The story of its author is a vivid example of cultural amnesia. In the pre-Internet era, Tsymbrovsky was a prominent figure in the Ukrainian underground, performed on the \"Red Route\", went on tour in Germany. However, he left a minimum of evidence of his activity and became a silent legend for a few. We talked to Igor to find out where he came from and where he was going.\nThe album \"Come Angel\" is eight compositions performed with a falsetto to the accompaniment of a piano. (Tsymbrovsky's falsetto is a legacy of the Lviv Dudaryk choir, where he sang as a child.) It would seem that it could be easier. But, despite such ascetic tools, Tsymbrovsky managed to create a phenomenon unique to Ukrainian culture. Some people compare him to Benjamin Clementine and Anthony Hegarty, but no comparison will be exhaustive. The lyrics of the songs attract special attention: two of them were written by Tsymbrovsky himself, the others demonstrate his remarkable literary knowledge. Here and Guillaume Apollinaire, and Mikhaijl Semenko, and even less obvious poets, such as Mykola Vorobyov or Jozsef Attila.\nThe young performer's first performance took place in 1987 in the club of the Forestry Institute. It is quite symbolic that this room used to be a Jesuit church because such a chamber environment suits his songs about angels much better than the noise of big festivals. However, there were also many festivals in Tsymbrovsky's career: in 1989, Chorna Rada and Chervona Ruta, in 1991, Kharkiv's Nova Scena and Ukrainian Nights in Gdansk, Alternativa in Lviv. Ihor calls his first performances musical performances and notes that they sounded completely different. Unfortunately, we will never know exactly how.\" - Amnesia\n~~~~\n\"The magicians at Dusseldorf’s Offen Music pluck a madly beguiling pearl of late-night songcraft by Ukraine’s Ihor Tsymbrovsky to follow their vital releases by Toresch and Rex Ilusivii. Come Angel was first recorded in Lviv, Ukraine, in 1995, and issued on cassette by Poland’s Koka Records in 1996. There appears to be no prior mention of the release or artist on the internet and quite how it came into of Offen Music possession is not disclosed, and that only ratchets the record’s enigma to astonishing degrees once you’ve heard the music. In a quivering, high register, androgynous trill, Ihor Tsymbrovsky beckons heavenly beings in the remarkable A-side Come, Angel against a swirling backdrop of phasing, subtly delayed organ. It was recorded in one take (this is the 2nd version), and, if we’re not mistaken, you can hear the keys being pressed rhythmically in the background, which seems to be the song’s only tangible connection to this mortal world as Ihor vaults octaves high and close-in-the-mix with the sort of alien, dreamlike vocal that requires pinching oneself to make sure you’re awake. Spellbinding is definitely the word. On the other side he (we’re assured it is a ‘he’ in the promo text) sets two poems by Mykola Vorobyov and Mykhal Semenko, respectively, to emphatic piano keys, this time more shy of FX save for some delay, placing that willowing, avian vocal at a dreamy arms reach in Roses for the Poet, and with a sort of liturgical dark jazz feel, sorta like Lewis repenting his sins as a castrato monk, in the spare atmosphere in By the Sea. This is gold-seal business, we tell ya. Clock the clips and clear some swooning room.\" - Boomkat",

            "about": "The Electric Sewer Age project was originally started anonymously by the late Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson together with Coil affiliate and seasoned remixer Danny Hyde, who continued the project together with John Deek, who passed away in 2013. Contemplating Nothingness is the third release by Electric Sewer Age and the second one that Hyde finished alone. With his work as Electric Sewer Age, he explores the vast open space between the dark psychedelic aesthetics that he has helped establishing together with John Balance and his longtime collaborate Christopherson with a postmodernist approach that is deeply rooted in studio practice and sampling. On Contemplating Nothingness, disembodied voices mingle with subdued rhythms, muffled harmonies, or menacing string themes. Over just a little bit more than half an hour, Hyde conjures up traditional and contemporary production techniques and genres like plunderphonics, Leyland Kirby's V/VM project, or early vaporwave, all while retaining his singular voice. Throbbing industrial gives way to jazz-inflected quasi-rap, autotune balladry, and ethno-ambient, before closing on eerily alienated synth-pop sounds and a stunning exercise in psychedelic minimalism. Contemplating Nothingness is an album as surreal and beautiful as a half-remembered dream, constantly navigating through the liminal zone of the familiar and the great unknown. Beautiful 180-gram vinyl from Hallow Ground.",

            "about": "In March 2020, Siberian Nordic Fold Ritual Band NYTT LAND will open a new chapter with the 6th album “CVLT” to take you on a mystic travel – path of Shamans.\nRitual songs of ancient Siberia and Scandinavia in an atmospheric mix of traditional throat singing, authentic musical instruments, overdriven guitars and electronic music.\nTuomas Rounakari and Jonne Järvelä from Korpiklaani were guest musicians and part of “CVLT”.\n“CVLT” available on limited CD and VINYL with different artworks created by Ungodly Designs and masterings by Anatoly Pakhalenko (Nytt Land).\nNYTT LAND's music, skillfully balancing on the brink of ritual ambient and the traditional folk of Northern Europe, is born in the heart of Siberia. Having started as a folk-rock band in a remote Siberian province, NYTT LAND required less than a year to become one of the most prominent and successful Russian folk projects. Focused on ancient Scandinavia, the band rapidly evolved into an authentic music ensemble, thorough yet at the same time innovative. Their music is mostly based on the sources from Poetic Edda, performed on the original Old Islandic. Both male and female voices are used with regards to reflecting the old vocal techniques.\nThe main core of the magical sound of the NYTT LAND is Natasha Pakhalenko’s unique natural vocals, in which clean folklore techniques of Siberia and Saami and low Tuva throat singing easily alternate.\nNotably outstanding on the Russian scene and largely compared with the legendary Wardruna, NYTT LAND are unique in their devotion to the ritual Northern music and tradition that comes along with great talent. Their almost reenacting approach, genuine native hand-crafted instruments, and colossal enthusiasm help them to grasp the true spirit of ancient Northern music like no one in Eastern Europe has done before.\nWelcome to The magic of the Ancient North.",

            "about": "Dahlia’s Tear is a dark ambient project of Anile.D. ; diverse and innovative musically, based in Sweden. The sound of Dahlia's Tear can be defined as dark ambient with drone raw soundscapes, spatial surreal moods and occasionally industrial, experimental influences combining electric and acoustic sounds.\nDahlia's Tear albums are highly abstract and individually oriented. The sound can touch different strings inside each individuality, rising subjective feelings.; diving down deep into the unknown sides of the subconscious with slow-shifting, multi-layered textural drones of melancholy and solitude.\nThe world of \"Dahlia's Tear\" is filled with an all overshadowing darkness and a wind made of despair is wafting through the gloomy soundscapes Dahlia's Tear sound is painting.\nSomethings are beyond the darkness…\nYou could hear the distant rain falling, the wind was calling your name and the shadows play mind games with your eyes. You watched as lightning strikes the same place twice. Then you stared into the darkness. And he stared back with inflamed, demonic, red eyes. \"Why do you strain to see into me?\" Asked the night. \"Haven't you seen me before? Aah, but you have not. I am what you know and do not acknowledge and what you are afraid to find out…”\nDahlia’s Tear debut shows off the use of field recordings and subtle drone to create a dark but vibrant atmosphere and aural reflection of the journeys through fantasy realms and this more introverted and personal touch.\nThis celestial album offers a unique listening and cosmic experience that integrates sound orchestration with speculative dark ambient music to present a melancholic account of one’s inner world rendered in sound.\nOrginial tracks released by Ravenheart Productions (Raven 32) in 2005\nRestored and Remastered at Nightade (Sweden) by Anile.D. (Dahlia’s Tear)\nComes in 4 Panel Digipack CD with Michal Karcz’s stunning artwork\nInviting the listener to distant woods in pitch black with Dahlia's Tear!",

            "about": "Are you the real owner of your existence?\nThe last light in the universe went out on the coast of a metallic cliff where no one could pass. At that moment, a water droplet fell from the most distant stars to the earth. There was a story in this water drop that no one knew. The shadows of twilight deepened as the story grew into a cold, steady rain. Indolently shades of silver crept onto the mountainside and the water formed a mirror, turning the stars into a crown. Obliviously, your essence is snared by the solitude in the gloom of the night.\nMorphing and shifting drones blend in musical, dreamy, light-hearted elements with harsher and remote industrial field recordings projecting the image of enchanted dark woods and snow-covered mountain peaks.\nOriginal tracks released by Alcor Production (Alc 1) in 2007\nRestored and Remastered at Nightade (Sweden) by Anile.D. (Dahlia’s Tear)\nComes in 4 Panel Digipack CD with Michal Karcz’s stunning artwork.\nJust imagine the idea of making dark ambient darker... With this second release, Dahlia’s Tear engage this concept in a most sinister and provocative fashion while simultaneously branching off in a fairly different direction than the debut.\nFor the music lover who can sit and enjoy the evolving sound of someone else’s nightmares!",

            "about": "Cult 1972 album which featured on the infamous Nurse With Wound List.\nDuring the long, dark hangover of the Summer of Love, the classically-trained Essex prodigy approached CBS Records with demo recordings. A forward-thinking A&R executive must have seen a potential revenue stream in Don Bradshaw-Leather's avant-classical noise. The artist was given an advance to record an album. He used the funds to create a large studio in Sussex with many instruments including an actual church organ. Here, on his own, without the use of any electronic sequencing, he recorded \"Distance Between Us\" using simply multitrack tape, layering each part of the composition. Upon hearing the product of their financial investment - four side-long tracks of blurry organ drones, frantic piano tinkling, and ritualistic percussion - CBS got cold feet.\nThe album was self-released on Bradshaw-Leather's own Distance imprint; a vanity label established for the sole purpose of releasing the album. The sleeve art is full of mysteries, from the misspelling of \"Bradshaw\" (\"Bradsham\"), to the coal-blackened visage of the bohemian madman on the cover (DBL himself?), to the rear photo collage depicting the same madman accosting a nude woman. The music isn't any less mysterious; shapeless symphonies of smeared-out Mellotron, tribal drums, and wordless vocals. Don Bradshaw-Leather passed away in the 90's.\nPresented in an unlabeled matt-laminate gatefold 2LP and solid 2CD Digipak.\nDistributed by IFP.",

It was told enough about the early Metgumbnerbone recordings. We just keep some quotes here.\n\"It’s hard to imagine anything more haunting than the folk horror ritual sounds which Metgumbnerbone conjured forth in the Ruins of Industry.\" - Kristian Olsson, Shock Tilt\n\"Working mainly with percussion, Metgumbnerbone evolves an improvisational continuum that depicts subterranean and old, eerie, murky temples; a feeling of dark, ritualistic mystery permeates. Drum beats, ranging from sparse punches and thumps to dense rhythms and tones writhe and sound amid occasional shouts and excited screams. Bells, bones and wind instruments punctuate and elaborate to build an ethereal air of uncertainty and seductiveness.\" - Aeon",

            "about": "\"Remember the wisdom out of the old days,\nthey know undying things\nand nothing troubles the great streams\nand gleams from the holy orchards,\nwhere there is none\nbut fruit that is of precious stone,\nor apples of the sun and moon.\nthey know undying things,\nfor this I have sailed the seas...\nWE ARE ONE\nENA (one = unity in Greek) is our musical contribution to overcome duality, conflicts and separation trying to go towards a resonant, open-hearted attitude. What we seed in our life, in others’ lives, on the earth is what we receive. We are One, separation causes blindness and destruction. WE ARE ONE, WE ALL ARE CONNECTED. Vibration is the very first act of creation, Music has the duty and the right to work on connection being such a suitable and direct channel to express harmony.\nIf our life is meant to be a spiritual growing and not just a materialistic experience, all the domains where spirituality is expressed can become a source of enlightenment. Here is our naked soul alone in “her” voyage. To us, Music is diffusing a spiritual knowledge that’s not linked to a dominating specific religion but to the harmony of the cosmic forces. The aim is to reach again the primeval plenitude, calmness and inner light, being a part of the whole.\nThe magic word resounds before being pronounced. Knowledge and Experience happen at the same time and all of this is a sacred announcement, a message that doesn’t need rationality to be caught. It is a sort of spiritual call coming from the depths. Memory and singing are linked, they enable a deeper subtle “sight”.\nThe ancient wisdom was based on letting go, forgetting ourselves, our ego and masks in order to feel and live “the moment”.\nA deeply felt thank for all what we have received from Greek philosophy, poetry and mysticism. Without this inspiration we wouldn’t be here to do what we do.\nENA !\nThe limited edition of ENA will include a 2 hours DVD collecting exclusive and rare live shootings taken from 1991 to 2014 all over the world.\"\n~~~~~~~~\nНовый полноформатный альбом Ataraxia, на наш взгляд одна из самых ярких записей итальянского коллектива, успевшего за прошедшие 25 лет своего существования записать 18 полноформатных альбомов. “Ena” не будет стоять в стороне творческого наследия группы, он несомненно полюбится поклонникам с первых звуков. Если вспоминать прошлые альбомы, то “ENA” вероятно может напомнить микс “Suenos”, “Simphonia Sine Nomine” и “Lost Atlantis”, только с большим уклоном в сторону ethereal музыки. Волшебный голос Франчески, нежный и журчащий как никогда прежде, и потрясающие мелодии Ataraxia, это даже больше чем нужно, чтобы проводить последние лучи летнего солнца.\nЛимитированное в 380 копий издание в формате A5 Digibook, содержит эксклюзивный DVD с редкими видео охватывающими всю историю группы.\n“ENA(один = единство по-гречески), новый альбом, который является нашим музыкальным вкладом в преодоление конфликта двойственности и разделения. То, что мы сеем на земле, в нашей жизни, в жизни других, то мы и получаем. Мы едины, мы все связаны, разделение приводит к слепоте и разрушению, обратный путь ведет к резонансным состояниям чистосердечных отношений. Вибрация рассматривается нами как самый первый акт творения, а музыка имеет долг и право работать как прямой канал, выражающий вечную гармонию, чистое сияние осознания.\nНаша жизнь предназначена быть духовным ростом, а не только материалистическим опытом. Все области нашей жизни могут быть источником просвещения. Вот она, наша голая душа, одна в \"своем\" путешествии. Для нас, музыка являет духовное знание, не связанное с доминирующей религии. Целью индивидуальтости будучи частью целого, является достижение первобытной полноты, спокойствия и внутреннего света.\nДревняя мудрость была основана на отпускание, забытье себя, стирании своего эго, своей маски, всё это для того, чтобы жить \"в бесконечном моменте\".\nМы чувствуем глубокую благодарность за все то, что мы получили от греческой философии, поэзии и мистики. Без этого вдохновения мы бы не смогли делать то, что мы делаем.” - Ataraxia",

            "about": "After almost two years of work, we're glad to invite you to a new journey through the fog of time and enjoy the upcoming reissue of the great Ambient/Folk record from 1984. A well-known to collectors but extremely rare record by Jon Iverson a multi-instrumentalist from Palo Alto and his college friend, mandolinist Tom Walters. They shared a love for singer/songwriter fare and gigged around campus playing covers of Neil Young, CSN, and Loggins/Messina in the late '70s.\n\"First Collection\" was recorded during the Spring of 1984 in a small garage that had been converted to a one-room apartment in the seaside community of Los Osos, California.\nWith an instrumentation of 12-string guitar, piano, mandolin, analog synthesizers, and sampler, the duo has recorded nine bright, weightless, and diverse compositions where electronic experiments mix with ethnic rhythms, sweeping through inspired folk reminiscent of the work of William Ackerman, John Fahey, Master Wilburn Burchette, and Robbie Basho, to homemade pastoral space folk exuding sophisticated, pale, lunar sonic moods that somehow might remind of the work of Roedelius from the early 80s.\nEquipment used for tracking included a rented 1/2\" 8-track Otari MX5050 analog tape machine and assorted mics. With only a few thousand albums pressed, First Collection has become a collectable in some circles.\nNow, almost forty years later, First Collection has been remixed and remastered from the original 1/2\" tapes for this release.\n~~~\nPress:\n\"Using such non-EM instruments as mandolin and 12-string guitar, Jon Iverson and Thomas Walters produce a distinctly folk-oriented electronic music, full of exquisite acoustic sonorities along with their lovely digital synthesis. Wonderful job of recording, too.\"\n(Robert Carlberg, Polyphony, 1983)",

            "about": "The final blast! After 42 years, the legendary \"For The Raven\" tape by Metgumbnerbone is finally being released!\nAs is known, the album was intended for release on Nekrophile Records back in 1984, but for various reasons the release was cancelled, and Nekrophile ceased its activity shortly after. A bootleg cassette circulated for some time on the underground market, but even that has become incredibly rare.\nAlmost half a century later (hard to believe, isn’t it!?), the cassette version is finally available, completing the collection of Metgumbnerbone's audio rituals on tape.\nTime is nothing - \"For The Raven\" is an eternal monument to post-industrial / drone / improv music!\nOnce you've discovered Metgumbnerbone… there's no going back.\n\"Autumn veins enwrap the bones\nbitter frosts crack lips, crack stones\nthe black winds moan, the branches groan\nwail for the goat as the nails drive home\nwail for the flayed Metgumbnerbone.\"\n-----\nReviews:\n''For The Raven' was the follow-up to the excellent 'Ligeliahorn' LP and was to be released on Nekrophile Rekords, but sadly never came about. 'For The Raven' is highly listenable and in some ways comparable to (fellow Tynesiders) Soviet France's 'Garista' and 'Mohonomische.' There is a lot of rhythm, drums and metal percussion mixing with flutes, gourds, and (probably) trumpets. Large industrial warehouse sounds of scraping and obsolete machinery mixed with wailing and screaming and at times what sounds like glossolalia (speaking in tongues.) This would have been a perfect Nekrophile release and fits in well alongside Zero Kama, Korpses Katatonik, and LAShTAL.' MuhMur\n''For The Raven' is probably my favourite Metgumbnerbone album, due to the fact that it does not parade the Ethnic / Industrial jumble in such a conspicuous and in-your-face-unruly way. In the context of Industrial music, this album is arguably the most traditional and definitely most restrained of the bunch, with its Ethnic elements gingerly blended and/or tucked-in. After 'Dreun,' I needed something just a tad more coherent and structured. Still, I'm glad that Metgumbnerbone had both sides of that aesthetic spectrum covered.' Kazmanovich",

            "about": "released by Eternal Pride Production. Distributed by IFP.\nAghast was a project by Nebelhexe and Nacht, released in 1994. This album was released back then by the legendary Cold Meat Industry and is now presented in a great re-edition Vinyl by Eternal Pride. \"Hexerei Im Zwielicht Der Finsternis\" is the real dark and gloomy ambiance played in a classical dark wave vein. Minimalism in musical content, compensated by spooky and ice-cold vocals that will haunt you. Macabre enchantresses will seduce you and take you to their ghastly realm. Hear gods cry and angels fall. Listen to horror and beauty. Let Aghast bewitch you! Definitely one of the best Dark Ambient albums of all time.",

            "about": "Infinite Fog Presents the Reissue Series of the Legendary Cult - In Slaughter Natives !\nOur last collaboration with In Slaughter Natives took place in 2016 when we released \"Mort Aux Vaches\" on vinyl. Since then, we've been constantly receiving inquiries about new releases from the project, and now we can finally announce: the debut album ISN is returning. All these years it has remained the most requested reissue among our audience - and now it's happening.\nRelease Formats:\nGatefold LP (black; red; grey colors)\n6-panel Deluxe Digipak CD\nStrictly limited cassette version\nExclusive \"Death Just only Death...\" t-shirts\nEverything fans have been dreaming about for all these years.\n~\nDuring nearly four decades of existence, six full-length albums and countless unforgettable live performances worldwide, In Slaughter Natives has become a source of inspiration for countless musicians. The project transcends the boundaries of industrial and ambient scenes, resonating with fans of extreme metal - clear proof that true darkness knows no genre limitations.\nThe self-titled debut album, which redefined genres, was originally released in 1991 in a minuscule pressing of just 450 copies on the then-young Cold Meat Industry label and sold out instantly. This release became one of the first in CMI's history, establishing its unique sound alongside such projects as Brighter Death Now, Raison d'Être, MZ.412, Ordo Equilibrio, Aghast and Deutsch Nepal.\n....Cathedral gothic, Nordic madrigals, Tibetan ritual oratories and the darkest dark-industrial orchestrations - seemingly incompatible elements fused into a unique sound that evokes comparisons with: Richard Wagner and Carl Orff; Early Swans and Laibach; Dead Can Dance and SPK; Skinny Puppy and Delerium; even Deathspell Omega and Elend.\nToday, this cornerstone of industrial music receives its first-ever vinyl release, remastered personally by Jouni Havukainen using the original master tapes.\n~~~\nREVIEWS:\n\"Likewise in hindsight it can be acknowledged that In Slaughter Natives were a precursor the ‘martial industrial’ genre, although their trademark orchestral industrial doom has stood out from and has not been replicated by the majority of projects of a ‘martial industrial’ style (which are predominantly influenced by early to mid-20th century history and era). Thus In Slaughter Natives stand apart with their distinctive and recognisable neo-classical compositions, which articulate a hellish atmosphere of religious laments and amounts to a sonic representation of purgatorial damnation. Their music is a mix of heavy electronics, martial percussions, religious chants, orchestral samples and gruesome demonic vocals.\" - CMI\n\"Many are the tales which could be told about Sweden's In Slaughter Natives. Far-reaching would be their influence and impact. When one thinks of this band, a host of images and emotions immediately present themselves. The sounds of fire and brimstone would be one facet to the work of this legendary band. A quieter, introspective ponderance is another. But perhaps the most enduring feel that this band has to me is one of psychosis coupled with a darkness that has never been equalled.\" - releasemagazine\n\"Apocalyptic, tenebrous ritual music for the most austere practices and anti-social actions. There's nothing friendly here; just guts, glory, guns and violence. One of the heavier recensions of Industrial music, ISN's first creation is somewhat of a classic. ... Ceremonious bad dream. Some people's hells are another's heavens. The gates are open...\" - No Endorphins\n\"The atmospheres on this album are fucking gold. Numerous bands tried that but only some reach this level. (maybe a bit like puppy, or spk, in a sense, but much more atmospheric). - Earx",

            "about": "Infinite fog Production presents Neutral's (last?)come back. Just a year after the grandiose \"The World of Disbelief\", Ash has finished the recording of \"Last Tale of Love\", the album that most probably will stay the last album of the project. After 1,5 years of delays and waiting we are honored to present this beautiful record in physical form.\n\"Last Tale of Love\" it's the same inimitable Neutral as always - dark and beautiful songs with unforgettable melodies, bitter-sweet poetry, and heady soft deep voice. This time a beautiful decoration on the album is the voice of guest artist Alena Ka Boo.\nNotable that the last album includes 2 early songs of the project \"...To The Endless Play\" and \"Last Tale Of Love\". Songs that are well-known by fans through live shows and CDs live recordings in Königsberg but first time as studio versions.\nLimited edition black vinyl with printed inner sleeve - 250 copies.\nMastered by Johnny (Kratong, Romowe Rikoito).\n~~~\nreview:\nThe album “The World of Disbelief”, released a year earlier, had very illusory chances of hearing the phrase “new\" Neutral in relation to another record in any foreseeable future. Neutral is not a stamping project, and Ash lately, has gone headlong into the creation of epic black metal in the Sickle of Dust project, which has found a well-deserved response, sowing reasonable dangers for the future prospects of Neutral. The spirit of the final composition of the previous album, \"When the story is over,\" was also alarming for fans, allowing for farewell interpretations. But still, a miracle happened.\nThe very first chords of the delightful \"Between Tomorrow and Today\" immerse the listener in the unique ethers of melancholy, romanticism, and retrospective triumph, flashes of memories of past triumphs amid the inevitability of existential defeats. Not closed on self-repetition, the melody of Neutral is flawlessly recognizable among any other neofolk, and if we provide that Ash for some reason decided to remain incognito, making an instrumental album, or his parts as an outside vocalist, there would still be no doubt about the authorship of the album. But, of course, enchantment, the signature vocals, which are more and more ripening with velvety nobility, are the component without which the Neutral would not be itself.\nThe autumn of being, a detached contemplation of the fervor of young passions, alien or irrevocably gone, the aesthetics of the inevitable end - and at the same time, recognition of the triumph of the bold path of a fallen angel in spite of inactive heavens. The interweaving of these motifs forms the basis of the traditionally rich, exquisitely complex lyrics of the compositions, contrary to the general mood, which does not pass despondency, only once approaching their boundaries (\"Stone Like Water\"). In addition to drawing on Lovecraft's poetic heritage (Festival), the album is adorned with two songs by Alena Ka Boo in new arrangements, whose soulful voice not only has a special charm but also balances the vital facet - even in the celebration of the funeral feast (Schöne Leich). Performed together with Ash, the noir and touching at the same time composition \"Dust of the Stars\" is undoubtedly one of the record's most valuable treasures.\nAs well as in the last album, it was not done without rethinking old songs. On «The World of Disbelief» was the successful interpretation of \"Playroom\", just as appropriate here came «…to the Endless Play» much more detailed and deep than in the old version.\nRich and by no means quantitative - the Neutral's legacy, meanwhile, plays a twofold, specifically insidious role in evaluating new work. The transcendental Everest, piercing the cosmic or the upper veils, the album «Serpents in the Dawn» ( Eis Und Licht 2008) remains in the eyes of longtime fans an inevitable golden standard, deliberately casting a shadow on each subsequent release, demanding proof of the justification of its appearance; it is characteristic that the releases remain sincerely long-awaited. And no, “The Last Tale of Love” is again not “better” than the classic album, which is objectively not surprising as not possible.\nWe can say with confidence that even a pass-through release - tortured, noisy, glued together from concert/rehearsal material, etc. - created under the auspices of the project, which is key for the scene, would arouse reflex interest and acquire a status-favorable, purely formal regalia. But this is not the case for \"The Last Tale of Love\". Aged in the corporate style Neutral and original already in its enduring \"directness\", the album captures and transports the listener to the borderline supersensible space where life and death meet, and fragments of worldly tragedies shine with poetic reflections of the thin edges of the world. The journey, in which we have already been, traversed by new picturesque thorns and leaving, through the prism of experience, unexplored, previously uncontrollable experiences.\nThe title track, ecstatic with its energy, inherits the intrigue: is the album conceived to draw a line under the story of Neutral? Discussing the scale of the hypothetical loss is pointless. It would be more correct to note that among other veterans of European scenes, neutral is one of the very few who still manages (and doesn't matter how regularly) to create a romantic neofolk that is not distorted by post-industrial experiments, the quality of which, without conditions, without concessions for good name and past merits, is not inferior to the releases of the golden age and the genre as a whole. \"The Last Fairy Tale of Love\" is a brilliant confirmation of this.\" - Vladislav Yarov",

            "about": "This is supposed to be a 40th anniversary reissue. Well, it's still this but with year of a delay. It was told enough about the early Metgumbnerbone recordings. We just keep some quotes here.\n\"Don't be put off by the unpronounceable name or skulls on the cover, 'Ligeliahorn' is brimming with enthusiasm and experiment. It's a completely acoustic (how untrendy!) mixture of ritualised percussion interspersed with whoops and chants that both complement and jar the listener. If I had to use one frame of reference, I'd say that I was heavily reminded of Tibetan ritual music, although Metgumbnerbone manage to get the feel across without any recourse to ethnic instrument, dragging in warpo strains of Balinese religious music. Investigate!\" - David Tibet\n\"Metgumbnerbone were an obscure post-Industrial / Drone / Improv group who had a few releases in the mid-‘80s with the ‘Ligeliahorn’ LP being the only one to get beyond the short-run productions of cassette culture. The four mainly improvised tracks were recorded in an abandoned factory employing various woodwind and percussive instruments and whatever industrial debris was lying around, creating a sustained rhythmic clatter and acoustic dronescapes which fluctuate into recognisable cyclic patterns and out towards sparse pipe fights. Their junkyard sound was always much colder, more sedate than the apocalyptic pummel of Test Department or Einsturzende Neubauten, despite their similar instrumentation. Metgumbnerbone are an ensemble whose recordings have become fetish objects from the most obtuse regions of Industrial culture.\" - Aquarius\n\"Essentially, 'Ligeliahorn' is an artefact in sound in which there’s much blowing of horns and rattlings and rhythmic / arhythmic banging on metal and other unidentifiable instruments and/or objects. An entirely live, on location ceremonial improvisation / action in which the location itself determined the outcome as much as did the performers and their instruments. What is it that makes someone follow a calling that is difficult, ritualistic and comprehensively occluded from the norm? 'Ligeliahorn' personifies everything about the reasons behind experimental music.\" - David Cotner, Freq\n\"Metgumbnerbone had been recording ritualistic performances at locations such as abandoned railway tunnels and industrial ruins for some time, before core member John Mylotte edited several of them into this album. Filled with metal objects being thrown around and massive reverb, 'Ligeliahorn' is the perfect soundtrack to a creepy scrapyard visit at full-moon gone wrong.\" - Freek Kinkelaar, Record Collector\n\"There was a period some time ago where it seemed that the horror industry ever beat on a single button: underground. And from here a lot of products of fluctuating quality but always immersed in the bowels of the earth. But there was already someone in the early '80s who had created a deep and dry sound, more disturbing than ever, that unlike many 'historical' Industrial records, used free improvisation and 'found' percussions as its most deadly weapons... 'Ligeliahorn’ was a record ahead of its years which soon slipped into the most absolute and secrecy cult, fading into myth. Four untitled tracks, simply based on various types of percussions (bones, walls, floors, metals, woods, chains, etc.) and fragments of samples that completed the picture, giving it a menacing and sinister aura (voices lost in the deep, deformed trumpets and violins.) It's the scraping of the Titans against the bronze bars of their prison in Tartarus, the hunter's breath who heels his prey, the myriad of imaginary sounds that only the most impenetrable darkness of an abandoned factory may suggest. All of this and more in one of the most obscure and rare records of the golden age of Industrial music. Magnificent and essential.\" - Drexciyen Star Chamber",

            "about": "No digital, sorry.\n~\nAcademy Award nominee and Golden Globe winner singer/composer Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance) and film composer Marcello De Francisci have joined forces to bring you their first collaborative album work titled \"Departum\". This album is a collection of pieces, which are filled with lyrical soundscapes, orchestrated with vocal chants, cimbalom, guitars, percussion, modern instruments and orchestra. An effort that took two years in the making moreover a journey inspired by ancient world cultures. (Mesopotamia, Europe & Asia)\nAfter the groundbreaking album \"The Trail Of Genghis Khan\" written in collaboration with an Australian artist Cye Wood, Lisa Gerrard returns to Infinite fog with long-awaited complete, extended edition of the album \"Departum\".\nHighest quality sound, ambient drifts, soft tribal rhythms, touching melodies of Cymbylom and 144-Strings Yang Chin playing by Lisa Gerrard and transcendental vocals. All this gives even more in sum and makes \"Departum\" pure pleasure listening.\nCD released in a digipak with massive 20 pages booklet.\nreviews:\n“Some of Gerrard’s most rhythmically lively and vocally enraptured music since Dead Can Dance’s Spirit Chaser.” - John Diliberto for ((( echoes )))\n“Departum“ see’s Lisa collaborate with Marcello De Francisci after working together of a film (Tears of Gaza) and deciding they felt so at home together they wanted to have a separate project to let themselves go on. This has resulted in a wonderful selection of some of the best music in Gerrard’s catalogue and the most instantly enjoyable album since “Daulity”\nQuite frankly, when I heard The Black Opal, my review started this was the album I’d been waiting from Lisa for years… I was wrong. “Departum“ tops that album for me and is utterly mesmerizing from start to finish. There is something about teaming up Lisa’s voice with world music that is built to explode for finale and this album has worked that out a treat. Marcello has breathed new life into everything and now this is firm favorite to go head to head with \"Ark\" for my album of the year (and thus one of the best of the last 10!)” - July 23, 2010, Higher Plain Music  higherplainmusic.com/2010/07/23/lisa-gerrard-marcello-de-francisci-departum-review/\n“It took two years after that to create, record, produce and mix Departum. It was an effort of much transcendental exploration, with an intention to take the listener into a once ancient time where the forces of nature intertwined with humans on a physical level. The way the tracks are laid out is very much like a guided meditation. “ - Marcello De Francisci\nMarcello De Francisci, well-known an American composer/visual artist with an Italian-Argentinean background based in Los Angeles, California. Marcello De Francisci is a big name in soundtracks industry, in 2006 he won the best soundtrack of the year G.A.N.G. ward for his work on SCEA's \"God of War\" game. His music has been used in major theatrical movie trailers such as \"Avatar\", \"Prince Of Persia\", \"Monsters VS Aliens\", \"Seven Pounds\", Hellboy\" to name a few. Moreover, we can remember his mesmerizing music in the sequel to \"Baraka\" art house documentary \"Samsara\". Since 2009, Marcello and Lisa start work together and recorded several soundtracks for major and art house movies. Besides that, their creativity also found a realization in a common album \"Departum\", which became one of the most top-rated albums in Lisa Gerrard discography. Attentive listener may remember Marcello as co-creator Lisa Gerrard's album \"Twilight Kingdom\".",

            "about": "Like many Birch Book/In Gowan Ring fans, we have been waiting for new releases from B'ee. So today, IFP is happy to announce the imminent release of a live recording, which has been in the works for over 10 years. The concert was recorded thirteen years ago, in August 2011, when ifp and friends invited our beloved B'ee to visit us in Siberia, where we were based at that far time.\n“Live in Siberia” is a 70-minute immersion in the friendly atmosphere of a small chamber hall and enjoyment of those songs that you probably know by heart. The Boat of the Moon; The Wandering Boy; White Angel; The Trip Goes On; The Seer And The Seen; Dandelion Wine… if you remember these songs, we don’t need to explain anything. And if you haven’t heard them yet, we can only envy you.\n“Live in Siberia” is available on black vinyl, a limited colored “birch” version (white vinyl with black splashes), and on CD in digipak made of special rough cardboard.\nIn addition, for such an important release we have prepared T-shirts and a wooden box version, which will be a complete set: both vinyl versions, DigiCD, and a T-shirt. (ATTENTION! The box version will be released much later - late November - early December)\nAnd for those who have read up to this point - the first 50 orders for vinyl or wooden boxes will be sent with an exclusive poster (art photo) in a large 12” format from B’ee's trip to the Altai Mountains in Autumn 2011. Act fast!\nFor the gorgeous design and artwork for the luxurious double vinyl and CD, we thank the artist Anton Bogdanov, known for his incredible work for Maeror Tri, Eden Ahbez, Neutral, Peter Ulrich, and many others.\nThanks to everyone who was part of this project and this story, one of the most important in 20 years of IFP! Thanks to you, to those who will become its final part by receiving this release!",

            "about": "In 1991 Coil released the third of their early classic full-length albums \"Love's Secret Domain\", seemingly casting aside the gloom and funereal beauty of its predecessors in favour of a painstakingly multi-layered hallucinogenic electronic beast, which unlike some of their fellow ex-industrial contemporaries' releases of the time wasn't an attempt at easy accessibility or (the-gods-forbid) danceability, but a vibrating psychedelic masterpiece unrivalled in their discography and still a landmark album.\nTo mark its 30 year anniversary Infinite Fog are beyond proud to present an expanded, fully remastered official re-release of this fan favourite available for the first time ever in its entirety on vinyl with 10 rare and mostly unreleased tracks and alternative versions from the period added as a bonus to a luxurious 3LP/2CD set.\nLove's Secret Domain contains among its many highlights the Lynchian William Blake tribute of its title track and the intoxicating single \"Windowpane\", original versions of the later Coil live staple \"Teenage Lightning\" and the majestically warped classicisms of \"Chaostrophy\". Marc Almond guests on the typhonian \"Titan Arch\" and This Heat's Charles Hayward provides some amazing drum stylings.\nThis album produced by Coil & Danny Hyde is pushing their sound ideas and probably their sanity to their very limits. Beyond the iconic Steven Stapleton cover art here reproduced in unseen definition the doors of perception still open wide for both long-term Coil aficionados and new-comers to this supremely innovative release to explore unknown depths. The long-overdue re-release illustrates how far ahead of the curve Coil were with the sounds on this album, which still sounds as fresh and mind-blowing as it did back in the early 90s.\nthe release date for the vinyl editions May 7.",

            "about": "Phlogiston\t17:35\nDesiderium\t10:03\nMyein\t47:17\nIFP present new chapter in our collectors DIGIBOOK ressues of Maeror Tri heritage. This time vey important album \"Myein\", often called \"main MT album\".\n\"Myein\", a monumental work recorded between 1992 and 1993, was released on americal label ND in 1995. This work presented three long tracks that well exemplify some of the aspects of their art: the gothic droning of \"Phlogiston\", the ambient-electronica of \"Desiderium\", and the cosmic doodling of the 47 minutes long title track.\n--\n\"This is probably Maeror Tri finest moment, and one of the best ambient albums ever recorded. It's like a symphony, divided into movements. All three tracks are brilliant masterpieces, never boring or predictable: \"Phlogiston\" features an impressive introduction, with a long, continuous crescendo, ending with a majestic climax in the form of an static blast, soon followed by a distorted ocean of noise. \"Desiderium\" is a beautiful slab of sentimental ambient music, probably the most melodic and beautiful interlude the band has ever done. The 47-minute(!) title track is quite a journey by itself, with a near-perfect balance of haunting drones, meditative percussion, and beautiful melodies going so deep.\nThis album is the most seminal production made by the german trio. Brilliantly executed and properly balanced, this work is their entrance ticket to the hall of fame. The hall of fame of the greatest ambient masters. You get lost in your mind and in your thoughts while listening to this. The tracks overwash you, just gently and softly as possible. It really takes your mind somewhere else. Maeror Tri may have ceased to exist, and Troum may be trying to continue the legacy, but this release shines and will probably remain their best. Ever.\" - Max16032\nLimited edition 300 copies.",

This time in our Digibook reissue series we glad to announce \"Venenum\" - a peaceful analog drone album recorded between 1989 - 1991 years. A first-time \"Venenum\" was released in 1992 as a tape and reissued on limited 200 copies CD in 1999 by very nice short-living France label ÜNE (r)ecords. New version carefully remastered and packed in a Delux hardcover Digibook with booklet. Beside of CD album, there is also a great surprise for all band-fans - bonus DVD with \"Timeless Transcension\" - an experimental video created and released by the band in the 1992 year on VHS.\nThe outstanding artwork was created especially for the album by a young painter and designer from Sanct-Petersburg Anton Bogdanov, who did a great job for \"Peak Experience\" and \"Mind Reversal\" reissues before.\nIn IFP series of Maeror Tr Delux reissues were published:\n\"Mind Reversal\" - Digibook CD (2011) - sold out\n\"Peak Experience\" - Digibook CD (2013) - sold out\n\"Myein\" - Digibook CD (2016) - in stock",

            "about": "Electric Sewer Age was conceived in 2006, a glowing spark in the imagination of John Deek of Divine Frequency. A brief, cryptic announcement in 2009, followed by a few rough tracks released online, heralded its birth. Announced with nothing more than the tagline 'an Infinity of Sewers thrown open beneath the Threshold House', little was known about this upcoming project other than it likely featured some involvement of former Coil legends Peter 'Sleazy' Christopherson and Danny Hyde, and perhaps, it was rumored, with the posthumous contributions of John Balance. Because Electric Sewer Age was intended to be an anonymous aural experiment meant to free the listeners mind of any preconceptions about who or what created it, little more was ever planned to be publicly revealed about the project, even after the first release. However, following the unexpected and untimely passing in 2010 of Christopherson, the first Electric Sewer Age EP became an epitaph to the loss of this peerless musician, for these were the last tracks he and his decades-long collaborator and friend Danny Hyde ever completed together. The music, originally intended to conclude Coil's 'Moon's Milk' series, was released on CD by Divine Frequency in 2012, and then on vinyl the next year by Danny Hyde. Both editions sold out quickly and have been unavailable until now. Moon's Milk In Final Phase consists of four ambient-electronic instrumentals, reissued by Soleilmoon Recordings that also has been sold out. This is a new reissue by Danny Hyde.",

            "about": "\"In this journey, the origins lie in the dust of centuries, in the forgotten songs of the fields, in the foreboding of what is yet to come.\nA path following archetypes and symbols, guided by the voice of the Mother, whose image resonates across the ages.\nAnd a return to where it all began — to the native land, to its deep silence, to its unseen memory.\nMotinai is not a story about the past. It is the breath of the present, carrying an eternal song.\"\nKreiviskai is one of the brightest and most distinctive representatives of the Russian neofolk scene. The project has always impressed with the quality of its execution, the depth of its vision, and the meticulous crafting of both its musical and conceptual aspects.\nWe are proud to present their third full-length album, Motinai, on Infinite Fog Productions.\nMotinai is the result of nearly five years of creative exploration, composed largely by a single individual with significant contributions from vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Maria Prismakova, as well as other musicians.\nAll details about the participants and the instruments used are provided in the accompanying booklet.\nThis album grew out of a deep reflection on local religious identity and the search for archetypal foundations.\nHaving crossed epochs and transcended territorial boundaries, this path of understanding ultimately leads back to its origin — the native land — in a symbolic return to the Mother.\nMotinai is a cultural and creative historiography of the Great Goddess — a presence that, according to the author's perception, has been rooted in local religious tradition from ancient times.\nThrough the archaeology of myths, echoes of the distant past, and a projection into the future, the album embodies the idea of archaeofuturism — a deep rooting in tradition combined with a striving beyond its limits.\nInitially positioned within Tver Neo-Folk (the name Kreiviskai itself coming from Old Prussian, meaning \"in a Krivish way\"), over time the project has dissolved genre boundaries.\nIn Motinai, elements of dark folk, ritual ambient, ethnic motifs, and neoclassical music are interwoven, creating a unique, timeless, and profound sonic fabric.\n--\nFor fans of: Nest; Wardruna, Heilung, Tenhi, Of The Wand And The Moon, Romowe Rikoito, Current 93.",

            "about": "In June 2013, our friends brought us an album by the man named Valery. More than 30 years ago (after 15 years of wandering), he settled in the distant Altai village - Zamulta and did not leave these places anymore. You cannot get there either by plane or by train, and you can only drive by car in summer and autumn. Valery is engaged in homemaking musical instruments like pipes, harps, flutes; he breeds bees and leads the household, which forms the basis of his life. With his minimal resources, he recorded an album that fell into our hands. The recordings united under the name \" Mountain of fugitives\" turned out to be hypnotic ambient compositions built on drawing lo-fi drones, pipes, harps, nature breathing, field recordings, sounds of the surrounding life and the author's voice, occasionally filling the space with references to ancient Chinese and Japanese poetry like Mèng Hàorán and Matsuo Bashō, as well as quotes from the Norwegian writer Hans Burley, or his own verses.\nValerych discovered \"ambient\" for himself as the most suitable form for self-expression without regard to any standards. The serenity of nature, the simple tranquility of a secluded lifestyle, the purity of a self-contained existence and the tension of daily physical labor, all here in these sounds, in the originality, naturalness, and softness of the sounds, which literally disarm and necessitate to play the record over and over again.\nIt took 5 years to prepare all the material for publication. In the meantime, the album has grown to a dilogy with a total duration of more than 150 minutes. Now its 2CD and eight long nameless tracks instead of four.\nEnjoy by pure rural ambient music.",

            "about": "Peter Andersson from the Cold Meat Industry act raison d’etre now presents his sound work for film and exhibition, spanning through the years 1999 to 2006. Peter has been working on several film and exhibition projects, some of these projects never went to final completion but the music was composed in almost all the cases. Music for Film and Exhibition presents a broad spectrum of the sounds and music capabilities of Peter Andersson and those familiar with any of his\ndifferent music projects including raison d'etre, Necrophorus, Atomine Elektrine, Bocksholm etc… will most probably enjoy this double album (Music duration 151 min.) very much..\nFor now Infinite Fog Productions presents complete edition of 'Music for Film and Exhibition I\" which contains real DVD with Natura Fluxus - film by Peter Andersson and Lars Bosma + some rare bonuses, like another Peter's films - Autumn Leaves; Mandala; Dritfing Wall; Nature Morte e.t. Total play time approx. 83 minutes!\nNatura Fluxus brings us on a poetic, existential and suggestive journey dealing with matters like abandonment, desolation, emptiness, inanimation, remembrance and residual energy through places where we can spot traces of presence of mankind. Discover the aesthetic beauty in old factories and ruins: in the perishable and the metamorphoses that follow. Natura Fluxus is a experimental film where concrete, environmental sounds and original scored music blend with visual stunning sceneries of rarely seen places. The film is in B/W and Color.\nHighly recommended! Masterpiece of ambient music!",

            "about": "Finnish Neofolk / Ambient project NEST by Aslak Tolonen and Timo Saxell, well known far beyond the mentioned genres. Every connoisseur Agalloch, remembers beautiful split Agalloch / Nest from 2004 , which is literally killing its brevity, fans Skepticism likely heard interpretation «The Gallant Crow» from Nest. Aslak Tolonen had to take part in groups Shape Of Despair, Todesbonden, Tevana3, Tuonenpolku, Where Rivers End, and of course Syven, new main project by Aslak Tolonen .\nIn addition to the atmospheric ambient landscapes, like musical reflections of paintings Asloka plot compositions revealed through the fragile beauty of melodies of kantele ( Finnish ancient plucked stringed instrument). In fact, the kantele one of the primary assets of the project, giving it a unique, fabulous sound and atmosphere. Once again, you should get the fact that Aslak extraordinary painter and his admiration for nature he expressed not only through music , but also through pictures. We can say that Nest audiovisual project because almost every track exists illustration and one complements the other.\nExisted for a little over 10 years, recording two full-length albums \"Woodsmoke\" ('03) and the \"Trail of the Unwary\" ('07), Nest has ceased to exist and Aslok now focused on a new project Syven. Nevertheless, music Nest is still relevant, all published records sold out long time ago. It was logical to summarize project anthology of creative activity, which becomes release IF- 40 : NEST - \"Within a decade\".\nThis edition we prepared about 2.5 years, and here you will find not only all the music ever recorded by NEST, including tracks from compilations, demos, covers, full-length albums, as a result of more than 3,1/4 hours, but also all the illustrations painted by Aslok, fit 22-page booklet .\nREVIEWS:\nTrail of the Unwary (CD '07):\n8/10 Evening of Light\n9/10 Heathen Harvest\n8/10  RockLine.it\n9/10 - Lunar Hypnosis\n7/10 -  RockLine.it\n8/10 - Aversionline\n\"As it stands this is the best acoustic metal I've heard for almost a decade. If you like Empyrium or any acoustic ambient at all, I recommend giving it a try.\" -hibernal_dream\nNest may not be the only band in this, but it certainly has outputted one of the best albums of this business. It is highly recommended by me. - Melo's Prog Bazaar\n\"All in all, this is a most worthwhile record for those of you looking for a few much-needed moments of solitude in the chaos and confusion of modern life. Listen to this album with headphones, and even those among you who have no imagination at all will find themselves strolling through the mysterious Finnish woods, living a life we have quite forgotten about. And before I forget: the artwork is marvelous! A. Tolonen himself paints the illustrations of all Nest albums, and they are well worth it. An excellent reason on itself to buy it, instead of download.\" - p.surrealm\nWoodsmoke (CD '03)\n\"Taken as a whole this is one of the most exhilarating and imaginative releases to come my way in a long time. This band is on the right trail to becoming one of the most exciting and original folk bands out there today.\" 9,5/10 Lunar Hypnosis\n\"This, my friends, is an ode to our mystic landscapes in the far northern regions of the world. While Nest does not feature any hard-pounding guitars or percussion (at least, not much), this will attract many if not... all metal music lovers!\nFor fans into Agalloch, Tenhi, Empyrium, or any acoustic/ambient music. Beautiful and dreamy!!\" - 92/100 - Metal Fanatix\n\"And somewhere, deep in the darkness of the forest, the music plays on... \" - 10/10 The Metal Observer\n9/13 - Ad Arma\n7/10 – Imperiumi\n5/5 – DarkCity\n8/10 - Inferno\n8,3/10 -  RockLine.it\n9/10 - Kuolleen Musiikin Yhdistys\n9,5/10 - Pimento\n10/10 - Moonshadow\nFabled Lore (demo '00)\n\"A fabulous release, majestic meditative music with an impressive artwork. Totally inspired by nature and folk tales, \"Fabled Lore\" will bring the Northern coldness in your hearts.\" - Bylec-Tum #8\n\"Everyone who likes atmospheric and dreaming music should discover this great artist.\" - 8/10 - Crypta Nivis\n\"This is certainly not metal, but it is most definitely one of the best folk/ambient recordings I've ever heard. I can't wait to hear more! Fans of later Summoning would also dig this.\" - Eternal Frost Extreme Music Webzine\n\"I must say that this record/demo surprised my hardened critic's senses, such pure emotions and strong sense of athmosphere. I predict a great future for Nest, get this demo and you will see. Sub-Fennica approves!\" - 4/5 - Sub-Fennica Issue III\n8/10 - Crypta Nivis\n5/6 - Vae Solis webmagazine\n~\n“Building of the Nest began in summer 1999. The materials used for building were decided early on, and we agreed that atmospheric acoustic and ambient would provide the best natural qualities to sustain us though the challenges of the Finnish wilderness.\nNest's first offering, a demo going by the name of 'Fabled Lore' was released in 2000. The feedback was surprisingly positive so we had no reason not to continue. This also brought us to our next challenge, which was to get our music professionally released, and surprisingly enough that happened when we got a chance to release our next offering 'Hidden Stream' on a split CD with a Norvegian melodic Black Metal band Isafjord in 2001.\nNext in the line of things growing in the Nest was our first full-length album 'Woodsmoke'. This landmark in our history was released in 2003 by Corvus Records with whom we've stayed since. It was also celebrated with a couple of gigs supporting none other than Tenhi. Following this the Nestlings took time to perform elswhere too, and A.T. ended up playing the kantele on Shape of Despair's 'Illusions' Play' album before returning to the Nest to release a split 10\" vinyl with Agalloch in 2004 - an album which was noted for being as visually pleasing as it was aurally.\nAfterwards Nest took it's time to evolve and hone their output. We spent a couple of years composing new material that honestly ended up as the strongest we've done yet. Everything we had done before went under review and we improved everything we could to the best of our abilities. The fruits of this labor can be heard in the 2007 album 'Trail of the Unwary', and also on a special Skepticism tribute album for which we made our own interpretation of 'The Gallant Crow'.” A.

            "about": "Extremely long-awaited release of one of the best Dark Folk groups!\n\"Neutral\" is a pioneers of Russian Dark Folk, band started in 94 by singer and songwriter Ash and later Evgeny Voronovsky (Cisfinitum) joined him. Literally every song project is surprisingly graceful melodies of guitar and violin, touching lyrical imagery and deep vocals.\n\"Neutral\" never recorded albums too often, in fact their record is a rarity. For 20 years of existence band has been recorded only two studio albums \"... Of Shadow And Its Dream\" 04 (Cynfeirdd) and \"Serpents In The Dawn\" 08 (Eis Und Licht) and 2 concert album \"Walpurgis Night At Luisen Kirche Koenigsberg Live\" 00 and \"Luisenkirche, Königsberg\" 06.\n\"Luisenkirche, Königsberg\" was published in 2006 by the German cult Dark Folk label Eis Und Licht, but only on CDr / DVDr and micro-edition of only 35 copies, which in fact was sold out in one hour. After that, the master of records were lost and we spent almost 2 years on something that would find them, luckily it worked!\nNow recording reissued on factory pressed CD. Remastering by Peter Andersson (raison d'etre) ...\nLTD: 400 copies.",

            "about": "\"Neutral\" is known as pioneers of Russian neofolk and one of our all-time favorite bands. Neutral started in 1994 by singer and songwriter Ash, having dramatically changed their musical direction from industrial to acoustic neofolk sound in 1998. SInce then almost every song of the band is a graceful combination of guitar and violin melodies, touching lyrical imagery and deep vocals.\nNow Neutral is back! We are really glad to announce Neutral's new, long awaited album. For seven years, after releasing the widely acclaimed album \"Serpents In The Dawn\" in 2008, Ash has been concentrating on his vision on what is to become \"Дни самозабвения\" (The Days of Self-abandonment). All the lyrics on the album is performed in Russian and we are sure this will add a new dimension to the long musical path of the band. The sound of the native language offers an exclusively intense experience which cannot be described or translated, only perceived.\nFor years we have been waiting for a new Neutral album and now ready to welcome one of the most important neofolk release of this year.\nNeutral are back with a new masterpiece of melancholic and nostalgic music comprising all the necessary elements for the perfect acoustic journey - warm guitars, emotional strings and deep vocals.",

            "about": "Limited to 250 copies! LP+booklet.\nNews for Dark Folk peoples. Is darkfolk dead or alive?\nNo doubt nowadays this is not so \"popular\" as when C93 released their \"Earth Covers Earth\". The seeming primitiveness of the style gave rise to thousands of groups repeating the same thing and the style left the radar of interest. But what about legendary masterpieces by Sonne Hagal, Sol Invictus, Forseti, Current 93, Ordo Equilibrio, Nature and Organisation, : Of The Wand & The Moon:, Backworld, Nebelung, Vali, Neutral of course, and more other bands who create simple, but fragile and beautiful pieces of music? Like all beautiful, this is still actual and interesting and many of the albums of those bands passed well the test of time. Those who don't familiar with Neutral's music could be shocked by his extremely emotional, but quiet and soft style of song-writing. Touching lyrics and melodies are all that is here, but this is more than enough. It is appropriate to say that the best songs should be given the simplest arrangements in which they can shine. It's a brave move that allows the exquisite quality of songwriting to be appreciated fully unobscured by layers of instrumentation.\nNeutral is not a newcomer on the stage, the band is active since 1994 and is well-known, especially for their highlight album \"Serpents In The Dawn\" which became a true classic of Dark Folk and Neo-Folk music.\nNever being hunting for popularity, Neutral always works slow, during 25 years of existence they've released one concert album and only 4 full lights, including the last one \"The World of Disbelief\" 2019. But each of the released records is a pure gem for those who love song-based art.\nLike Rome, ORE, Lux Interna, KTAOBC, and a lot of other talented authors, Neutral is overgrown and surpassed Dark Folk and Neo-Folk, showing that they create unique music which does not belong to #tags but belongs to the realm of feelings and beauty.\nDigital version:  neutralfolk.bandcamp.com/album/the-world-of-disbelief",

            "about": "So, finally, published 16 years ago on the US label L.S.D. The organization, the work of the fathers Mz.412 cult and many other great projects are again available, this time on CD. Yes, if you remember in 2001 it was a limited vinyl edition only.\n\"Northern Dark Supremacy\" was the first collaboration between Henrik Bjorkk and Jonas Aneheim in the framework of Nordvargr / Drakh, only 5 albums were released by this band, the last one in 2008. Thus, this reissue is the first activity of the duo for almost ten years, we can speak about conditional activity since the re-release contains also exclusive material.\nSince 20012, the Infinite fog Prod. Is conducting a project to publish this clot of darkness and the gloomy Swedish Lord\nNordvargr was looking for master tapes that, in addition to the published tracks, should still contain some material from the same sessions that simply did not fit into the vinyl. In 2016 everything was ready, 3 additional tracks were added and the duration of the album grew to an impressive 55 minutes, becoming a full-fledged, exciting long-play. For the development of design was invited well-known dark music artist Horth (Goatpsalm, Karna, Sick Rites), whose style is the best suited to the visual display of the atmosphere of the album. And now in the autumn of 2017, we are ready to present you the final version of \"Northern Dark Supremacy\", an album recorded on the icy boundary between Black Metal, Dark Ambient, and Black Industrial. Mix \"A Blaze In The Northern Sky\", Lustmord's - \"Heresy\" and. let's say \"Information Overload Unit\" and you get an approximate idea and what awaits you.\n\"Massive and ugly-gloomy landscapes of the true atmosphere of black metal from the founders of the already legendary Swedish industrial scene. The ghouls, groans, and voices of the united forces of death trapped in the underground cells of Bohult. Attention - this can be dangerous for your health! No jokes, no hopes ... \"",

            "about": "Northaunt started in 1996, by Herleif Langas & Ketil Soraker to create atmospheric, melancholic ambient mixing environmental recordings and minimalistic melodic elements (usually piano or guitar), treated nature sounds, samples and bits of melodies.\n\"Barren Land\" is the second full-length release from Northaunt, after \"The Ominous Silence\" 2001. Recorded 2002-2003 during a one year stay in Spitzbergen, an island in the arctic region north of Norway. A desolate place that together with field recordings from various places (Norway/Spitzbergen/Greenland) has inspired the most arctic album by Northaunt.\nBarren Land is a masterpiece of nature's inspired ambience, release that returns the listener to the icy floes of Norway, not only figuratively presented but also literally sampled woven into a poignant ambient work that is a worthy heir. Seeking to underpin humankind‚s intrinsic relationship with nature, the music delves far more than simple reverb and endless drone; melodic guitar performs contrapuntal to glacial drifts groaning as giants, evanescent lisps of male and female voice grace the skies like aurora, plaintive piano swirls in the eddies of gelid and industrial storms.\nThe sound is sumptuous, the sampled atmosphere is crystal-clear, fermenting an ever-evolving stereo experience buoyed through the minutiae within each sculpted locations. Overall, the album‚s tone, while melancholy, is not oppressively dark, nor is it too gloom-shrouded for that matter, leaving the mood pleasantly doleful. An organic mutability infuses the album, each track stands apart from another, and within itself gelid textures explore and evoke the Antarctic Ocean currents and lonely land it surrounds. Lovers of high quality and individualistic ambient music will not go unrewarded should you pick up this gem among the snowfields.\nFirst time \"Barren Land\" was released in 2004 on currently defunct, but well know Polish label Fluttering dragon records. Almost 10 years pass away and this frequently sought album is just impossible to find in shops.\nNow, we are excited to introduce new, expanded edition of this beautiful recording. In addition to the \"Barren Land\", you will find extra CD incl. mini-album \"In The Midst Of Life, We Are In Death\" also from 2004, unreleased track \"Winter II\" from 2004 as well and absolutly NEW(!) composition \"Hopeless Dreams\" which is the 1th track recorded by both member of Northaunt since 2006!\nChanges were also artwork and packaging, now 2CD placed in finest Digibook with 12 pages booklet with additional information and fotos from 2002-2003 made by Haerleif. New front cover based on Herleif's foto too, and reminds us about early 90's with their wonderful b/w stile and about majesty of the BARREN LAND...",

            "about": "ORCHIS is an English Dark Folk band consisting of Tracy Jeffery (who also sings with Cunnan and J Greco's SQE), Amanda Prouten and Alan Trench (Cunnan, SQE, Twelve Thousand Days(with Martyn Bates), Temple Music). We have so far managed to release four albums to date starting in 1994 with The Dancing Sun (cryptanthus /World Serpent), which was more a collection of formative pieces than anything else, then in 1997 the concept album that was A Thousand Winters (cryptanthus / World Serpent). Mandragora (Trisol), an alchemical album based around the themes of life, death and the transmutation of the soul followed in 1999 and in 2001 Trait (a ‘best of’ released through the Russian Brudenia label). Relocation and various tedious problems put ORCHIS on the back burner for a while whilst we buried ourselves in other projects like the busy bunnies we are; we raised our heads out of the mire again in 2007 with the ‘Other Days’ download ep via the (now sadly defunct) Woven Wheat Whispers legal folk download service... There have been numerous compilation album appearances over the years, with some tracks turning up on the ‘Trait’ album. We like to think, as the Fairports had it, that we are Nicely Out Of Tune - there was the odd perfect take, but those were never the ones that went on the albums - rather it was the ones that kept to the True Spirit....\nFor now, we are happy, to inform you about the important, re-release of the second long-play, from this Esoteric Dark Folk band!.\nA TOUSAND WINTERS it is improbable result of the deep mystical experiences embodied in studio work! It's a сonceptual album, with Grand Theme: The story of one part of Europe is extraordinarily like every other part; a thriving pagan culture that at first laughs in derision at the priests of the desert messiah, and then is slowly submerged by the rising tide of christianity until all that remains is folk memory and old tales and songs. The cult of the Nazarene has built many truly awe-inspiring cathedrals from the blood of the people of Europe whilst incorporating and subverting their culture into that of the Blood of the Lamb.\nWe can to tell that on music, it is mystical dark folk with an impurity of a classical English psychedelia of the end 60th or \"Psychic TV\" pouring \"Allegory and Self\" / \"Trip Reset\", probably to draw parallels with early works In Gowan Ring, but these words and comparisons it will be final a little what to describe music of great group! This inexpressible travel one way...\nNow this album also the important part of history Neo-Folk of music to which we again have possibility to touch...\nSo, ORCHIS again with us and returning begins with \"A THOUSAND WINTERS\" which we with pride represent in 6 pannel-digiCD with a bronze stamping.",

            "about": "Seven new, previously unreleased subterranean events from the notorious Newcastle-Upon-Tyne ritual / industrial act featuring members of The New Blockaders, Masstishaddhu, Sir Ashleigh Grove, and Sedayne.\nEnacted by an uncertain light the celebrants descent past bone white nitre and through malodorous exhalations of damp and decay invading the sepulchral silence with a ponderous and doleful clamber and setting the tenebrous shadows to dance.\nMetgumbnerbone is an organic and rotating outfit including John Mylotte, Richard Rupenus, Philip Rupenus, Sean Breadin, and Mike Watson.\n\"The band debuted with the 1983 album 'Ligeliahorn' featuring percussion and ambience, the album was purported to be recorded using flutes and percussion objects made from human bones excavated illegally from a graveyard. A story which has been a firm part of Metgumbnerbone's mythology since...\n'Out Of The Ground' brings us seven previously unreleased recordings, divided into two suites: 'Tunnel' and 'Culvert', referring to their recording circumstances. What we get is typical Metgumbnerbone: ritualistic, shamanic percussion performances where the recording space's ambience plays a crucial part. Some of it is of a chaotic nature; some pieces are more structured. The mid-tempo percussion and the spectrum of instruments used, various percussion devices, metal screeching, flutes (human thigh boned or perhaps a Pungi?) and the occasional chant give this album a coherent feel... The final track holds the surprise: here, the sparse flutes dominates over the relentless percussion, the ambience of the space it was recorded coming to the fore, resulting in a beautiful but outer-worldly piece of music... a fascinating addition to Metgumberbone’s canon\" (Vital Weekly).",

            "about": "We are very excited to bring you a new IFP release – the first vinyl\nedition of Peter Ulrich's debut solo album “Pathways And Dawns”.\nWidely known for his past work as drummer/percussionist with legendary Dead Can Dance and contributor to 4AD's This Mortal Coil, Ulrich emerges here as a writer of hauntingly beautiful melodies\nand deeply poetic lyrics. “Pathways And Dawns” is packed with driving\nrhythms and meditative ritual patterns of percussion. With some\ninspired guitar-work, arrangement, and production from DCD mastermind Brendan Perry, the result is a pure delight...\nThe album was recorded in two parts, the first in England in 1990,\nand the second after a long time break in 1996-97, by Brendan Perry\nat DCD's Quivvy Church studio in Ireland. The album was released on CD in 1999 on the US label Projekt and was dubbed by critics as \"the\nalbum the Beatles might have made had the group signed with 4AD\ninstead of Capitol\" and \"a wonderful collection of songs that, while in the 4AD school, shimmers with an inner lightness that makes it very different \".\nThis absolute masterpiece of spiritual music, so badly wanted on vinyl for so long, is available now. Mastered from Original master takes by Martin Bowes (Attrition).\nReviews:\n\"His first album is a remarkable piece moving on the edge between ethnic and medieval art pop music\" - SideLine\n\"Ulrich's gifts as composer, percussionist and vocalist win over the listener... The excellent \"Nocturne\" is Beatlesque, with Spanish guitar and rich orchestral bridges, and \"The Springs of Hope\" sounds swiped from the same album the Fab Four might have made had they signed with 4AD instead of Capitol. The closing track \"Time and a Word\", recalls late 70s Eno, nicely rounding our a release that leaves one wanting more.\" - Alternative Press\n\"Pathways and Dawns is a wonderful collection of songs that, while in the 4AD School, shimmers with an inner lightness that makes it very different from any other 4AD album.\" - Lexicon\n\"Ulrich makes his own way... from the majestic epic of the ten years old soldier “Taqaharu” to the joyous celebration of the source of inspiration on The Springs of Hope... dreamy lyrics a la Syd Barrett... This is a fine album by an artist I'd love to hear more from soon.\" - Ink Nineteen\n\"It’s beautiful... it's also very interesting in its choice of world-sound crossovers and skillful lyrics... Emotionally poignant, poetic, and in its own way, experimental.\" - New Age Voice\n\"Ulrich successfully incorporates graceful folk music, powerful tribal beats, and soothing synths into one enchanting full-length effort\" - Outburn",

            "about": "On \"Peak Experience\", the masters of guitar-oriented Drone music were still quite noisy and expressive. Industrial collage breaks through the already recognizable transcendental drone to blow you out.\nRecorded in December 1988,\"Peak Experience\" finds its first edition in the 89th on a prominent American label \"Harsh Reality Music\", and in the 90th European version published \"Bestattungsinstitut\". 15 years later, in 2005, two famous Italian labels Blade Records and Afe Records ( label operated by Andrea Marutti), joined forces and re:discovered this album for industrial scene releasing in a limited 200 copies CDr version. Since then, the album sold out long ago , and CDr's oxidized for a limitation period .\nNow it's available again, buy finaly on CD in Limited Digibook version, exactly 25 (!) years from the date of recordings. Worked on the design of a talented artist from St. Petersburg , already familiar to us on registration \"Mind Reversal\", and performed excellent remastered 121 (Closing The Eternity; Velehentor).\nQuarter of a century - big time, especially for industrial music , but Maeror Tri with their \"Peak Experience\" passes this test with confidence. Despite the modest equipments, it seems that this album does survive another one or more quarter of a century , while remaining interesting , inspiring and dissolving ..",

            "about": "After masterpiece \"Gaslights\", Infinite fog proudly presents Aghast Manor’s second album \"Penetrate\"!\nAghast Manor as a whole is a creation of musician, novelist, actress Andrea Nebel and on this album grand Dark-art master Jouni Havukainen (In Slaughter Natives) joined her!\n”Penetrate” invites you to a dark and haunting flair of ambient sounds combined with styles of symphonic industrial, dark cabaret and jazz noir. Sinister and peculiar indeed, but undeniably beautiful and alluring!\n”Penetrate” seduces with an overall concept of 1940’s Paris, fallen suicidal women, wicked asylum nurses and Russian spy.\nAs Andrea explains: ” Penetrate is in a way for me a journey through the typical clandestine stereotypes of different European countries, like the songs ’Fleur De Marie’ and ’Today Is My Day’ with atmospheres of Paris’ shady cabarets and colourful harlots. Or songs like ’Asylum ’45’ and ’Worship Me’ with images of Dominas, German asylums and wicked wardens, or the mighty ’The Venice Murder’ which is supposed to invoke images of Venice gloom, phantoms and poisoners, or the bizarre song ’Spy On The Wall’... I want the music to be there for everybody who likes to enjoy a little strange and haunting experience...it’s best enjoyed alone at night!”",

            "about": "Infinite Fog Productions is thrilled to announce the long-awaited reissue of the legendary Psychonavigation series in a 5CD Box format!\nAfter countless delays in recent times, we are excited to break the silence and kick off a series of announcements! First up is the long-awaited reissue of the outstanding Psychonavigation series, created by the legendary artists Bill Laswell and Pete Namlook.\nFrom 1994 to 2002, the brilliant producers Bill Laswell and Pete Namlook released a series of five works under the title Psychonavigation—a rare gem for fans of heavy ambient collaboration. Masterfully playing with genres and refusing to be confined by any boundaries, they were mutually in awe of each other's talents and delivered numerous significant projects, including the iconic Outland, The Dark Side Of The Moog, and of course, Psychonavigation. This stunning palette of musical styles ranges from Space, Dark, and Drone Ambient to Electro and cosmic Downtempo, through dense layers of Dub to almost industrial, mechanical techno spaces. These five albums are like personal spacecraft traveling at faster-than-light speeds, carrying five keys to eternity and infinity.\nThe reissue anthology comes in a 5CD box set, with each disc housed in its own envelope, featuring a brand-new design and a complete set of audio materials. The package also includes an exclusive poster with an essay about the project, written by Bill Laswell in Winter 2024. Now, 30 years after the release of the first part of Psychonavigation, the anthology is available in a single box!\n~\nMore about Psychonavigation:\nThe Psychonavigation series, originally released between 1993 and 1999, marked a milestone in the world of ambient and electronic music. Each album in this series represents a unique journey into soundscapes, creating deep and immersive atmospheric textures. The creative genius of Bill Laswell combined with the innovative approach of Pete Namlook made this series a remarkable achievement in electronic music.\nBox Set:\nCD I: Psychonavigation I (1994): The beginning of the collaboration between Bill Laswell and Peter Namlook. Melancholic and introspective compositions, the endless solitude of space.\nCD II: Psychonavigation II (1995): The second album continues the exploration of atmospheric sounds and electronic landscapes. This release features more complex textures and more clearly structured compositions while maintaining the characteristic ambient and experimental electronic elements of the series.\nCD III: Psychonavigation III (1997): The third album delves deeper into atmospheric sound and offers even more diverse sonic palettes. The mutual understanding between the musicians became even deeper, and it seems that on this album they found their unique language of communication. Rich and multilayered compositions where Laswell and Namlook continue to explore the boundaries of ambient and electronic music. Bold decisions on \"Reentry\", \"Dark Matter\", and \"Event Horizon\", boundless experimentation, and creative freedom.\nCD IV: Psychonavigation IV (1999): The fourth album continues the theme of deep and introspective soundscapes, but with the addition of new elements and experimental approaches. The sounds become even more complex and mesmerizing, faster-than-light speed, and worlds of other dimensions.\nCD V: Psychonavigation V (2002): The fifth album concludes the series with a focus on a more structured approach to ambient music creation. The endless depth and cosmic melancholy remain but with a more pronounced sense of completion. This is the fifth key to eternity… not a landing, but a final transition to a new universe.\n~~\nReviews:\n“The five-album series, Psychonavigation spans 1994 to 2002. Each album has its own character, but if you listen to the entire series back-to-back the albums can blend into one another almost seamlessly.\nMy first impression, starting with the 38-minute “Psychic and UFO Revelations in the Last Days,” was that it was a trippy, spacey, and bassy ride. Nothing really changed that impression through the rest of the series.\nThe Psychonavigation series is a must-have for Laswell completists (and, presumably, Namlook completists as well…) and might appeal to folks who are really into ambient, electronic, dub music. It’s a journey somewhat in the vein of early Pink Floyd without quite so many dynamics or Syd Barrett’s guitar or Nick Mason’s drums to bring it closer to contemporary rock music. But if you dig early Floyd, you’re primed for Psychonavigation.” - by Joe Brockmeier on  dissociatedpress.net",

            "about": "Long-awaited release from this legendary Swedish Industrial band! After 6 long-play albums, in many respects defining the genre, the time has come for the solid 3CD collection of all band unreleased and rare music. Absolutely everything from early demo-tapes, 7”, splits, live-sessions, archives and besides. This is PUISSANCE in their own unique, inimitable style. We have been waiting for the proper releases of \"Krig\" & \"Obey, Hate, Die\" years, and now they are here with carefully mastering from 121 (Velehentor, Closing The Eternity). Remastered versions of \"War On\", \"Hail The Mushroom Cloud\" and many many more... There are 3,5 hours of listening, ecstatic experience and catharsis.\n3CD placed in hardcover digibook with an information booklet. For the artwork and design, we invited great painter Artem Grigoryev, who did exclusive art especially for PUISSANCE.",

            "about": "Klaus Wiese (1942-2009) was a German musician and sound researcher. Wiese brought the teachings of Sufi Hazrat Inayat Khan to Germany from his travels in the East. His album \"El-Hadra, the Mystik Dance,\" which he created with Mathias Grassow and Ted de Jong, made him famous in the genre. Under his own name, From 1981 until his unexpected death in 2009 he released upwards of 60 recordings, not including collaborations(with Oophoi, Mathias Grassow, Ted De Jong, Jim Cole, Al Gromer Khan... to name a few). Wiese’s music exists at the nexus of several overlapping modes - ritual, dark ambient, environmental - yet new age exerted an influence as well, most audibly on these late 1980s outings.\nOn his recordings, Wiese used Persian stringed instruments, Tibetan singing bowls, bells, voice, and other exotic instruments.\n\"Qumra\" duology was released in 1986 and 1987 by a German label Aquamarin Verlag and reissued on small run cd-r by Gianluigi Gasparetti (Oöphoi) on his own label Umbra. Since then both parts became extremely rare items and top-wanted albums for searchers of spiritual ambient music. \"Qumra II\" was included in the 20 best new age albums ever recorded, by FACT magazine. \"Qumra\" is one of the most beautiful ambient recordings I have ever heard. A sweet stream of otherworldly music dissolves time and space and brings you to a place of perfect and endless tranquility. This is a sound of a moment that is equal to eternity.\nBeing in love with the albums for many years, the idea of reissue always bothered us, and finally, with the help of our friends The Fact Of Being, we're blessed to release it first time on a CD and hope these 2 small beautiful plastic circles, like a right puzzle, will take its place in your heart and collection.\n~\n\"Qumra\" sways like a censer in some ancient holy place, birdsong and pensive strings simmering across a smoke-streaked, slow-motion expanse, as if willing an extra-dimensional visitation to occur. The B-side (‘The Hidden Treasure’) is more literal in its mysticism but no less levitational, a swirling, endless Om braided with majestic, resonant tanpura, epitomizing Wiese’s Sufi pursuit of “the fugitive moment of ecstatic sensation.” - FACT",

            "about": "Staruha Mha(Старуха Мха) of 2001-2004. Controversial, but certainly one of the most interesting, significant and at the same time little-known Russian dark ambient-industrial projects. The only person behind this is Roman Sidorov (6/02/1974 - 20/09/2003), in whose fate creative research, unfortunately, played an unsuccessful and decisive role. Roman, even many years after his king remains one of the most mysterious and respected musicians in all of modern dark ambient/industrial, and his famous project \"Staruha Mha\" does not fit into the framework of any direction - it is a separate, unique part of world music...\n📀 The release was prepared in collaboration with the label \"GSP\" and achieved success thanks to the constant support of friends, associates and like-minded people of Roman Sidorov.\n📀 The full version of the release, consisting of the following:\nCD 1. Lights. Alternative version of 2001.\nCD 2. Lights. Remastered Version of 2004.\nCD 3. Rusali. Original Version of 2002.\nReviews:\n\"Music desperately strives to grasp the meaning of the fundamental principle of things, slowly leading the listener through the labyrinths of the enchanted forest from a child's dream. It does not wag its tail or show off, and does not need aesthetic justification. Here, everything breathes the smells of last year's withered leaves, melting snow, the flow of spring waters, the creaking of trees in the wind, the smoke of forest fires. Roman's nature comes out full of secrets and mysteries. The theme of loneliness cries out in every echo, in every rustling sound. That is why the main mood of \"Fires\" is melancholy, bordering on outright depression. The music does not frighten, it alerts and fixes in a state of thoughtful vigilance. \" - Stereo&Video/Nikolay KIRYUKHIN\n\"The crackling of a fire and the rustling of branches. Falling leaves. Wind and splashing water. Light, almost airy overtones and heavy oppressive hum. Human voices and monotonous rhythm. On this record you can find a wide variety of sounds and moods: from serenity and meditative detachment from reality to a feeling of anxiety and fear of the unknown. \" - Darkside/Tra6head\n\"Roman managed to extract music from everything that surrounded him: the tapping of sticks against each other, the clatter of train wheels, the rustle of the wind in the treetops, the rustling of leaves. He made this world sound special.\" - Darker/Yulia Likhacheva\n\"During the existence of the monoproject, the musician managed to release two albums (Ogni, Rusali), and... committed suicide (September 23, 2003) after several years of seclusion in the Moscow region. To create his recordings, Roman mainly used sounds of natural origin, processed with the help of electronic musical means. The mushroom and LSD motives of \"Staruha Mha\" try to reveal and clearly show (from the inside) all the charms of the strange forest and its inhabitants. The sounds of creaking tree branches, the flow of a stream, the rustle of fallen leaves (sometimes the voice of Leshy and other, possibly fairy-tale, inhabitants), the ominous, calling song of the black pool - death - can be heard in hypnotizing musical compositions.\" - Synthema\n\"Remaining until the very end a unique projection of folklore onto musical mythology, Staruha Mha continues its line of forest mysticism and romanticism of hermitism. The first to see the light was the band's last album, \"Rusali\", leading into even more dense thickets. \"Lights\" sounds a little softer, but, unlike New Age, the atmosphere in these compositions is not at all pacifying and not conducive to a carefree afternoon meditation, but hostile, wild, and at the same time does not violate the harmony. A feeling of loneliness, smoothly turning into self-forgetfulness. Beautiful and very original sound. Sometimes it even seems that this music was not composed in the studio, but actually recorded in the forest - by some kind of supersensitive device that hears the aura.\" - fulldozer",

            "about": "Ritualer, Blot & Botgöring is the CD re-release of Trepaneringsritualen's first tape, originally issued on Harsh Head Rituals in 2008 in a tiny edition of 75 copies. All head-experiments contained herein work on quite simple and primitive levels in the good, old-fashioned industrial way, with less focus on layering and vocals. Suggestive hell-drones and slow grinding dungeon electronics with a concrete edge - toward the inevitable, lifeless end.\nThe edition includes 2 bonus tracks: \"Death Is Your Friend\" & \"Seeing What I Suffer\".",

The deep rumblings and future visions of Atrium Carceri combined with the whispers of historical enlightenment that is Eldar creates a vacuum in time where the future and past coexist. Where nothing and everything is sacred, where the webs of powerful bloodlines are woven and where humanity crumbles.",

            "about": "IFP presents a long-awaited complete version of “Sara Dale's Sensual Massage” OST with 8 exclusive and unheard tracks.\nSara Dale's Sensual Massage was a delightful erotic video with a mystic soundtrack by Coil. Quite unusual for the band dreamy ambient, almost spa-relaxed soft harmonies, bland tribal rhythms, chimes, and birdsong but still with dark mysterious and inimitable Coil musick's charm.\nHowever, the second part of the album explores more rhythmic structures that remind 'Gay Man's Guide...' soundtrack.\nBesides the OST recordings, the edition includes bonus tracks from the \"Basilisk prod.'s\" era: “Theme From Blue”, and grandiose \"The Hills Are Alive\" so badly wanted on vinyl.\nArtwork by Steven Stapleton. Mastering by Martin Bowes.\nThe album available on CD, 2LP in 4 different colors, and Collectors vinyl Box Edition limited to 55 copies.",

            "about": "An endless world stretches along the path of a wanderer. Thousands of\ntrails run not only on solid ground underfoot but also through main\nstreams and rapids of the wayward rivers, striving to carry a\ndaredevil into their depths. Sometimes they take the wanderer down to\nthe underworld or take his soul to the skies with the smoke of a\nritual fire.\nThe border between the worlds is thinning in the fog and the\ntwilight... A shaman is the only one who is able to travel along a\nthousand paths and return back on a narrow path known only to him\nalone. But the time will come, and his soul will stop wandering\nbetween the worlds. Spreading its gray wings, his soul will be carried\naway along the path known only to him alone.\nThe upcoming Liholesie album Shamanic Twilight will tell you about it.\nFolk instruments and ethnic percussion will bring you back for\nthousands of years and plunge you into the atmosphere of shamanic\nrituals and visions. Twilight is upon... the fire is burning out, the\nshamanic drum is beating... There are thousands of paths in the smoky\nhaze.\n~~\nLiholesie is a sophisticated Russian ethnic-ambient act, whose first\ndemo was released back in 2002. From 2004 to 2008, Liholesie released\nfour albums and a split with several metal bands. The project's music\nunderwent changes from epic folk ambience to a more ritual atmosphere,\nso Liholesie became one of the most famous Russian ambient projects,\nwhose audience included the fans of different styles, from black metal\nto neofolk. Then there was a period of silence, which ended only in\n2016 with The Fog of Transition full-length album. It was the music of\nuntouched nature, lucid dreams, and shamanic trips inspired by a\njourney to the Altai Mountains. In 2018 Liholesie released the EP\nFables. It varies from the previous works in more cinematographic\nsound and mood, continuing to explore new horizons of ethnic and\nritual music. And now it is high time for a new chapter in the\nproject's history with the new album Shamanic Twilight. That's the\nmusic of dark woods, forgotten tribal rituals, and spiritual quests,\nsomewhere in between Nordic folk, darkwave, and ritual ambient.",

            "about": "Seventh reissue of this classic album, but first time on vinyl!\nInfinite Fog starts vinyl’s reissues for Ataraxia from their “Simphonia Sine Nomine”. Limited to 250 copies. 195 transparent vinyls & 55 transparent with brown splatters(THIS VERSION). Full colored inner sleeve, refreshed artwork.\nATARAXIA is an Italian neoclassical band who combine modern technology with archaic instrumentation. They describe their music as a cross \"between sacred and profane, ethereal and neo-classical , contemporary and early music\". They make researches into the European legends crossing the Greek and Latin myths. Their lyrics are written in many ancient and contemporary languages.\nAn unusual album that may remind some of Dead Can Dance, Elijah's Mantle, or another neoclasical band of early 90`s. “Simphonia Sine Nomine” seems to be halfway between Gothic and Symphonic Rock. Vocalist Francesca Nicoli sings (in Italian and Latin) over synths, keyboards, electric and acoustic guitars, and occasionally drum machine. The music as a dark 'liturgical' gothic feel much of the time, with lots of minor keys and half-chanted singing, although there are a few brighter songs as well. A very enjoyable album and one of Ataraxia's all-time highlights...\nMastered by Peter Andersson (raison d’etre).",

            "about": "A long-awaited reissue of the important album in early Neo-folk history, which sold out more than 20 years ago. This for sure will be interesting for those who deep in the new wave/post-punk/neo-folk music and interested in the history of genres. The album was released by legendary “World Serpent” in 1995 but recorded in far 1984 after Tony Wakeford left Death In June. A splendid mix of post-punk, new wave and slightly folky, sound bears resemblance to early Death In June, Tony Wakeford's future project Sol Invictus and Joy Division. “Songs Of The Wolf” was released as a tape in 1984 and as LP in 1986, both well acclaimed and sold out immediately. A new version includes the complete CD album plus two rare bonus tracks. This is absolutely everything that recorded by that short-time project, ever.\nThis is music by very young people with a hot blood and raw energy. The album like a trip back in old times, makes you feel young again... but not too much and only for a while. Part the money from sales will be donated to charities like “Hunt Saboteurs”, “Southall Black Sisters” and \"Animal defense community\".\nWe tried to publish this album since the 2009 year and happy that that is finally done. Now we can enjoy music (!) again and some collections became more complete.",

            "about": "The first physical release from SRUB - a young band from SIBERIA!\n\"By the secret path\" is a maxi-single that has grown to the size of a 40-minute album.\nOriginally it was conceived as a mini-release to anticipate band’s debut album - \"SRUB\". The disc at hand includes one song form a full-length album plus its exclusive acoustic version, also there are two tracks from previous online released singles, few instrumental version of various song and two new absolutely exclusive tracks.\nLimited to only 200 copies in hardcover digibook - for the very first SRUB fans!\nReviews:\n”Phenomenal. Most important discovery of the year, the best album of the year and best album in any kind of Russian Rock music for last 15 years.” - CTHULHU COLLECTOR\n”Best album if the year…” - Atmospheric Doom Metal\n\"Feels like the band’s absolute detachment from the present day events is what makes it Russia's most actual band of the time.\" - 10/10 - RockCult\n\"Wicked herbs cut at night by the devils using knifes made of foxes jaws, misty swamps, thickets and windbreaks, ferns, barbed wet branches striking your face, the fear of someone unexpectedly touching your shoulder on an empty path through the predawn field and distant sounds of evil laughter. All of this is here.\"- The Gazing Abyss\n\"The album immediately plunges the listener into the maelstrom. This is one of the main SRUB features - a deep sound made with relatively poor equipment. The sound canvas is drawn by buzzing semi-liquid synths, a guitar breaking through them, distinctive bit with hi-hats starring, and of course the voice of Igor Shapranskiy. His singing is so much enchanting that you start to mention the lyrics only by the end of the album. The sound of SRUB is cold and aloof as if it were calling into the swamp, in a quagmire, where the listener will inevitably drown. The feeling of being deep in the wild either near the abandoned hunting lodge or in the moss-covered woods, or at the quiet forest lake is accomplished by using the sample sounds of frogs croaking and wild birds singing.\nAnd this is yet another SRUB unique feature – the atmosphere of Slavonic Occultism and Pagan Mysticism brought by the original lyrics and viscous sound. \" - 9/10 - BritishWave\n\"While we predict an inglorious demise for all the Joy Division imitators, the Russian post-punk becomes more and more compelling. SRUB’s debut full-format album is opened by tons of heavy grooves and reverberation. Authentic devilry penetrates deeply into the lyrics and melodies of SRUB. Something comparable could be heard on “Pornography” of The Cure. The indisputable achievement of “By the secret path” is the omnipresence of an ancient Russian horror. \"- Katkov Hype Music Blog",

            "about": "The forest is full of mysteries. There are a lot of black trails and unseen night creatures. If they bring you to the foggy meadow, know that the guard has saved. Or you'll be buried in a thicket and never return to the house. And there, at the end of the path, there is a laughing silence, placing spider webs. He's waiting for you. Chthonic.\nSurprisingly, SRUBs mix European post-punk with the spirit of a dark forest, rhythmic shamanism with a meditative occultism, the uncertainty of the future with the sincerity of children's fears. SRUB already irretrievably led secret paths into the wild thickets most fans chthonic and unknown. SRUB is one of the leading groups of modern post-punk, the shadows of long-forgotten beliefs come to life in their songs, melodies burst into the very soul, and the live energy of their concerts makes even Death itself dance, which has already been verified many times. Coming \"Sunrise\", and let it be revealed to us.",

            "about": "\"Those that we hear inside, Those that sing the spring forest.\"\nA thick potion, mixed in the spirit of Siberian forests, mossy stones, and marsh lights. Magic alloy from the old European post-punk, and something elusive-distant, as if calling from the depths of Russian antiquity. All this - SRUB, the amazing project of Igor Shapransky and his accomplices, one of the leading groups of modern Russian post-punk.\nWhat do evil flowers sing about?\n- Songs of evil colors - album Ouroboros. The closing composition of the same name brings us back to the beginning: \"We must find the way back.\" The album is an integral and conceptual, how eclectic and dichotomous. Through the whole album, there are several antagonisms: reality and dream, truth and lies, good and evil. The central key to unraveling the image is faith: \"Do you still believe in fairy tales?\" Everyone must find the answer to this question. In mysterious images it is difficult to discern: is it a reality, a dream? And is the fear of the thickets invented by us? Or the cutis anserina on the skin run in real, our reality? Invisible, but noticeable presence. Obviously. A different force awaits our decisions: \"And with an invisible hand the light bears over you\", \"His shadows sing in the fog,\" \"And He will silently set us the cross\". Whose image is caught in the songs? Who is He? Whether to go after him or He is the phenomenon of evil forces. We do not give answers. We do not know the answers. Songs of evil colors - an album of secrets. The choice of the right path does not exclude the acquisition of sacral knowledge. We are all looking. We are all alike, and we are stepping on the trail. We are revealed but come in dreams. Our log house is abandoned, but full of evil colors. Singing these songs.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nТе, что слышим внутри. Те, что поет весенний лес.\nГустое зелье, замешанное на духе сибирских лесов, замшелых камней и болотных огней. Магический сплав из старого европейского постпанка, и чего-то неуловимо-далекого, как будто зовущего из глубины русской древности. Все это - СРУБ, удивительный проект Игоря Шапранского\nи его подельников, одна из ведущих групп современного российского постпанка.\nО чем поют злые цветы?\n- Песни злых цветов - альбом Уроборос. Закрывающая одноименная композиция возвращает нас в начало: \"Мы должны найти дорогу обратно\". Альбом настолько же цельный и концептуальный, насколько эклектичный и дихотомический. Сквозь весь альбом проходит несколько антагонизмов: явь и сон, правда и ложь, добро и зло. Центральным ключом к разгадке образа выступает вера: \"Ты еще веришь в сказки?\" Каждый сам должен найти ответ на этот вопрос. В таинственных\nобразах сложно разглядеть: то явь ли, сон ли? И выдуман ли нами страх чащи? Или мураши на коже бегут в настоящей, нашей с вами реальности? Незримо, но ощутимо присутствие. Очевидно. Иная сила ждет наших решений: \"И незримой рукой свет несет над тобой\", \"Его тени в тумане\nпели\", \"И над дальней дорогой крест нам беззвучно поставит Он\". Чей образ улавливается в песнях? Кто есть Он? Пойти ли нам за ним или Он - суть явление дурных сил. Мы не даем ответов. Мы не знаем ответов. Песни злых цветов - альбом тайн. Выбор же верной тропы не исключает обретение сакрального знания. Все мы в поиске. Все мы похожи точь-в-точь и ступаем след в след. Мы Явлены, но приходим во снах. Сруб наш заброшен, но полон злых цветов. Поющих эти песни.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\"Каждая строка каждой песни повторяется многократно, подобно словам дошедших до нас из языческой древности заговоров и заклинаний, погружая слушателя в магическую реальность, где прямо сквозь асфальт прорастают вековые сосны, между которыми мелькают голодные огоньки глаз потусторонних хищников. Но весь этот туманный морок и белый огонь твоего сознания - суть одно. Нужно лишь не оступиться, не совершить необратимой ошибки, пройти сквозь ночь и чёрную весну. Венок из сухих мёртвых ветвей, покрытых живыми белыми цветами, плывёт по наполненной смертью воде, из-под которой скалятся черепа тех, кому не удалось.\nКто опустил этот венок в воду? Наша страшная невеста (та самая, за левым плечом) ищет нового суженного? Чья-то душа ждёт, что холодная вода принесёт её венок в руки того, кто многократно помянут в этих песнях как “ОН”? Случайно ли сквозь туманную хмарь нет-нет, а проступят очертания креста? Поток образов, обращённых к дремучему русскому бессознательному, бьёт точно в цель, пробуждая к жизни цепочки ассоциаций, позволяя каждому найти в этой музыке своё\" Сайт \"Другой NSK\"",

The box version limited to 36 copies!\nRecall, the first box ”Bog” (the rarest parts) were limited to 25 copies only and sold out within few days; the second part “Shadow” were limited to 37 pieces and completely sold out in a couple of weeks.\nAs far as we know via your mails in our mailbox - \"Fog\" is probably the most anticipated for lovers of SRUB part of trilogy ... On this CD you will find \"The night rang the bell\", \"For Mushrooms\", \"Ailing\", \"Pad’\" and other famous songs from the early days of SRUB.\nThe box version traditionally goes with exclusive live-TAPE, this time Moscow’s show.\nSame time we happy to announce very limited SRUB t-shirts!",

            "about": "Korpses Katatonik was a musical solo project of Zoe DeWitt during the years 1982 and 1983. Unlike DeWitt's later project Zero Kama, the work of Korpses Katatonik remains entirely within the realm of electronic music and shows an uncompromising experimental style comparable to that of other industrial bands like Throbbing Gristle, SPK, or Cabaret Voltaire. Like many other exponents of industrial culture Korpses Katatonik was inspired by dark psychiatry, pathological abnormalism, necrophilia, and other types of paraphilic aberration. These served as a metaphor for the dark side of a dehumanized society that seeks to maintain control by the suppression of anything that could be regarded as dark, sinister, deviant, or unpleasant from the viewpoint of popular mass culture. As a means of escape from this totalitarian pressure - thus a statement by Korpses Katatonik - there remains only self-destruction, murder, or the withdrawal into catatonic schizophrenia.\nKorpses Katatonik's first release was a Nekrophile Rekords cassette entitled subklinikal leukotomy aphrenia spasmophiik lyssophobo asphyxia sinister lethal anorex. The titles on the album were: shatok, schmertzlabor, enzephallik mortuor, nekom, kcok transzlant, kaltfleisch corporor, skarzisko and okzipital slash. The terminology of psychopathological disorders was used by Korpses Katatonik in a subversive way for its own poetic value and many of the rare vocals and track titles (as for example shatok, enzephallik mortuor and kaltfleisch corporor) were taken from writings of patients of Viennas famous psychiatrist hospital in Maria Gugging (dissolved in 2007). The title skarzisko refers to a national socialist concentration camp in the polish town Skarżysko-Kamienna.\nThe upcoming influence of occultism within the postindustrial underground of the 1980s is finally reflected in the last track of Korpses Katatonik, Choronzon, which was published on the Nekrophile cassette compilation The Beast 666. This track, which refers to a ritual performed by Aleister Crowley and Victor Neuburg in the desert Sahara in 1909, anticipates the strong occult implications of Zoe DeWitt's musical follow-up project Zero Kama.\nIn 2012 all recorded tracks by Korpses Katatonik have been released under the title Oeuvres complètes by the Viennese label Klanggalerie. Currently, the remastered album is reissued on IFP on VINYL, CD, TAPE, and ultra-limited collectors box.\nRecorded in 1982 by Michael Zoe Dewitt (synth, guitar, voice, tape loops) and mixed at the Institute for Composition and Electroacoustics at the University for Music and Performing Arts Vienna (Wiener Konzerthaus studios). First published as audio cassette NRC01 on Nekrophile Rekords in 1983. Remastered by Zoe Dewitt for Infinite Fog Records in 2022.\n~~~\n“Millions of dead humanoids walking your streets, remote-controlled Cadaver. The functions of the body, which are considered the highest definition of life, are nothing more than a sign that the totalitarian systems of political control are working as usual. In fact, Death, your own essence of the progress of civilization, came the moment you accepted your terms. Poison injections and 1800-volt circuit, as well as three isolation cell torture chambers are waiting for you if you don't want to. For the glory of Masz Murders and Terror Liaisonz, there can be nothing but bones and skulls. Burnt holes of the psyche and dezpar.\nIn the same way that Corpus Sosial conceives Death, psychic and physical Disorder from the public consciousness, it itself is nothing but the unification of all this. And since the main characteristic of his propaganda bloc is to say the exact opposite of what he really represents, and to use Death, the last argument of all oppression, as an extensive lever, the most effective methods of the operation of expelling the stick will be equally with inverted strategies for choosing the current reality and gathering information to create artificial Malfunctions, as well as to use and fight off Death, multiplying its signs in order to increase the semantic value as an offensive counter-propaganda event. A reverse policy cannot and will not be a policy. Offensive subversion is not so much the destruction of the leading organizations as the actual ignoring of them by organizing one's own body. It's a reversal of your dictated reward/punishment law.\"\n(DEATH MEKANIKS / OFFENSIVE SUBVERSION, Nekrophile Records Dokument 01, 1983 05 23)",

            "about": "\"The Ape of Naples\" is a deeply emotional and uniquely rewarding album. In its immediate accessibility it is somewhat reminiscent of Coil's mid-1980s classic \"Horse Rotorvator\" sharing that album's wild variety of sounds and styles as well as its overriding sombre mood. Originally released in 2005 and in many ways the band's ultimate swan song, it is now considered one of the go-to albums for introducing new listeners to the unparalleled magick of Coil. Compiled and released by Peter Christopherson one year after Jhonn Balance's tragic deadly fall, it includes reworkings of the live favourite \"Amethyst Deceivers\" and \"Love Secret's Domain\"'s \"Teenage Lightning\" as well as several songs originally intended for the ill-fated \"Backwards\" album like the haunting and preminiscent \"Fire of the Mind\" and the superb \"Amber Rain\". Other tracks were created using unfinished song ideas from around \"Backwards\", sampling tiny bits of Balance's live vocals from songs only ever performed in concert once like \"Triple Sun\". Using the lyrics of the theme tune for the 1970s BBC sit com series \"Are you being served?\" for the unbelievably haunting \"Going up\", this album's final track and the last song Coil ever performed live, is maybe the most poignant example of Balance's and Christopherson's method of turning base matter into pure sound gold, and like the title of the album, derived from an imaginary adult video an equally fine example of the often underappreciated humour of the boys.\nChristopherson with the help of long-term sound wizard Danny Hyde and using some of the talent of Coil touring members managed to craft an album which feels and flows like a true Coil classic.\nThe Infinite Fog version is the third Coil record receiving the fully remastered and enhanced 3LP/2CD treatment supervised by Danny Hyde.\nAll of the original material has again been carefully and sympathetically remastered by Grammy-nominated engineer Jessica Thompson who has been previously lauded for her splendid job on its sister release \"The New Backwards\". Coil fans old and new will be thrilled over the inclusion of more than an hour's worth of 9 rare and largely unheard bonus tracks from Danny's vaults completing the set. The astounding design of the original box-set release is restored for the gatefold 3LP sleeve using the fully-licensed artwork by Ian Johnstone (making it easy to differentiate this new vinyl version from previous un-sanctioned LP releases using poor reproductions of the original CD art for the front cover), the CD will be available in two versions with the original and well-loved original CD cover art and for the first time using the former vinyl-only cover art.\nIf you do not yet own a physical copy of the \"Ape of Naples\", or if you always wanted an enhanced version of this masterpiece, there has never been a better time to make that wish come true.",

            "about": "\"IFP's next step in re-publishing albums by drone-ambient heroes Maeror Tri. Obviously it would be redundant to introduce this legendary trio to you yet again. Over the seven years of its existence, they have recorded genre-defining material that has lost none of its relevance even after more than a quarter of a century.\nWe are pleased to announce \"The Beauty of Sadness\" - one of the band's most striking albums. An emotional, melancholy, sentimental, melodic drone ambient album, which can be considered a classic of the genre on a par with \"Myein\". You will search in vain for industrial or noise elements, as featured on the group's more heavy releases, herein the eponymous beauty and sadness reign supreme. This release comes highly recommended for any listener with only a passing interest in Drone-music, be it guitar- and electronic-based\nRecorded between October 91 and September 93, \"The Beauty of Sadness\" became the 11th full-length Maeror Tri tape, which was released in 1996 shortly before their breakup on the very peak of the group's strength. The bonus track \"Immersion in Emotion\" was recorded around the same sessions as the album itself in October 1993, and first appeared on the video collection \"From the Hills of Dream\".\n15 years have passed since the only CD reissue of the album on the Tantric Harmonies label, during which time the album has become a rarity, completely absent from the market, and one of the group's most sought-after albums.\nOur new version of \"The Beauty of Sadness\" has been fully remastered in 2019 by Peter Andersson (raison d'etre) resulting in a literally shockingly improved sound experience, the erroneously added silent tracks from its earlier CD incarnation have been deleted and the overall previously ubiquitous surface noise removed.\nThe design has again been created especially for the album by the artist and designer from St. Petersburg Anton Bogdanov, the winner of the Hermitage competition, who previously worked on the reprints of \"Mind Reversal\", \"Peak Experience\", \"Venenum\".\nIn IFP series of Maeror Tr Delux reissues were published:\n\"Mind Reversal\" - Digibook CD (2011) - sold out\n\"Peak Experience\" - Digibook CD (2013) - last copies in stock\n\"Myein\" - Digibook CD (2016) - in stock\n\"Venenum\" - Digibook CD/DVD - in stock\nreviews:\n---\n\"I’m no connoisseur of Maeror Tri’s work, so I don’t know if The Beauty of Sadness is an outstanding work in their catalog. But I wouldn’t be surprised if it does since it’s certainly an excellent album. The title is fitting, because the music is slow and melancholic, but also beautiful. The minimal, repetitive elements put you in a hypnotic state, the ongoing drones and the well-placed sounds make you drift away. The guitars that were used mainly to create the drones can hardly be recognized though the heavy processing, though at times they come to the surface, like in ‘Pandere’. It’s hard to pick a favorite track...\" -  funprox.com\n\"This is an essential album to all fans of ambient. The music in this album is the equivalent to sitting on your back porch at twilight, watching the breeze gently flow through the trees, partially covering up a red sun in a purple-gray sky. Makes the hair on my neck stand up. I highly recommend it.\" - WFLM",

            "about": "In 2016, Belgian tribal-power industrial sextet Militia entered the studio to re-record their landmark 2000 album \"The Black Flag Hoisted\", the final chapter of the ‘Statement’ triptych. The album was re-recorded almost completely, several tracks were completed, the recording of which was interrupted in 2000, and additional drum sections were added that were not recorded last time.\nIn a few months, the album was re-recorded and for 5 years it was waiting for the release, which was postponed for various reasons.\nThe work presents the Militia's view of anarchist theories - Die Theorielosigkeit des Anarchismus, nihilism, and liberal quests of the late 19th century, expressed in such historical figures as the Russian anarchist theoreticians Bakunin and Kropotkin, the French anarchist Proudhon. The first edition of the album is long out of print, as well as the other two parts of the trilogy, and represent some of the most wanted industrial recordings of the 2000s.\nMilitia's music is always a unique and unique phenomenon. Conceptual industrial symphonies of hundreds of machine voices that travel through time and tell a story. Numerous references to events, ideas, people, and movements are woven into texts, while music, on the contrary, is distinguished by such originality that it is impossible to talk about similarities or homages. The Militia albums, including \"The Black Flag Hoisted\", are not designed to be \"an everyday album.\" This is a rare and, perhaps, too complex work, thought out before every rustle and beat of the drum, deeply revealing the historical and ideological questions posed by the musicians. You will want to return to this recording more than once in order to hear something new and understand what has already been heard.",

            "about": "After epic Psychonavigation BOX we're back with Air! Are You ready for the Travelling Without Moving?\n~~~\nPete Namlook, one of the most influential figures in the history of electronic music, passed away in 2012, leaving behind a vast sonic legacy. Yet Air remains his most poetic, organic, and emotionally resonant project. Created between 1993 and 2006, the Air series is a five-part symphony of ambient, ethnic, jazz, neoclassical, and cosmic electronic elements.\nNow, nearly two decades later, we proudly present the long-awaited reissue of the entire series — for the first time ever as a complete 5CD boxset. From the wind-kissed sensuality of Air I, through the abstract voyages of Air II, the rich instrumental palette of Air III, the stylistic fusion of Air IV, to the deeply personal and introspective Air V — this collection stands as a milestone in ambient music history.\n🌀 Ethereal female vocals, natural field recordings, cosmic jazz, neoclassical textures, immersive ambient\n🌿 Recorded in solitude in Hödeshof, Germany — Namlook’s personal creative retreat\n🎧 For fans of: Brian Eno, Steve Roach, Global Communication, Klaus Schulze\n💿 Limited edition 5CD boxset in a deluxe soft-touch case with spot varnish finish\nA mbient, world, neoclassical, lounge, and organic field sounds — all in synthesis with deep atmosphere and refined melancholy. A true revelation for lovers of expressive electronics and contemplative ambient.\nFor the first time — the complete Air series in one definitive edition.\n“Air is not just music. It is a state of mind. A space. A travelling without moving. A timeless classic.”\n~\nMore about Air:\nCD 1: Air I — You (1993)\nThe beginning of the journey. One of the most delicate and emotionally charged ambient albums.\nEthereal French female vocals, the breath of the wind, slow-evolving synthesizer waves, and a soft touch of melancholy.\nA seamless progression from beatless textures to a techno-tinged, passionate climax.\nCD 2: Air II — Travelling Without Moving (1994)\nImmersion in weightlessness.\nEleven untitled chapters flowing together: from zero BPM up to 130 BPM.\nLive percussion and field recordings create an organic sense of movement without relocation.\nA sonic reimagining of space and time.\nCD 3: Air III — Secret Heritage (1996)\nThe stage of expansion.\nA deeper integration of ethnic instruments, piano, string textures, and Eastern melodies.\n\"Oui\" is built almost entirely on ethnic arrangements, while \"Est-ce que l'amour fait mal?\" returns to deep bass, string harmonies, and ethereal vocals.\nCD 4: Air IV — Elle A Du Shell (1999)\nMusical alchemy.\nCaribbean jazz, electronic bebop, deep ambient, space trance, and ethno-electronics intertwine into a rich, multilayered composition.\nNamlook continues to break down genre boundaries, creating a new form of ambient music.\nCD 5: Air V — Jeux Dangereux (2006)\nThe final and most personal chapter.\nAccording to Pete Namlook himself, the album with the deepest emotional impact.\nAir V is a meditation on impossible love, light, and farewell.\nA long and maturing journey completed with a conscious and luminous finale.",

            "about": "Please, check the DIGITAL only preorder on the artist's page:  bvdub.bandcamp.com/album/the-depth-of-rain\n~\nSix years after \"A Thousand Words\" which was our first cooperation with bvdub, we're happy to make a new announcement - an absolutely new album by the ambient master. Over the years, bvdub has garnered international acclaim for his ability to craft music. Prepare to be taken on an emotive journey through soundscapes and atmospheres. bvdub's music transcends boundaries and speaks to the depths of the human experience, making this album a must-listen for all music\n~\n\"My first day in China after two years away, I noticed a strange round object on the table - not only in appearance, but because it emitted musical notes, and my girlfriend literally doesn't listen to music. Ever. Further inquiry revealed it was a handmade version of a steel tongue drum, made by her uncle for her niece, in the hopes that she would not only learn about music, but learn to love it. Neither of those came to pass.\nBut what remained was an object whose sounds I couldn't stop listening to. And couldn't stop speaking to me. That afternoon, I spent a half hour completely detached from the world while I randomly tapped its various notes, until reality called again.\nAs it always does.\nI knew I would need to do something more with that drum - not only\nfor myself, but for its creator and creation. One morning, I sat down in my studio, the torrential rain outside nearly deafening through the open window, and let myself go. In the drum. In its sound and intent. In the rain that seemed it would never end. As I thought about all that had\nbrought me back to the place where we existed together.\nAbout the life I had left but always wanted back - and all the joys and\nperils that come with wishes coming true.\nRecorded uninterrupted, live over 73 minutes, the session was then\nplayed back the same evening for the live electronic session that unfolded over it... one comprised of an infinite number of movements, from slight to sprawling, all bathed in a quiet restraint unlike any of my other work. Perhaps the result of its intent being about something bigger\nthan myself. Perhaps an unintentionally pure example of one loneliness\nexchanged for another in my strange form of coming home. Perhaps an\nunconscious show of humility in the face of life and the world.\nOr, perhaps, a contemplation on the true depth of rain it seemed would never end.\" - Brock Van Wey",

            "about": "\"The Doctrine of Maybeness\" by Aural Rage is an anthology of the\nworks of Danny Hyde’s Aural rage project, an engineer, Programmer,\nproducer, collaborator, remixer, and co-conspirator of Coil, Nine Inch\nNails, Psychic TV, Depeche Mode, and many others.\nA 15 year anniversary of musical adventure on 3xCDs with all works\ntogether - \"A Nature Of Nonsense\", \"Sinsemilla Dreams\" and \"Svay Pak\" with unreleased bonus tracks.\nOne of the early sampling Pioneers, producing 80’s band Savage\nProgress, a huge continental hit. Working with amongst others The The,\nsoft cell, and many more on Fairlights and Synclaviers. He contributed\nmany unique sounds to Coil’s legacy and worked on their legendary\nalbums Horse Rotovator and Love’s Secret Domain, onto The new\nBackwards. Coil lovers know that Hyde was a kind of a secret member\nfor this group.\nOn Aural Rage dark industrial-tinged electronica and moony-ambient\nmusic has broadened with synthetic strings, programmed rhythms, shuddering MDMA-filtered beats, acid gurgles and insect buzzes are all over the album. Believing that Humour can be the hidden violin in a piece. This anthology is a Cross-genre cocktail of various music styles, a pure experiment without any borders.\nThe project features following guest musicians: John Balance and\nPeter Christopherson aka Coil and Joanna de Seyne.",

            "about": "\"This album was inspired by some of my short trips, incursions to the lake Teletskoye (Altyn Kӧl - Golden Lake) in the Altai Mountains.\nOf all the indescribable beauty, what impressed me most was a fog flowing with streams down the wooded hills and cloaking the water glaze like a shroud.\nFoggy sunrises over the lake were not less (and perhaps more) magical than the twilight.\nThe oriflamme of the day already made themselves felt, but the mind was still on the whirlwind sidelines and out of the vanity of everyday cares when the line between sleep and wake is the most fragile.\nThis is the time of lucid dreaming: babbling brook, small splashing waves, a lonely fisherman cutting the watery mirror surface ...\nAnd somewhere in there, in inaccessible depth ... the depth of either dreams or the lake ... beneath of the surface of random thoughts, that run like circles on water, on the other side of the fog there is IT keeping out of sight.\nIs it the lonely fisherman that IT is looking for?\nSitting on the lakeshore by the very water, I was well aware of where the rumours of aquatic monsters come from different sides of the world.\nThis is a somewhat disturbing, but attractive by its uniqueness feeling, that when you look at the water rippling, there, out of all this depth of water, someone looks back at you ...\nBy evening, the fog again took what its own.\nAt first, the ghostly horizons lost the sight, then in the twilight mist, the opposite shore began to melt and then the surface of the lake conflated with a soaring haze, and only the outlines of the nearby houses, like anchors of habitual human world, still held perception.\nBut they dissolved too ...\nThere was only yourself next to the dying fire and ... but is there something else ... are there still you left?\nAfter all, even the stars were faded away ...\"",

            "about": "In 1984 VORTEX CAMPAIGN invited COIL and THE NEW BLOCKADERS to collaborate. The result, which was unofficially referred to as Dolbied, was released privately on cassette in an edition of 50. The release has since gone on to become legendary, showcasing two of the most influential groups in the scene at the early stages of their development. The Melancholy Mad Tenant is an authorized release, sanctioned by all three groups. The tracks have been professionally re-mastered and in addition to the COIL/THE NEW BLOCKADERS/VORTEX CAMPAIGN collaboration it also contains the entire VC archive, including two previously unreleased tracks. This wooden box edition hand-numbered and strictly limited to 100 copies only.\nMore info coming soon!\nReviews:\n'Historically potent reissue of some early, brutally primitive collaborations. Coil are in their early Zos Kia/Coil crossover mode generating some wild spectral energy via looped vocal trance and spooked, auroral tones while TNB generate huge boulders of cracked fuzz. The Vortex Campaign solo tracks are great examples of Equinox-era Punk-primitive electronic ritual and the whole package makes for a trip back to a wildly accelerated underground activity.' Volcanic Tongue\n'Both Coil and TNB began in the early '80s and have become major players in their specific musical territories. The two collaborations are familiar terrain for TNB but certainly shine new light on the formative years of Coil, as this is very different to their Scatology LP released the same year. It's nice to hear them from a different and slightly unexpected perspective.' Vital",

            "about": "“The Morden Tower Conjurations” has until now only been available as an unofficial release, mistakenly credited to Citipati. This is the first official release of this collection of tracks, culled from a session at Morden Tower in 1983.\nThese conjurations took place at Morden Tower in 1983 with a view to, perhaps, becoming the first Metgumbnerbone LP. Soon after, further summonings were undertaken in an abandoned railway tunnel. and the band thought they would make a better first album. Not long after that the celebrants enacted their duplicitous mummery once again within the ruins of industry which, of course, did become the first ‘bone LP “Ligeliahorn”. The tunnel summonings formed the backbone of “Druen”, and “The Morden Tower Conjurations” were all but forgotten about.\nNow, let us journey forth in time some forty English years and we get to wondering about whatever happened to those early ‘bone recordings. An initial inspection of THE METGUMBNERVAULTS proved unfruitful. Richard Rupenus (The New Blockaders) had made the original recordings but, unfortunately, didn’t know what had become of them. However, he did remember that he had made a copy of said recordings at the time for someone who had been there.\nAfter a long search for a story that is too long for a short press release but can be found online if you are curious, the entry has finally found its justifiable embodiment!",

            "about": "\"The New Backwards\" was conceived by Peter \"Sleazy\" Christopherson in 2007, revisiting stray tracks which hadn't seemed to gel with the material he had chosen for the more somber \"Ape of Naples\" from 2005, COIL's initial posthumous release, a sort of requiem and a kiss-goodbye to his then recently deceased partner John Balance.\nSignificantly different to its sister release, this album collects the brilliantly chaotic and outrageously rhythmic material from the original sessions for the album that was begun as early as 1993 and had originally been conceptualised as the follow-up to \"Love's Secret Domain\". These songs are as diverse and wild as the places they originated from, partly infamously spawned in Sharon Tate's former home in the Hollywood Hills, the Nine Inch Nails home base in New Orleans and London's Swanyard, co-composed, remixed and restructured with the help of long-term friend Danny Hyde in Thailand, this collection has its own unique flow and an atmosphere not found on any other COIL release.\nBoth \"AYOR\" and \"Backwards\" had by the time the album was first released already become favourites in COIL's manic live performances. Some of the other tracks had only leaked in demo versions and are here presented updated and polished as Christopherson and Hyde intended them to be heard. It is interesting to consider Balance's vocal contributions, too. Whilst on the albums COIL did release at the time this material was first put aside (\"Black Light District\" and \"ElpH\") his voice is all but absent, his vocal performances and his lyric writing here are arguably more closely indebted to the previous \"Love's Secret Domain\" era, especially the epic \"Copacaballa\" is noteworthy in that respect.\nThe New Backwards\" effectively became the final official COIL studio release of all new material whilst Peter was still alive and is here presented for the first time fully supervised by Danny Hyde, its co-creator.\nThe stunning cover uses a detail from artist Ian Johnstone's \"Cubic Raven\" painting, licensed from the estate of IJ..\nIt is high time to rediscover this timeless album with the Infinite Fog release, first time available on vinyl in its full form without 3 skipped tracks! Besides that boasting nine further tracks of previously unheard material from the same sessions, rough working stages and surprising remixes which will surely delight the dedicated COIL archaeologists, as they shine yet another light on the creative process and on what could have been.",

            "about": "The album ‘The Trail of Genghis Khan’ made by Cye Wood in collaboration with Lisa Gerrard is now officially released by Infinite For Productions and available on CD and VINYL.\nSourced from a material that Lisa and Cye produced for the documentary series ‘The Trail of Genghis Khan’, this album is an emotive interpretation of Tim Cope’s epic journey on horseback from Mongolia to Hungary (on which the doco is based). Drawing on inspiration from this rugged & majestic landscape and the culture & inhabitants of this unique part of the world, they have allowed their intuition to be the guiding force in the creation of these works.\nWhatever you know about Mongolia, hardly you could tell more than an Australian traveler Tim Kop, who left 3 years of his life in the marvelous Mongolian steppes, certainly taking with him far more impressions than many can take in his entire life. The film about this nomadic journey was released by the ABC Television Group and has received many awards, including National Geographic (Australian Geographic). Lisa Gerrard, widely known for her work in Dead Can Dance and the grandiose soundtracks, with the Australian violinist multi-instrumentalist Cye Wood, currently based in Berlin, portrayed the emotions and impressions of the epic journey in musical form.\nCye and Lisa, both extraordinary musicians who have devoted their entire lives to music since the early years, and it's no surprise that they could find the perfect mutual understanding and create such a wonderful album worthy of being named one of the best in the discography of both authors.\nCye already had experience working with Lisa Gerrard as a violinist on her solo album \"The Black Opal\" 2009. And a year later the first full-length joint work \"The Trail of Genghis Khan\" was ready.\nCharming melodies, excellent arrangements, perfectly balanced atmosphere and a bewitching plot of songs, all this in a compartment with the inimitable vocals of Lisa Gerard is \"The Trail of Genghis Khan\".\nCye’s work delves into many aspects of sound creation, including improvisation, composition, production, performance, sound installation, and field recording. His live and recorded work invokes a deep listening state, drawing audiences into familiar, yet uncharted territories.\nCye began studying classical violin at the age of 3, and was performing professionally by the age of 10. At the age of 14, he began working as a session musician, and it was during this time that his lifelong love affair with the recording studio began.\nHe has contributed string arrangements and solo violin to many albums and film projects and performed with a diverse array of artists including – Eartha Kitt, Sarah Blasko, Hein Cooper, Angus Stone, Yeshe, and many others.\nHis first release arrived in the form of ‘Araya’. Primarily consisting of piano, strings, field recordings, and solo violin, all 4 songs were performed and composed by Cye, and recorded and produced with engineer/producer Antony Payn.\nreviews:\n\"Though Lisa Gerrard will probably always be best known for her work in Dead Can Dance, the outfit she formed with fellow Australian Brendan Perry in the early ‘80s and with whom she released nine albums between 1984 and 1995, a collaborative project such as The Trail of Genghis Khan shows that her creative life didn't end with that celebrated project. Aside from her involvement in Dead Can Dance, she's issued solo albums (1995's The Mirror Pool, 2006's The Silver Tree, 2014's Twilight Kingdom), collaborations (with Pieter Bourke 1998's Duality and Patrick Cassidy 2004's Immortal Memory), and soundtracks (among the films and documentaries she's scored or contributed to are The Insider, Gladiator, Whale Rider, and Heat).\nFor the soundtrack album to the ABC documentary series The Trail of Genghis Khan, she found another kindred spirit in Berlin-based Cye Wood, a classically trained violinist and multi-instrumentalist who produces music under the Cave In The Sky name (Songhellir was released on 1631 Recordings in 2016) when not contributing scores to film projects (the award-winning short film Piercing Silence and feature film Hello Forever) and composing for contemporary dance productions.\nTo a large degree, the musical terrain explored in Wood's collaboration with Gerrard will seem like familiar territory to Dead Can Dance listeners. The ten tracks encompass a wide range of world music styles and instruments, with Eastern European and folk elements audible parts of the mosaic. As a child growing up in Melbourne, Gerrard absorbed the sounds of Greek, Turkish, and Irish melodies that flowed into the streets of her neighborhood, and it's certainly possible to hear evidence of that background in the soundtrack. The film itself traces the journey undertaken by Tim Cope on horseback from Mongolia to Hungary, and the composers naturally drew upon the landscapes and their inhabitants for inspiration during the music production process.\nBowed strings (violin and viola), percussion, lute, and acoustic guitar figure prominently, and a mournful, supplicating tone permeates many of the settings, evidenced most audibly in Gerrard's emotive, oft-wordless vocalizing. Music of such evocative character lends itself well to a soundtrack application, and even in the absence of the film's corresponding visuals images quickly form in response to the musical design; during “Call of the Steppes - Part I,” for example, visuals are hardly necessary when Gerrard's voice conveys sadness so hauntingly on its own. The Trail of Genghis Khan is the kind of project that lends itself naturally to accommodating a large number of traditional acoustic instrument sounds, and it's also not unusual for earthy chants and folk ballads to work their way into the presentation.\" May 2017 by  textura.org",

            "about": "\"Things That Were\", a luxurious limited 2CD Digibook edition of the earliest Lustmord recordings released by Infinite fog Production.\nThe album is carefully mastered by Peter Andersson(raison d'etre). Artwork Cold Graves.\nReviews:\n“The British scene has an established tradition of dark, avant-garde, and experimental industrial music, and “Things That Were” is one of those jewels that first grew in the UK in the late 70s and 80s. With this album (2CD Digibook set), released by Infinite fog Productions, Brian Williams a.k.a. Lustmord dives into his true and fundamental nature.\nHighly influenced by other contemporary acts, such as Brits Throbbing Gristle or Aussies SPK, with whom Lustmord himself collaborated as one of their multiple floating members, “Things That Were” offers a truly fundamental overview of the beginnings of this master – and theoretically father – of dark ambient. This work is a compilation of remastered early recordings of both live gigs and tracks recorded at the E.M.S. London studio enables listeners to better understand where all the magic and warm darkness that surrounds Lustmord’s subsequent albums come from.\nNot only will listeners notice the predominance of noise and industrial sounds in both the composition and performance of these tracks, but also the remarkable and incipient essence of what would later become the cornerstone of his rich and influential work. Elements such as anguished voices, the disturbing bells tolling in “Slabstone”, or those creepy kids playing and whispering songs in “Sibling”, have a terribly dark, and even warm, quality. These samples and field recordings, together with the drone-like layers used in most of the songs, provide the sound with a truly immersive and hypnotic mysticism, which sometimes approaches the post-punk and anti-rock bias that was the trademark of Coil’s and Psychic TV’s John Balance or Nocturnal Emissions’ Caroline K, to whom this album is a tribute.\nAs mentioned, “Things That Were” includes both live and studio recordings. The sound is awesome in both, which shows a great production effort, but above all, what will be of real interest to potential listeners, is the majesty and intensity of Mr. William’s performance. It really does sound dark, metallic, noisy, industrial…, and definitely turns the listener’s own surroundings into a creepy and obscure environment: amazingly enjoyable.\nIn summary, Lustmord’s raw and instinctive 80-83 recordings justify and give a clear perspective of his first steps and musical endeavors that would subsequently engender a fantastic chain of albums including “Heresy” – his masterpiece -, “Paradise Disowned” and his hypnagogic offering from last year, “The Word As Power”.\nIn order to better understand this pioneer’s work and how he has gradually matured into the figure he is today, this compilation of early recordings must be listened to carefully and stored alongside the prized possessions of every dark ambient and industrial music fan, to whom this release is one of the most eagerly awaited events of 2014. “Things That Were” has been kept in the dark for too long and it is now time to celebrate the fact that it has finally seen the light. Highly recommendable.” – S13  (secretthirteen.org)",

            "about": "The original release of Nurse with Wound's gargantuan \"Thunder Perfect Mind\" in 1992 coincided with that of Current 93's homonymous genre-defining album. Legend has it that the gnostic name initially appeared to Steven Stapleton in a dream as the title of Tibet's then still nameless upcoming album. Both records feature contributions from David Tibet, Colin Potter, Rose McDowall, John Balance of Coil, Alan Trench of Orchis and Joolie Wood amongst others. The title and the partial overlap of the personnel on both albums isn't quite where the similarities end, both albums have since become undisputed milestones in their respective artists' oeuvre. At the core of the definitive 2023 Infinite Fog re-release fully overseen by Steven Stapleton are the two original tracks \"Cold\" - a classic unsettling rhythmic Nurse collage-fest, significantly closer to jittery psychelia than the oft-cited \"industrial feel\" and the epic \"Colder Still\", easily one of the most mind-bending breathtaking NWW compositions up to this point and well beyond. The track soothes ghostly atmosphere and reveals new surprises with every listen, not least of which is a direct link to its sister release from c93 as well as the first appearance of the signature rhythm loop that would mutate and re-emerge on several later tracks. The album also is the first full-length collaboration with genius sound wizard Colin Potter who has since become a ubiquitous sidekick both on Nurse albums as well as in live performances. As a follow-up to what is widely acknowledged as one of the best-loved exercises in drone of the 20th century \"Soliloquy for Lilith\", TPM is a much more varied but at least equally rewarding experience. Infinite Fog are beyond pleased to be able to offer a significantly enhanced, remastered and extended 3 LP version for old and new fans alike.",

            "about": "Words are not enough to describe the visceral feelings that Transformalin delivers, but this sound-therapy will cure your soul or make you total sick!\nThis project’s sole member is Nattramn, whose ‘Death—Pierce Me’ album under the project name Silencer stand as defining work in the suicidal black metal movement. Diagnose: Lebensgefahr is significantly different from either, though, and should not be considered a black metal album as such. For the first time this album blew up the world in 2007 and now it's still one of the most interesting works on current scene.\nTransformalin is a bleak voyage through related genres, particularly dark ambient, power electronics, martial and noise-influenced industrial, with black metal serving as the filter that taints and completes them. Consequently, ‘Transformalin’ is a jarring experience that can be harshly rhythmic at one moment and the next dive into unmetered, dragging ambience, while still others draw on martial cadences and horn reveries that echo in the background. Though mostly instrumental, he does provide ‘narration’ from time to time with primarily clean vocals that range from manically impassioned to psalm-tone catatonia.\nLast years it became extremely rare album and now, 5 years later, this black pearl is available again! This time with the expanded booklet on 16 pages which was specially developedover by the well-known artist Costin Chioreanu (drawing for Grave worked; Darkthrone; Demonical; Aura Noir; My Dying Bride; Arcturus, Trencadis; Arktau Eos and many other). Masterfully executed, under the sensitive management of Nattramn'a, drawings, are your silent conductors on desert corridors of Diagnose: Lebensgefahr.",

            "about": "Mexican duo Ford Proco with their famous and long-time sold out album \"Vertigo De Lodo Y Miel\". Reissue will be avalaible via Infinite Fog Productions since 12.12.2016.\nFord Proco, an act considered highly influential in Mexico’s industrial electronic music scene. \"Vertigo De Lodo Y Miel\" bands second album was release in 2000 and recorded featuring COIL !\nNew version comming in Digipak and limited to 400 copies only.\nReviews:\n“Hailing from electronically fertile Tijuana, techno iconoclasts Wito Lavot and Roberto Castañeda are Ford Proco. A collaboration with members of like-minded veteran British acid-house outfit Coil (John Balance and PeterChristopherson), Vértigo De Lodo Y Miel (Vertigo of Mud and Honey) delves\ninto nearly two decades of ambient dance sounds, recalling moments of '80s industrial techno (\"Abzeichnen\") and melodic pop grooves. The dreamy \"SSW\" and \"FM Road\" feature guest vocalists Chuy Picos and Iaia Morfin (Nona Delichas). Adhering to the Nimboestatic aesthetic of ethereal moods and textures, Vértigo brings an avant-garde, futurist feel to the table, defiantly proving it's light years away from most Latin alternative fare.\nThis album could easily be spun alongside the likes of Pole, Einstürzende Neubauten and Nortec Collective member Bostich, who offers a remix of \"FM Road.\" Careful when looking down.” - CMJ New Music Report\n~~\nInfinite fog Productions has announced the reissue for a pair of collaborations between Coil and Mexican duo Ford Proco, an act considered highly influential in Mexico’s industrial electronic music scene.\nThe collaboration came about after Coil and Throbbing Gristle’s Peter ‘Sleazy’ Christopherson met the act’s Robert Proco and Wito Lavolt while watching The Orb perform in Los Angeles in the late 90s. They exchanged contact details, and a few months later, Christopherson called up the pair to ask if they wanted to be in a music video he was directing – Ice-T and Body Count’s ‘Born Dead’.\nFollowing that unlikely team-up, the Mexican duo worked on a pair of tracks with Christopherson and Coil vocalist John Balance, which ended up on Ford Proco’s Vertigo De Lodo Y Miel album, released in 2000.\nInfinite fog will reissue “Vertigo De Lodo Y Miel” on limited to 400 copies Digipak with new artwork – you can listen to both tracks below, which are a lot like you’d expect a collaboration formed at an Orb gig to sound.",

A different facet of creativity, in a new sound.\nVINTERSOLVERV - a kind of homage to Vyacheslav to the music that influenced him at the very beginning of his musical career, one can say - inspired him to make a decision to start writing his own. Empyrium, Ulver, Vali, Nest, October Falls... We hope that the fans of these projects receive another one quiet acoustic album for the melancholic winter evenings.\nVINTERSOLVERV in translation \"Winter Solstice\", and the title of the debut album of the project is translated as \"Through the hoarfrost on the branches\". The mastering of the album was handled by Martin Bous of ATTRITION himself.",

            "about": "Originally released as a small run cassette in 1987, only to fall into tape label obscurity, Robert Turmans industrial genre-bending masterpiece album Way Down finally has been excavated for a proper vinyl reissue after twenty-three years in the shadows. This album solidifies Turman as a cut above the rest with respect to his talent and his natural ear for experimental composition. Turman first came onto the industrial scene in the late 70s as the ominous other half of legendary noise outfit NON, alongside Boyd Rice, together releasing the now classic first NON single, Mode of Infection/Knife Ladder 7” in 1977. After parting ways, Turman went on an excursion of self-released cassettes to which he fused every possible influence at his disposal, culling together past habits of experimental know-how and going forward into uncharted terrain. After his previous experimental efforts included on his Flux release in 1981, and even later in the prolific Chapter Eleven boxset, Turman turned the tables with the creation of Way Down, using synthesizer arrangements and drum machines alongside guitar solos, piano chords, tape loops and primitive sampling to create a whole new concoction of dance-like minimal synth blended together with the industrial darkwave noise he was mostly known for. After almost vanishing from the music scene, Turman resurfaced in 2005, teaming up with seminal noise musician Aaron Dilloway to not only reissue previous recordings, but to record and perform once again with new releases out on Hanson and Medusa. This vinyl reissue of Way Down serves as the blueprint of what Turman sought to render as a very accessible minimal synth/industrial album, yet keeping it just obtuse enough to make it one of the most brilliant and engaging albums to be ushered into the canon of 80s experimental culture.\nREVIEWS:\n\"The overall atmosphere of ‘Way Down’ is dark but never overly oppressive due to Turman’s brilliantly executed balance of melody and texture. A stone-cold classic.\" - 10/10 - Ant (Norman Records Zine)\n\"Turman’s contribution to the industrial and synth wave underground in the late 1970s and 80s was unique and substantial. He first rose to prominence as part of NON, collaborating with Boyd Rice on the classic 1977 single ‘Mode of Infection’/'Knife Ladder’, before leaving to pursue his own more expansive solo vision.\nTurman released a number of cassettes over the course of the 80s, drawing on a wide range of experimental techniques. On Way Down, first released on Actual Tapes in 1987, he combined the psych noisy industrial drone aesthetic he was best known for with a spry, danceable minimal synth sound, albeit one fleshed out with guitars, pianos, tape loops and samples. Cold, but not too dark, with a reliance on melody not expected from this area of music. It’s a great record, murky as hell but also engaging and accessible. Robert Turman is one of the most underrated figures to come out of industrial music’s earliest days. “Way Down” is a cold 80's freak-out.\" Elvis Von Doom",

            "about": "Yes, your eyes tell you the truth – this is the first new record by Zero Kama released since 2008 live vinyl! During these 16 years Zoe Dewitt was active with book publishing, Zero Kama and Korpses Katatonic reissues, lectures, scientific research, exhibitions, and rare but bright live shows. However, most of us have forgotten our dreams of seeing new releases of Zero Kama.\nOriginally, \"What is a Body\" is the 50-minute background soundtrack for Zoe Dewitt's lecture performance in the anatomical theatre of the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in 2015. Exclusively based on samples from \"The Secret Eye of LAYLAH\" it takes you to the same Zero Kama you always known - dark ritual music with transcendent drones and tribal parts. The music is not to talk about but to listen and disappear in.\nBlack vinyl, colored vinyl, and the DigiCD. The vinyl comes with a big booklet about the record conception and the lecture by Zoe Dewitt.",

            "about": "Zero Kama was an experimental music project founded by Zoe DeWitt in 1983. The first release of Zero Kama was the title V.V.V.V.V., recorded for the Nekrophile Rekords cassette compilation The Beast 666. In 1984 followed the cassette release of the album The Secret Eye of L.A.Y.L.A.H., which is commonly regarded as one of the key albums of the industrial-subgenre 'ritual'. The fact that all instruments used for this recording were exclusively made from human bones and skulls, its elusive musical style, the implied occult symbolism as well as the short-time existence of Zero Kama, whose backgrounds remained unknown for a long time, have been contributing to the cult status of this project until now.\nFollowing an invitation of the NL-Centrum Amsterdam, Zero Kama played two live concerts in the Netherlands in 1985, and - after two more releases on the Nekrophile compilation The Archangels of Sex Rule the Destruction of the Regime - completely withdrew from the public. While The Secret Eye of L.A.Y.L.A.H. was recorded solely by Zoe DeWitt, the later live performances were realized with befriended musicians such as Didi Neidhart and Muki Pakesch, whom Zoe DeWitt knew from the Austrian music underground of the 1980s.\nSince that time there have been a couple of re-releases of Zero Kama recordings, amongst others the 1988 Vinyl version by the French label Permis de Construire, followed by the CD release in 1991. In 2001 the French label Athanor published The Goatherd and the Beast, a 10\" vinyl containing tracks from various compilations that were recorded besides The Secret Eye of L.A.Y.L.A.H.. This collection was also included as a bonus CD in the Live in Armhem double CD release by Athanor in 2008. In 2014 Athanor finally published a remastered version of The Secret Eye of L.A.Y.L.A.H. as both vinyl and CD.\nInfinite fog Productions presents an anthology release of Zero Kama. The first time ever, everything recorded by the project released as one set on limited CD, VINYL and CASSETE. Recordings transferred from original tapes, carefully mastered by Martin Bowes at the Cage Studios and Micro Majong at Micro Majong Studio. Designed by Cold Graves.\nDelux collector's 3xLP BOX, 8-sided 3xCD Digipak and hand-numbered 2xTAPE edition available to a preorder now!",

            "about": "For sure not one of the best known acts from Russia, but a must have for connoisseurs and scene specialists! Limited to 300 copies only!\nDER GOLEM – one of the biggest CULT acts from Russia (ceased to exist) was created in 1999 by musicians Dmitry Zubov (Hypnoz) and Roman Sidorov (Staruha Mha, Fatal, Sedativ). Their sound stands out from anything you might have heard from Russia and represents a strange and unique mix of Industrial, Post Rock, Shoegazer, Ambient; Post-punk. In 1999 and 2000 they created 2 albums, which made a huge impact on the Russian underground. Both musicians are dead: Roman Sidorov ended existence in September 2003, Dmitry Zubov in November 2011. This double-CD is an anthology, combining most of the material ever released by DER GOLEM plus some previously unreleased live-recordings.\n--\nold reviews:\nZmet:\n\"...The genius of the person is felt at once and reflected in everything what this person touches. In their music is total penetrating depressivnost and the sheer minor. Rock on sides with industrial, peculiar dark ambient which was perceived precisely in the widest value of it term. The slow rhythm of percussions hypnotizes, the vocal bewitches, the sound of a guitar introduces in acoustic space, any other-wordly uneasiness...\"\nDiscipline of the blown-up bridges:\n\"...The dirty industrial sound made generally by means of an electric guitar and old analog synthesizers. The material excellent and behind music is felt not hefty spirit of her founders. It is classics of a domestic industrial underground...",
