            "about": "An Axis of Perdition's journey is a compelling saga of evolution and experimentation within the industrial extreme metal landscape. Formed in the early 2000s, the band harnessed their experiences with mental illness and the unsettling backdrop of Middlesbrough to craft a sound that melds dissonance with visceral intensity. Their early releases, like The Ichneumon Method and Deleted Scenes From The Transition Hospital, showcased their ability to blend harsh industrial elements with intricate metal compositions, earning them critical acclaim and a devoted following. The ambitious concept albums Urfe and Tenements pushed the boundaries even further, weaving a nightmarish narrative that reflected their unique aesthetic. After a brief hiatus and eventual dissolution, the duo's return in 2019 marked a resurgence of creativity, culminating in the 2024 release of Apertures. This album not only encapsulates their signature sound but also pushes into new realms of surrealism and atmospheric depth. With their recent partnership with Apocalyptic Witchcraft, An Axis of Perdition continues to redefine their musical landscape, offering listeners a haunting and immersive experience that remains distinctively their own.\nMichael Blenkarn-Durning comments:\n\"An Axis of Perdition are delighted to join forces with Apocalyptic Witchcraft - a fresh and vital voice for quality new extreme music. We look forward to toxifying ears and minds worldwide with their connivance, long past the point where they bitterly regret it (if they do not already).\"",

            "about": "Created in 2012 using reconfigured and remixed material from the ‘Urfe’ album and the sessions from which it arose, ‘Effluvia’ presents three immersive ambient excursions into the damaged landscape of Locus Eyrie. The sounds of ‘Urfe’ mingle here, nurtured and reshaped, transgressing the relations the album had established, interjected with the wreckage that might have been. As such it presents an alternative aperture to that traumatic world without its guiding voice, shedding light onto its twisted underbelly.\nSecreted jealously by the band in the years since as their own private umbilicus to the unique headspace that existed around the making of that album, they now offer it up to public view, as a window to peer from the contemporary vantage of self-isolation into the hidden depths of a darker place.",

            "about": "File under: Industrial Black Metal\nInfo: “Tenements…” is an album that cuts to the very heart of The Axis Of Perdition and exposes the diseased core with a violence, depth and derangement that is so far unmatched in the band's discography. Haunting, moving, excruciating and excoriating in equal measure, it is an album that demands attention from start to finish and will leave no listener untouched.\n\"If you like experimental, atmospheric, industrial, progressive black metal and you like it to sound like it's crawling out of the sewers, look for this.\"\nDon't count on it - 9,5/10\n\"As always, Tenements succeeds through pure overwhelming force, beating the listener into a state of slack-jawed submission as it pours in the poisons through the porches of the ears.\"\nMetal Review - 8,7/10",

            "about": "File Under: Axis is glyph. Logos of abomination. Neither life nor death, between the many ciphers of absence\nInfo: Urfe is a broken man, just one despairing voice among the multitude of lost souls in the doomed nowhere town of Locus Eyrie. Coerced into a quest for answers by an anonymous letter, Urfe is drawn into a waking nightmare where the shadows of his past shape a reality that is rapidly disintegrating around him. Hounded ever further into his self-made hell by the wretched denizens of the dark, and tempted ever onward by the enigmatic Pylon, Urfe discovers that salvation and healing come at a cost so desperate that neither can be trusted for what they seem.Urfe, the new album from The Axis Of Perdition, finds the band deeper into their idiosyncratic vision than ever before. A labyrinthine journey through the dark terrain of their subconscious, Urfe draws on a wealth of classic industrial, dark ambient and cinematic music and threads it together with a fevered, psychedelic part-narrative part-poetic performance from actor Leslie Simpson (Dog Soldiers, The Descent, Doomsday, Beyond The Rave). The result is their most harrowing, dysfunctional and personal album to date, drawing musical influence from Swans, Godflesh, Esoteric, Angelo Badalamenti and the finest of Industrial music from Throbbing Gristle onwards. With Urfe, The Axis Of Perdition transcend their humble origins and make music that is both their most uncompromising and their finest.",
