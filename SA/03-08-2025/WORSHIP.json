Crushing, numbing and brilliant.'",

Oh, and it’s interesting to see more openly sexual track titles being used- for the first time in Worship's releases.\"\n\"It’s a clever, if at times slightly mentally frustrating ‘wall’ that really rewards more focused listening. Both are decidedly creative takes on this most extreme of sound forms.",

            "about": "50 Minutes.\n3 Walls.\n15 pictures of cover girl Fernande Barrey included in the download.\nThank you Yann and Camembert Electrique for the release, guidance and beautiful words about this record.\ncamembertelectrique.bandcamp.com\nwww.instagram.com/camembertelectrique_\n\"Mood Swinger\" is very beautiful and very successful, because once our ears get used to the noise sound, we discover behind dark ambient parts.\n\"Le boudoir\" is more difficult to access, but the same behind the storm, we hear small heady samples. It is a track to listen with closed eyes to discover the different variations. It is clear that there is something going on behind this wall!\n\"Joyeuse Fin\" is similar to the beginning track: a very dark ambient and Science Fiction atmosphere. We are attracted to great intergalactic spaces. The wall of noise lets us once again guess some more subtle ambiences behind.",

            "about": "I am deeply honoured to say that 'FOCUS' is in Roger from Musique Machine's Top 5 Albums Of The Year. You can see the full list here -\nwww.musiquemachine.com/articles/articles_template.php?id=596\nHe also reviewed it with some lovely words here -  www.musiquemachine.com/reviews/reviews_template.php?id=10004\n\"one feels like you have been engulfed by some vast piece of chopping, rolling, and churning machinery\"\n\"haunting almost harmonic mid-ranged drone, and from time to time we can make out the skittering ‘n’ hazed hoover.\"\n\"Focus is yet another highly skilled & creative take on the walled / textured noise genre. With the looped, but building industrial-toned elements rather bringing to mind Aube’s work with chains & metallic elements\".",

Another fine release from the project, and great to hear about its growth/ progression.'\nwww.musiquemachine.com/reviews/reviews_template.php?id=10671\nThank you Spectrasonic Sound for playing 'Addictive Aroma'\nwww.mixcloud.com/spectrasonicsound/the-institute-of-spectra-sonic-sound-92124/",

            "about": "The cover model is Clara Ruby-Black.This album is intended to be more aligned with earlier WORSHIP albums in its simplicity and innocence.\nThank you Musique Machine for beautiful words about this one. A few highlights here:\n\"Ruby features two examples of pummelling, yet cosily encasing wall-craft from Worship\n“Cherry”, The ‘wall’ feels akin to watching an evenly blowing sheet, or maybe a boat sail on a slightly warming summer's day. Though the ‘wall’ is persistently battering in it’s flow, there is something rather comfy and soothingly enchanting about the whole thing.\n“Return To Innocence”, For this ‘wall’ I’m getting images of being slowly hit around the head with multiple pillows. The whole thing features a most effective feeling of gently slowing, with at points you thinking the whole thing will grind to a stop- but of course it never does, as it’s just a trick of the ‘wall’.\nRuby takes in two rewardingly examples of the wall-noise, and I particularly enjoy the feeling of comfy battering, which both of them have in their structure/ textural flow. With the 1920’s model theme nicely fitting the ‘walls’ vibe/ feel very well.\"\nwww.musiquemachine.com/reviews/reviews_template.php?id=9077",

            "about": "Thank you Musique Machine once more for very nice words: (abridged text here)\n“Don’t Look Away” - buffeting ‘n’ baying rumble surrounded by a growing selection of rattling ‘n’ shaking sub-tones, with the thickness of the whole thing growing fast. Throughout the ‘wall’ retains an uncertain feeling, which I guess nicely works with the theme of being in the company of someone unpredictable, possible unbalanced who is just staring at you.\n“Deadly” - slowly glowing web of sub-tones, which take in purred rattles, constantly rolling spins, and focused shaking.\nOnce again, The Stare finds Worship trying to do something a little different, and interestingly themed within the ‘wall-noise’, without stepping too far out of the restraints of the genre- which is a difficult thing to do. This is certainly a project to keep an eye on!\nwww.musiquemachine.com/reviews/reviews_template.php?id=9238",

Thoughts is another well-conceived and engaging release from Worship\".",

            "about": "Thank you Musique Machine for wonderful words about this album. Here is an abridged version below:\nWHIRR severs us up two just over half-hour slices of walled noise craft from the decidedly mysterious Worship. The project theme all of their releases around the naked female form, and often add in quite creative tendencies to their work.\n“Purr”. The title is very apt, as the wall is built around a tight, taut and slightly beaded bass purr-which edged by a controlled buffeting ‘n’ baying tone. The whole thing has a wonderful sense of thick bass-bound hover, which seems to be buzzy and lightly caresses your sonic sensors.\n“Headspin”: a most fitting title. The ‘wall’ has a decidedly warped quality- The layers seem to bleed ‘n’ blend into one another in a most wonkily appealing manner- you try to keep following the patterns, but your minds constantly grabbing at their tails as the whole thing seems to warp more and more….but as always with walled noise, this could all be a trick of the ‘wall’.\nOne of the most interesting/ consistent wall noise projects to appear in the last few years.\nwww.musiquemachine.com/reviews/reviews_template.php?id=9308",
