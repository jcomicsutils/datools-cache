            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'I had to dish out the big bucks to get a copy of this one. I don't know how many copies there are of this album (the group are known to release the same album in different editions), but my copy which comes with a poster by band member HEXIT (MjK) is limited to only 32 copies (!!). Only two extended jams on this album, but if you like the group at their most exotic and mind-expanding, then this is not to be missed. The first track reminds me of Tago Mago-era Can, especially the Damo Suzuki-like vocal rants of the first track. The jams shift gears often enough to keep your attention throughout. At times it will pound away in your ears like a violent tribal ceremony, begging you to get up and dance yourself into a frenzied trance while at others, the music's LSD-tinged sounds will peel away your cerebral cortex so you may feast at the goo inside. Completely fried music for the completely fried individuals out there. Finger licking good stuff'",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man - Acid-X\nOriginally Released in 2008 on Ed Hardiman's label, Tape Drift, on cassette in a one-time edition of 100 copies. Artwork by Sarah O'Shea.\nRecorded October 25, 2007 in Saarlouis, Germany.\nJohn Moloney - Electronics & Drums\nSarah O'Shea - Electronics & Vocals\nRon Schneiderman - Guitar & Electronics\nRobert Thomas - Bass & Electronics\nGozzy - Wheels / Map\nMathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" says:\nIf things go on this way, I'm afraid Sunburned will be releasing their albums exclusively on tape! Acid-X is a live concert performed back in October 2007 in Germany. The sound quality is above average (even better than some of the loft material!) and finds the band in a heavily drug-enhanced mood. The music on the album just oozes and drips with psylocibin-tinged noises and electro-clinks and clunks. Like legendary german hippy collective Amon Düül were they recording themselves during a particularly nasty bad LSD trip, Acid-X can sometimes show it's darker side. At one point in the song, when some initially amusing laughs suddenly turn into blood curdling screams that sound like M.I.A. being attacked by a pack of man-eating tigers, I swear I almost shit my pants. When not bent on freaking the living crap out of you, Acid-X can be a pretty trippy experience. The latter half of the album (mostly side B) is particularly kick ass and cool.",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man - Anatomy\nMH24 - originally released as a cdr in 2005.\nArtwork by Robert Thomas.\nThe group tracks were recorded by Tony Goddess at his studio beneath the old Mystery Train Records, in Gloucester, MA, in 2002? I dont remember. This was our first time in a recording studio. The segways were done by Rob Thomas at the Loft.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website: \"After starting off with the exact same kind of spoken word intro as on No Magic Man, I thought I would be getting something similar; instead of getting some weird and heavy stoner album, you get a pretty funky psyche album similar to the earlier Jaybird and Wildanimal. There's definitely some funk back in this album even though it is watered down and further spread apart by a few strange numbers. Some themes reoccur in different forms throughout the record; The Hand Job, The Hand Shake, The Handout and The Hand Off for example are the aforementioned spoken word bits; Eyelash and Eyelid are like a long jam separated by one weird and dreamy tune (Cavity). Some of these tracks are just plain fucked as with Facelift with it's crying samples or the similar Gland Jive and it's constant laughing. The record is quite good but it sounds pretty primitive and thin; skin and bones aesthetics.\"",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'What's this? Sunburned covering The Residents? Well no, but Inside/Outside sure resembles the eye-balled ones' odd nursery rhyme and schizophrenic aesthetics. The album becomes substantially darker from the very next track onwards. Starting with Shiv Giver we are immediately dragged down into a world of horrible experiments meant to dehumanize the listener. Most of these tracks are fucked up, drone works which could very well be the sounds of elaborate machines made to calculate the spectral ratio of asylum inmates during the 40s! Attica Rectangle might be on the noisier side of the Sunburned spectrum, yet these noises are so peculiar they don't sound like anything they've ever done before! This is what it sounds like when the band is let loose in a genetic engineering lab, surrounded by surreal machinery with organic tools and mutants in glass jars. Can't wait to see the results of this experience.'",

            "about": "Thurston Moore / John Moloney\n“Banjaxed Blues”\noriginally relases as a double cassette edition of 40, then a single cassette and finally as a 2LP Edition of 270 Manhand / FT Records- 2014\nThe third live set by the improvising duo, Caught on Tape. Comprised of drummer John Moloney (Sunburned, Chelsea Light, Home Comfort, etc.) and guitarist Thurston Moore (Coachmen, Dapper, the Din, etc.), Caught On Tape is found here to be in both expansive and contractive modes. As always, much of the sonic structure involves head-birth/freak-register guitar rampagement running into caveman stomps head-on. But there are also reflective passages this time, such as the false bell sequence in “Banjaxed Blues” (a song title worthy of MV/EE). There’s even an actual song. Indeed, the hot run-through of “Staring Statues” (from Thurston’s ’95 solo album, Psychic Hearts) might even be enough to make the pop sissies out there weeping for a few minutes, before the huzz raises its beautifully ugly head once again. The gatefold cover has stickered art by Moloney, Greta Svalberg and Ted Lee. The label art is by Emma Kohlmann. The sounds are nuts. And there are 270 numbered copies, so jump like a trout or die like a dog. As always, the choice is yours. – Byron Coley, 2014",

At the time, I felt like it was a waste of our time and energy, I was feeling cranky about taking apart the entire home studio to bring it out to this event. I was so down on it that i refused to set up drums and just dismissed the set in my head. Flash forward to Oct 9, 2022, I'm on a plane from London to Dublin, Ireland looking out the window at the white water over the Irish Sea in between Wales and Ireland and I put this on my headphones and it made the most amazing soundtrack to a beautiful plane ride. So, here it is.",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nThe Sunburned clan dedicated this live recording to a {2004 World Series} baseball game between the Red Sox and Cardinals (where the Sox won 6-2 by the way). The five tracks here are all instrumental with practically no vocals. These live jams are quite funky with a touch of free jazz at times (especially on Errorful Development). It reminds me of the group's earlier efforts like Jaybird or Wildanimal; after a slew of completely fucked up releases, the collective seems to have headed back to more approachable work instead of all out noise and weirdness. This album along with Blues For Jaco had been announced on the band's website for the longest of time and I was starting to get desperate to find a copy. So I paid over thirty dollars for my copy on eBay only to see it be released not even a week later. Oh well! At least I got bonus stuff with it. The CD-R comes in a thick printed paper folded unevenly.",
            "credits": "released January 13, 2015\nBlues For Game 2 - Manhand 22 - 2006\nThis is a soundboard recording from a live show at The Middle East Downstairs. Other bands on the bill were Cul De Sac and Major Stars. Because the 2004 World Series was on, and Boston hadn't made it there in a hundred years, the place was EMPTY. We had a blast though. One of Sunburned's best big band sets and a rare one with Rob on guitar for the set.",

It was Ron's cat and it died in a fire (which almost claimed Ron's life as well as is noted on the insert) two weeks prior to the recording of this live gig. The show took place in Dublin, Ireland and is dedicated to - you guessed it - Jaco! I must say I love the turn the band has taken with these last few recordings. They certainly kick out the jams more than they did on some of their more bizarre outings like Zample or Manhunt. It's certainly really heavy in the percussion department; the drums are downright insane at times! And when the guitar fuzz and noises join in and swell up into a frenzy of funky, heavy psych, it's practically overwhelming. The level of energy that comes out of the speakers is crazy; I couldn't possibly imagine what it must have been like to see the actual show. Some parts are so good, they even remind me of the heavier moments on that crazy Pärson Sound record.'",

            "about": "Bootcamp : Moses - 1996-1997\nThe Loft Tapes Volume 1 - MH 69\nOriginally released in 2008 as a 4 cassette box set in 2 editions of 20.\nThese recordings document some of the time period between Shit Spangled Banner and Rob coming up with the Sunburned band name. This material was recorded at the C.O.N. (Sunburned) Artists Loft, 7 Sherman Street, Charlestown, MA. Memories are hazy and the original liner notes are not very informative.\nWe used to hang out together every night, play music, drink, trip, and listen to records. Tons of people came by. In 1996, I believe that the residents of the loft were, Kristen Anderson, Rob Thomas, Angela Sawyer, Joe Malinowski, and James Coleman? I'm not sure...We were making a lot of movies around this time too, as much movies as music. This was our group therapy. Enjoy.\nTape 1 : 1-2-3 LSD\n1. Chad Cooper, John Moloney, Robert Thomas, Dennis Norton. Recorded in 1996\n2. Banjotown - Robert Thomas, Morgan, Cousin Rich, Chad Cooper, John Moloney\nTape 2: Glimpse\nConrad Capistran, Robert Thomas, Cousin Richard Thomas, John Moloney\nTape 3: Fourth of July 1996 - Where were you?\nTape 4: Train Track\nNew Gang Jack",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Sunburned have always sounded pretty out-there. Sometimes the dementia is simply way too fucked up and confusing (Zample, Weekend At Burnie's 2), while at others it is contained within a more recognizable \"rock group\" context (Jaybird, Double Puberty), but on some rare occasions, they seem to find a comfortable spot somewhere in between. Not since The Secret In Disguise have I found Sunburned to sound this fascinating and unique... there's simply nothing else like it in their huge output and that, to me, makes this album stand out above the rest. So what's so special about Charlie's Itch? I wouldn't even know where to begin! Try and imagine Wolf Eyes' jamming with Boards Of Canada using only garage sale toasters and a broken humidifier as their sole equipment. Electronics feature much more prominently than usual, but the way these sounds are (ab)used and the lo-fi quality of the recording make this album one hell of psychedelic mind-fuck.'",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nOf all the recent releases by Sunburned to have come out in 2008, this is their tightest effort yet. The album is definitely more homogenous regardless off how extreme things sometimes get. Intimate Woodwork starts the album off with a bang as bizarre assorted noises come at us from all sides (imagine John Zorn's Locus Solus). Things become slightly Vibracathedral-esque on Remote Dickhead Parachute, and from then on we are pushed and shoved, back and forth as the Sunburned ones seem fit: fucked up snippets of noise (Dogfood, Baseball), old-school stoner jams (Night Exam, Chinese Perfume) and some of the most psychedelic numbers since The Secret In Disguise (Iron Language Captive is easily my favorite track on the album). The album might sound all-over-the-place at first, but there's this indiscernible theme and flow that makes this a smooth listen after repeated listens. Chinese Perfume is 2008's first must own Sunburned release!",
            "credits": "released January 1, 2008\nChinese Perfume - Manhand 70 - 2008\nThis is a soundboard recording from Sunburned's second time playing at Vera in Groningen, Netherlands-2007. This release was 100% put together by Sunburned's Rob Thomas - edits, art, titles...a recent listen was stunning because i dont remember a thing about playing this wildly psychedelic music let alone what events led to Gozzy, our legendary, heroic, and now retired driver from Leeds, to get on the mic...",

            "about": "Sunburned - Chisled\nLive Burn 9 - Corsica Studios, London April 4 & August 27, 2006\n2006 was a wildly busy year for us. It was the first time we played at Corsica Studios in the Elephant & Castle neighborhood of London. We had a really good time there.\nApril 5 was an especially wild day because we came straight from the recording session of what became Fire Escape with Kieran Hebden (fourtet) loaded in and played for another heated 3 hours.\nIt went so well that we came back in August to do it again.\nMusic played by Sunburned:\nPhil Franklin\nGozzy\nMJK\nJohn Moloney\nMarc Orleans\nRon Schneiderman\nRobert Thomas\nKeith Wood\nwith very special guests, Mick Flower, Bridget Hayden, and Tom Kirton.\nCDs will be available in London at Cafe Oto, this Friday and here in our merch store soon.\nThis is dedicated to Pete Coward & Marc Orleans.",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nI was planning on getting rid of the cassette version of Civil Complaint when I purchased this CD-R edition, but seeing as how different both versions, I decided to keep both. Not sure of the differences exactly, the CD-R seems to contain the same music as the tape, but with a few extras and different edits. Regardless of the variations, I prefer the CD-R edition simply for the convenience of the media and considering that Civil Complaint finds the collective in their trippy-hippy mode, it will be listened to much more often than the tape version. The first two tracks alone make this a must have Sunburned release for all you fans out there, but having three (I believe) bonus tracks tacked on doesn't hurt either. Particularly good is the fourth untitled track which will probably make you want to try and fly (stay far away from tall buildings and ledges). CD-R comes housed in an oversized folded piece of thick paper with the same artwork found on the tape.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection\" website:\n\" noise, cough, wheeze, honk, mongoloid grunt, kerplunk, thud, whimper, sigh, moan, whizz, scream, kisses, cries. If all these noises excite you, then this is the record for you. Add some delay effects and even more noises (like boing, twing, zip and bubble) and you know what this Sunburned Hand Of The Man record is all about (at first I thought this album was credited to the \"Clear People\", but Moloney confirmed it is actually a SHOTM album). They've explored similar territory before so I wasn't at all surprised to hear this particular excursion. Personally, this is not really my cup of tea; arrhythmical tribal beats, random cartoon noises and caveman grunts doesn't always do it for me (although Fantômas have excited my braincells at times doing the exact same thing). Maybe there's this top secret concept behind this record, or maybe it's just about the squink, blurble and kuff-ah.\"",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nThe first double album by the Sunburned ones. There's a lot to digest here, but it's all pretty whacked-out stuff and not a dull moment in sight. There are two longer jams, both over twenty minutes long and both have this Sun Ra influence we've heard on earlier releases. One of the best tracks on here is Spinelight, with it's beautiful guitar riff which sounds like a ghostly chime over slow tribal drums and a funky bassline. Very psychedelic and contemplative. Another highlight is Wishbone. This track has a great guitar melody and junky-era John Frusciante-like vocal yelps behind thick distortion. Too bad this one is so short.'",
            "credits": "released January 6, 2015\nCloser To The Bone - Manhand 9 & 10 - 2004\nOriginally released ad a Sunburned double-cdr. This record documents a very crucial season of the group's activity at the Sunburned loft in Charlestown, Massachusetts. Essential listening.

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'The quality of the Sunburned Hand Of The Man's discography might vary quite a bit, but when their standards are high, the results are usually amazing! This is one of those cases. Imagine yourselves Throbbing Gristle collaborating with The Doors. Things couldn't possibly get groovier then on Adult Costume, that fuzz bass is a killer! It'll have you bobbing your head and tapping your feet involuntarily. Even on the opening The Fuck Face, you get a pretty fucking decent stoner tune with slow riff and all. The fuzz bass makes a welcome comeback on The Main Vein. Much noisier this time around, but no less interesting. With Jaybird and The Secret In Disguise, Complexion completes my holy trinity of SHOTM records. I let go of my vinyl edition once Very Friendly released this on CD.'",
            "credits": "released June 1, 2005\nComplexion - Manhand 15 / Spirit of Orr / Records / Very Friendly - 2005\nSunburned played an outdoor concert in a community garden in Somerville, Massachusetts in the summer of 2004. The show was recorded straight to mini-disc using a stereo mic. Sunburned Mike then edited it and here it is. The artist John Jagel lived in Somerville at the time and we got to go to his studio and choose the pieces for the artwork. This is a great record and a favorite of the band's. It was released first on vinyl in the USA and then cd in the UK. Currently out-of-print.\nRecorded At – Somerville Community Growing Center\nMastered At – Dream Authority Music\nArtwork – John Jagel (John also did artwork for Ornette Coleman's 'Ole\" and other Atlantic Releases in the 1960s)\nArtwork [Insert] – Romeros Bhatt\nLayout – Ron Schneiderman\nMastered By – John Stuart\nPerformer – Chad Cooper, David Bohill, John Moloney, MJK, Paul Labrecque, Rich Pontius, Robert Thomas, Ron Schneiderman, Tony Goddess & Valerie Webb\nRecorded By, Mixed By, Edited By – MjK*\nArtwork Photographed By – Don Harney",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection:\n\"FUCK YES! This record simply KICKS ASS! This is one and a half hours worth of the Sunburned clan at their improvising best. Most of the tracks found on Double Puberty (all live material) is on par with any of their earlier recordings like Jaybird or personal favorite The Secret In Disguise. If the opening track doesn't convince you of their genius, then this band is just not for you. There's a strong Sun Ra-vibe to some of these jams as clattering percussion and bizarre electronic fuckery surface through the muck. And how'bout them traumatizing vocal rants? You gotta love'em! Other tracks are heavy psych jams worthy of the most fucked up krautrock classics. Every piece here is great, but a personal favorite has to be the second track off of the second CD-R (\"Holy shit!\" are the only two words that come to mind). Too bad this was released as a cheap double CD-R (with horrible artwork), because this could easily have enjoyed a wider release.\"",
            "credits": "released June 1, 2006\nSunburned set sail across country on a one-way trip in May of 2006. I was staying in California after the tour to start the Howlin' Rain Tour and the rest of the band flew home. The crew was Dave Bohill, myself, Taylor Richardson, Ron Schneiderman & Keith Wood. We had a great time. Ron put together this double cdr with the intention of it being released as a double lp. Maybe that'll happen some day along with some track titles. I guess that makes this release a work in progress.I really love this one. -John Moloney 2016",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website\n'Interesting to note that an album like this, with such loud and clear references to american politics and culture, is actually a live recording from Finland (even the paper sleeve for the CD includes a crude drawing of the finnish flag, in stark contrast to the album's artwork). This album finds the sunburned bunch in deep fried, greasy rock'n'roll mode. Like a mutated cross between Motörhead and the Butthole Surfers, you can almost picture the band playing live in this sleazy highway truck stop brawl'n'grill to some toothless refrigerator-sized beardoes and wannabe cowboys. Of course, a Sunburned album wouldn't be a Sunburned album without it's fair share of pure, untamed weirdness and this can be heard on the crispy, lightly breaded Gateway Circle, the rich and buttery Rejected or the chocolaty goodness of Zorp (\"I'll have a Zorp please!\"). Finger licking good stuff as always. Grab a bucket of 20 before these are long gone!'",
            "credits": "released June 1, 2007\nEarth Do Eagles Do - Manhand 45 - 2007\nThis is an editied board recording from Sunburned's second time playing in Tampere, Finland at a show with Circle in the summer of 2006. Its the same day that Sunburned and Circle collaborated on a recording that became the Sunburned Circle LP. We were on tour and we were well-oiled. The amazing Mick Flower of Vibracathedral Orchestra was with us on playing lead guitar. A really nice trip...\ndrums, bass - Phil Franklin\nlead guitar - Michael Flower\nsax, electronics - MJK\ndrums, vocals - John Moloney\nlead guitar - Ron Schneiderman\nbass, vocals, keys - Robert Thomas\nMathieu references the cover being a political and cultural statement but the fact of the matter is that Moloney came up with the cover by cutting up and collaging a membership flyer from the now closed-down Eagle's Nest / Men's Club / Fraternal Order in Northampton first and then Rob made a great edit of that Tampere show and we just put the 2 pieces together.",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'I don't know how these guys do it, each studio or live release is nothing more than the band getting together and tirelessly improvising along the way, and yet every time, I can't seem to get tired of their unique brand of psychedelic sludge and stoner mayhem. There's always at least a few interesting elements on each release and Ego Enema is no exception. I'm not even sure if this is a live release or not, not much is mentioned on the cover and the sound quality on any Sunburned release is usually not a hint either. Except for the last track, this album (the last of 2008) finds the band in a particularly greased up, biker brawl tone. Each one is an extended jam which packs on the decibels and bpms at a frightening pace until the song eventually explodes or collapses under the weight and pressure. Only Ex Working Condition sounds more like an experimental ambient noise mess, much like a longer version of the material found on their Zample releases.'",

            "about": "The Estey Field Organ Tone Archive started with a $50 micro grant from the Brattleboro Museum & Art Center  (www.brattleboromuseum.org)  in 2013. One purpose was to build an audio catalog of Estey Field Organs that could serve as source material for others to use in connecting with sound waves.\nListening to the extended playing of a single chord, even an sonically difficult chord, creates a space where sounds build and tones collide. Resolution comes through the listener's own mind sorting out the wave patterns. Some use these recordings in their meditation, others use them for exploration into the fundamentals of sound travel. What will you find in them?\nFor deeper stories about the history of this technology, and the company that made them, stay tuned as more will be revealed. For now we bring you VOLUME ELEVEN in the series. This is the final chapter using this particular organ, as it has been passed to another set of hands [Pat Sansone of Wilco]. This is also the first installment to benefit from a more sophisticated recording device.\nFor earlier volumes of the ESTEY FIELD ORGAN TINE ARCHIVE please visit the bandcamp page at: https://esteyfieldorgantonearchive.bandcamp.com/\n- Ron Schneiderman Brattleboro, VT - June 2022\nThis is MH190.

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man - Exile on Broadway\nMH176 - Archival Release - Recorded October 29, 1999\nFor a brief period 22 years ago, Sunburned was banished from the Loft. We had nowhere to jam. We tried out a space in Everett but it was a very short-lived ratbox.\nWe ended up doing a few \"quiet\" sessions at my triple-decker apartment at 1277 Broadway, Somerville, Ma, shared by Naomi Dooge, Cousin Rich, and myself. Eventually, jamming at the apartment ended the night we went full-blizzard because Thela's Guy Treadgold was in town from NZ and drove the third floor neighbor out of his mind. Sometime after that we got let back into the Loft. The memory is very hazy on those times.\nFrom what I can hear on this tape, the music was played by Dave Bohill, Chad Cooper, Cousin Rich, Rob Thomas and myself. This was recorded live to cassette and never listened to until now.\nCover artwork by Rob Thomas.\nJohn Moloney\nNorthampton, MA - September 2021",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' Website:\n'Sunburned go back to their early tribal-folk-psych roots on this live recording. Many tracks sound like they could have been from some early Butthole Surfers record with plenty of grunting, nonsensical psychobabble and weird noises to reinforce the madness on display. Not quite as chaotic as the Zample series, there are tons of groovy licks here and there, but most of it will leave you baffled. The five part Yod makes up most of the album and even though these tracks are titled the same, each one is quite different from the other. Yod 1 for example sounds like early Sunburned circa Wildanimal while Yod 5 is a completely fried jam with bizarre cartoon samples over excerpts from Beethoven's Für Elise. For those of you who like their Sunburned with a hook, look no further than Zb/Ottowa, this monster live session comes at you with blazing fury and will put you in a trance with it's pounding drums and noisy excursions.'",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'At precisely twenty-five minutes in length, Outflow From Nucleus is one monster opening track, but fans of Sunburned (what ever happened to the hand?) at their heaviest will love it. The first third of the piece is structured around this incredible, repetitive bass-line riff while it's accompanied by washes of huge heavy psych jamming. The pattern then breaks apart and slows down as we crawl through zombie territory (feel free to create your own war analogies as this seems to be the theme of the recording) with deep rumbling sounds, moans and groans surrounding us. All of a sudden, a glimpse of hope, but the further we delve into the piece, the more aggressive things get as the last third of the piece falls practically in the Mainliner, louder-than-God category. This piece is followed by three much weirder (and shorter) tracks. All tracks are live (UK) so don't expect hi-fi here. I mean come on... how could you even expect that anymore!?'",

Hebden is going to turn this into some sort of electronic album! He'll just fuck up the whole Sunburned sound!\" Boy was I ever wrong! In fact, this is quite far from the remixed and reviewed album I was expecting; Kieren Hebden, even though he is the brains behind this particular album, acts more like a producer than the creator. The music is 100% Sunburned without a doubt and Hebden, who is a devout fan of the band, shows respect throughout. Imagine having a whole bunch of Sunburned's session recordings and being able to do whatever the fuck you want with them! A dream come true! Hebden obviously had tons of fun putting this all together and this rings through loud and clear on each track, from the noisier filler tracks like Captain Knowhere to the longer, pounding jams like the title track or The Wind Has Ears! Definitely some of Sunburned's best material yet!'",

            "about": "Ozone Layer - Formidable Circle\nManhand 29 - 2006\nIn loving memory of Marc Orleans, here is his self-produced and manufactured solo record for Manhand which was released in 2006.\nThis was a limited, numbered edition of 300 copies. A real cd in a card-stock gatefold cd jacket with pasted on art and an informational insert. Copies are still out there and available at Fusetron and on Discogs.\nThis is a FREE DOWNLOAD. We thought his should be up on the page for more people to hear this amazing album.\nIf you'd like to donate something in Marc's name please do so on Marc's sister Laura's suggestion at:\nTrout Unlimited - google it, we can't post links here.\n\"If you knew Marc, undoubtedly you knew about his passion for fly fishing. According to some, he had elevated the tying of flies to an art. He was a member of Trout Unlimited which works to conserve, protect and restore North America's coldwater fisheries and their watersheds.\"- Laura Orleans\nPlease read Byron Coley's words from the Wire about Marc:\n\"Byron Coley chronicles the life of prolific East Coast guitarist, lap steel player and chess freak Marc Orleans, of Sunburned Hand Of The Man, Spore and many more\nMarc Orleans departed the planet on 25 June 2020, leaving behind a vast circle of people he had touched in a myriad of ways. Marc was a very funny guy and a true oddball, as well as being a monster musician. Originally from Maine, he spent a few academic years in the Midwest, but most of his 53 years were spent in the upper portion of the East Coast, particularly Brooklyn, where he moved to (from Boston) in the second half of the 1990s.\nI had not seen Marc as much as I used to over the last few years. And that seems to have been the case with many of his old pals. His focus was intense, and during the past decade he started working seriously in the area of film production (doing both sound and camera crane operations). His musical interests had also shifted away from rock based sounds and more towards playing mandolin in the bluegrass tradition. But as I contacted various people whose arcs had collided with Marc's over the years, one thing became apparent – he was involved in more different musical ensembles and projects than just about anyone I can name.\nProbably the largest chunk of the musical sub-underground knew Marc best from his decade-long tenure with the Massachusetts freak collective Sunburned Hand Of The Man. From 1997–2007 (and sporadically afterwards), he was one of Sunburned's primary members, lending his searing Gibson Firebird tone to many recordings and shows. Asked about their first meeting, Sunburned’s Rob Thomas recalled Marc as being among the very few people who actually enjoyed a show Sunburned's precursor band Shit Spangled Banner played opening for The Dirty Three (then on their debut US tour). Marc approached Rob after the set for congratulatory purposes, and the seeds for Sunburned were sown. Jams at Thomas and John Moloney's Charlestown loft were interspersed with sessions in Marc's Allston basement (where he also kept his Moog synthesizer). The original version of Sunburned consisted (at least technically) of Thomas, Moloney, Orleans, Rich Pontius, Conrad Capistran, Brian Donnelly, James Coleman and Chad Cooper. And those guys remained its core for a good long while, no matter how many other folks passed through the ranks.\nDuring the years he was most active with Sunburned, Marc formed a trio called Fall In Love with Kyp Malone (TV On The Radio) and Kevin Shea, who played loudly and sporadically around Brooklyn for several years. He worked extensively in the experimental beard rock trio Enos Slaughter, with Dave Shuford (No Neck Blues Band) and Carter Thornton (Izititiz). He performed and recorded solo as Ozone Layer (documented on a Manhand label CD called Formidable Circle) as well as under his own name (documented on a gorgeous 8\" lathe of American primitive guitar on the Moran Tape Label). Marc was also in the final version of GHQ (with Marcia Bassett, Pete Nolan and sometimes Steve Gunn), and worked with Matthew Bower in the NY iteration of Sunroof!. He also had a duo with Mick Flower (Vibracathedral Orchestra) called OF. But he was most omnipresent with Sunburned, who played far and wide, stunning the punters with their reckless abandon. Near the centre of Sunburned's vortex was Marc's enormous riffing on his trusty Firebird (and later, lap steel or dobro). Rob reports he had abandoned playing the Moog after just a few gigs.\nBesides his many musical activities during this period, Marc was a madman for street hockey. No Neck Blues Band’s Keith Connolly recalls, “He’d delight in graphically recounting cross-checks given and received, a testament to his scrappy nature.” When he gave up hockey, Marc became an avid chess player.\n“I remember when we were on tour with Comets On Fire,” says Moloney, “Marc would always be playing serious games with (bassist) Ben Flashman. They'd be getting out their strategy books and all that. He peaked with that around 2004, 2005.”\n“Then he stopped for a while. He had to,” adds Thomas. “He was really getting obsessed with the game. I don't think he felt it was good for him anymore. But that's what he was like. Whatever he was interested in he would just focus on to the exclusion of everything else.”\nAt a Six Organs Of Admittance show at Free 103 in New York City circa 2003: (from left) Marc, David Keenan, Steve Gunn (background), Heather Leigh Murray, John Moloney, Brooke Sietinsons, Meg Baird. Photo courtesy of Sunburned Hand Of The Man\nPrior to Sunburned, Marc had been in a loud, punky quartet called Spore, who made three albums in 1993–94, and managed to get one of Marc’s tunes onto the soundtrack of Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers. Following this were a few loud, strange units of intense obscurity: Ambulance Driver, Pinball and Electric Bunnyhole, and a stretch concentrating on work with a great German influenced post-rock trio called Juneau, who released two exceptional albums, without causing much of a stir outside of Boston. Which set the stage for Sunburned.\nMarc moved down to NYC around the time Sunburned coalesced and was a well-known figure around Brooklyn, despite the fact his main gig was in Boston. Of particular interest was a Brooklyn band he had called Eschaton, who were supposedly a very nuts space/improv unit but appear to have been witnessed solely by Thurston Moore, Chris Corsano and Keith Connolly. Other combos of this era include Ozone Swimmers (with his then wife Ela Orleans). This duo became the 3i's when Pete Nolan joined. Other units from the period include This Trouble, a trio led by Suntanama’s Darren ‘Catfish’ Zoltowski, with cellist Kirsten McCord, who recorded a still unissued single. There was also a quartet called Knot The Bottle with Connolly, Phil Franklin (Sunburned) and Wednesday Knudsen (Pigeons) After he stopped being a regular member of Sunburned, Marc still played occasional gigs with them (the last was in 2014), but his main interests were elsewhere.\nDave Shuford was starting a new, overtly country rock band called D Charles Speer & The Helix. Jason Meagher (No Neck) played bass, Robert ‘Moose’ Gregory (Suntanama) did percussion, Hans Chew (a Tennessee ex-pat also involved with the Helix's brother band Coachfingers) played piano, and Marc played lap steel, electric and resonator guitar. This led Marc into investigating the pedal steel, which he played with Meg Baird, among others. Following his appearance on Steve Gunn's Boerum Palace LP, he also formed the quartet Orleans Gunn with Steve and a rotating cast of characters. Moloney declares, “The Orleans Gunn band show at Zebulon was one of the best concerts I ever saw in NYC.” After that he turned his attention to mandolin and bluegrass, both of which he pursued avidly after being encouraged in his pursuits by the late Jack Rose (with whom The Helix toured), Marc was also involved with Brooklyn avant-country outfit Trummors. And he formed a new band with Tom Carter called Eleven Twenty Nine. Initially a duo, Eleven Twenty Nine became a trio with the addition of drummer Michael Evans of God Is My Co-Pilot.\n“Eleven Twenty Nine was built around our guitar interplay,” Carter writes. “I was heavily into West Coast stuff at that time and it shows, which counterbalanced Marc's manic energy (can't remember who said, 'playing with Marc was like grappling with lightning', but that was accurate and it led to exhaustion for most people).”\nEventually, Marc started working primarily with members of NYC's bluegrass scene. This led to him forming The Gotham City Pickers with guitarist JP Gilbert and fiddler Bruno Bruzzese.\nMarc's other non-musical passions included fly fishing. And as with anything that captured his interest, he went all-in. He tied flies, soaked up the literature and travelled all over the place to stand in the water and cast. He also returned to some aspects of his visual art. Marc had studied painting at the Chicago Institute of Arts and Antioch College, although friends more easily remember his meticulous work with Polaroids. But his main focus remained music: playing it, listening to it, talking about it... Marc was nothing if not persistent in his passions.\nAnd he was a real good guy, absolutely true to who he was. And he will be missed.\" Byron Coley - Deerfield, MA - 2020",

It takes a full ten minutes of random noises and fucked up rants before any discernable beats come in. But even then, things don't get much more coherent. My first impressions were that Fuckethead is Sunburned's attempt at a Godspeed You! Black Emperor-like monster progressive tune. But of course, in the hands of Sunburned, you're lucky if you get a few seconds of actual melody. Musical madness at it's most brutish form, Fuckethead will leave few heads unturned. Even fans might do a double take before catching on. Gotta love it! As with Glik, the CD-R is housed in a single plastic shell you find in dollar stores.'",
            "credits": "released March 1, 2008\nFuckethead - Manhand 76 - 2008\ninternet quote: 'an amazing free-punk, noise-psych exorcism that leaves little room for reprieve. Frightening stuff for sure, and despite the blown fidelity, an apt recording of Sunburned at the top of their talents.'\nSunburned - Recored live at Death By Audio, Brooklyn, NY in September 2007. Psycho-squad lead by the late Adam Nodelman in full freaky tweaky for a death by chicken audience. This was only released in a cdr edition of 36.",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man\nGet Wet With The Animal\nMH 156\nWinter 2018 was long, cold and rough in Western Massachusetts so we turned our practice space into a Wednesday-Night Guantanamo. Other bands would see us roll up in the van and get visibly bummed that their rehearsals were about to be annihilated. One guy even asked one of our members if we could turn down the \"low end\" which most likely meant the 2 hours of screaming about the DMT ANIMAL, because there was no bass guitar that night... There was a story going around the net that day stating that Johns Hopkins University was conducting a study and wanted to meet with anyone who had seen the DMT creature or alien. It made for an intriguing subject.\nGet Wet With The Animal was recorded entirely at our practice space in Easthampton, MA. These Holy Grail fueled recordings are a mix of iphone and zoom recordings run through garageband, reaper and some plug-ins. We're still working on the much more listener-friendly Black Dirt session but its taking too long so in the meantime here's this. Enjoy.\nArtwork by Greta Svalberg. Hand logo by Phil Franklin. Edited by John Moloney and some mastering done by Jeremy Pisani.\nThe cop on the cover is Boston's former police commisioner William T. Evans, who has the most immaculate Boston accent, check it out, and very well may be the Alien himself.\nScott Allison - electronics\nJen Gelineau - violin\nShannon Ketch - synth\nPaul Labrecque - guitar\nTed Lee - drums, electronics, vocals\nJohn Moloney - drums, vocals\nJeremy Pisani - guitar\nRon Schneiderman - guitar\nRob Thomas - bass",

            "about": "Sunburned - Glak - MH85\nThis is a closet find 'reissue' of a CDr release from around 2007 or 2008 that slipped through the cracks when I was archiving everything around 2020.\nThis feels to me like a companion or epilogue to our \"Spacial Crime Symbol\" release from around the same time - 2007 & 2008. I hear some Europe & USA tour action (probably Ithaca College 2007), basement tapes & black-hole electrojams, 2 post-punk jangle tracks from Mick Flower's house, a Moloney & Thomas chug jam from the \"Weekend at Burnie's 2\" session, mixed with some of Rob's spoken word experimements that were on the samplers at the time.\nI have no notes on these tracks but they were played by John Moloney / Paul Labrecque / Ron Schneiderman / MJK / Robert Thomas / Taylor Richardson / Sarah O'Shea / maybe others\nfrom Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection\" website:\n'Not sure if Glak is meant to be some sort of ode to drugs, but the opening track would have me believe so as we are given a glimpse into a casual conversation on the subject. Not only that, but most of the music that follows has that early solo John Frusciante, junky vibe to it (was Glak released to finance a drug habit as well?). Warped and bleak visions of blues, abstract vocal/noise snippets and lethargic attempts at standard rock and metal are all brought to you in a not-so-neat little package which will mostly confuse, but perhaps also amuse. The album's rock-oriented material reminds me of what Mahogany Brain might sound like were they to cover some of Gong's work (I can definitely hear some vocal similarities with Daevid Allen as well). If you enjoy Sunburned in their \"anything goes\" mode, you'll love Glak. CD-R comes in a slim DVD case with a printed insert.'\nCover art made in Leeds, England by Tom Greenwood, Ron Schneiderman, & John Moloney.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's My Record Collection' website:\n'Sunburned continue their series of \"G\" albums with this sonic oddity. Most of the five tracks on Glek are like minimalist electronic exercises; something along the lines of Perry & Kingsley could they have recorded something over fifteen thousand years ago. Synthesizers dominate throughout the album with only a few tunes using a steady drum beat for the listener to rely on. It takes a while for Krik to lift off, but once it does (about midway through), the rest of the album goes by in a flash! Piling on the strange melodies, drones and various noises for a curiously entertaining listen. Meltmen has this twisted, early Residents vibe going for it while Triangle-9 finds the jazzy elements of earlier installments bubbling up from within the muck. Some other tracks, like Bremburn, remind me of Excepter during one of their more disoriented jams (and without any vocals). Glek is for those of you who like the collective at their strangest only!'",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Have you ever wondered what Klaus Schulze and Tangerine Dream would sound like if they were to start a band today (and were taking much more experimental drugs)? I'm sure it would sound something like Glik. Filled with bizarre synthesizer noises and fucked up drones sprinkled over a primitive beat, this is like electronic music for children born with anencephaly. Some of these tracks sound like the wilder moments on any given Sun Ra record (and is often just as insane). Just check out the free-jazz mammoth that is Tonecocker - a one-of-a-kind highlight in the band's discography. At nearly thirty-five minutes in length, it never dulls down for a second as new sounds and ideas reach our ears every few seconds. Trinsing The Atom is another highlight. A sixteen minutes excursion into all-out freak'n'roll territory. The last five minutes will literally fry your brain. The CD-R comes in a plastic single shell and is limited to only fifty copies, my copy being numero uno!'",

            "about": "From Matieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'The last installment in Sunburned's \"G\" series is even more fucked up than any of it's sister releases. Again, electronic instruments feature abundantly, like Klaus Schultze after a night of binge drinking, but it isn't rare for the band to suddenly shift towards heavier and freer territory. Although every track is meant to blend in seamlessly with each other, as if the album were one long track, there so much change going on here that Glok could easily have been divided up into hundreds of different tracks. One of the coolest moments on the album is the sudden blast of Black Sabbath/Melvins-like fury on the second track (all are untitled). The seventh track is also quite amazing with it's Add N To (X) on valium quality. This track is (of course) followed by a skeletal, upbeat no wave pop tune with Mrs. Kerry, the local church lady on the casio organ. Weird and unpredictable Sunburned schisms which will definitely please the fans.'",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Surprisingly enough, Gluk sounds nothing like any of it's sister releases (Glik & Glak). Is it any wonder why they chose to redo the cover to When The Shit Hits The Jazz? Most of the work has one foot squarely planted in the whole free jazz scene. The whole album could easily pass off as this long lost recording by Sun Ra & His Arkestra. You know those twisted home recordings where one could hear the phone in the background? I'm not used to Sunburned sounding so clearly planted in one sound throughout a record. Gluk includes everything you might expect from an old free jazz skronk fest: hyper active percussion, the occasional outburst of brass instruments like an angry dog, a chiming bell here and there or trickling piano notes to sooth the soul, tribal chanting and long passages of almost complete silence. Don't know if the band released this just to show they could actually pull it off, but the results are quite interesting and different.'",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand Of The Man - HAZ\nLoft Tapes Volume 3 - MH93\nMusic recorded at the Sunburned Loft, 7 Sherman Street, Charlestown, MA, date unknown. Artwork by Sarah O'Shea. Released in 2008 on cassette in an edition of 50. Players were probably Rob Thomas, Rich Thomas, Brian Donnelly, John Moloney, Rich Pontuis, & Chad Cooper.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n'Sunburned Hand Of The Man continue their series of \"loft tapes\" which they started earlier this year with the quadruple tape release of Bootcamp: Moses. These are basically compilations of early material which wouldn't really fit on any album and they run the gammut from the weird to the extremely weird. For example, the first two tracks on this second volume range from a sped up version, chipmunk voices and all, of a wild gypsy folk song played by the camp fire to a sped up version of a bizarre traditional chinese folk song. It's INSANE!!! I don't know what's up with the high-pitched voices; maybe it's an early stylistic approach, maybe it's a fuck up. Whatever it is, it gives these tunes a truly creepy and deranged vibe that I had never heard from them before. Freaky late night shroom jams? Entranced incantations for lost souls? Lamentations for unknown anthropomorphic gods? The aural equivalent of salvia divinorum?'",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man - Het Bos\nLive / Burn: Volume 14 - Antwerp, Belgium\nMarch 22, 2022 - MH206\nShannon Ketch - Vocals, Synth, Sampler\nJohn Moloney - Drums, Vocals, Mellotron, Harmonica\nMark Perretta - Guitar, Vocals, Tapes, Harmonica\nRob Thomas - Bass (overdubbed 01/28/2024 at The Sunspot)\nMix, edits and artwork by John Moloney. The front and back photos are from the bathroom at Het Bos - which translates into english means, \"The Forest.\"\nThis was one of the five shows we played on our March 2022 tour of London, Leeds, Amsterdam & Antwerp. For this show we showed up on the train from London as a trio of Mark, Shannon & myself. After the bigger band blowouts of London & Leeds, we were faced with the question of \"What the hell are we going to do?\" or \"How is this going to work?\" This is how it went. Het Bos is a beautiful and welcoming space and made it very easy for us to relax and let the music flow.\nAntwerp has been very kind to Sunburned and is like a second home for us. Our old friend, Koen Vandenhoudt surprised us by being the house DJ for the night. Our booking agent Vincent Royers was there as well as a few familiar faces and some online supporters. Dennis Tyfus couldn't make it because he caught covid the week before, but it was very cool to see his old sign from the Scheldhapen hanging in the club. Koen was the first person to take the chance of bringing Sunburned to Continental Europe in 2003 by having us come to Belgie in Hasselt. Sunburned's Paul Labrecque lived in Antwerp for a while too. A lot of wet and crazed nights were had in that town.\nHet Bos had the best backline for us to use and we projected some video behind us, while the set was recorded through the board. Pruulip opened the show and were great. Thanks for listening. Enjoy - JM 2024.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"It took me five years to finally get a copy of this 7\". Not having a turntable back then, vinyl releases became less of a priority for me and 7\"s actually felt like a waste of time. But of course, I wouldn't be a Sunburned completist if I didn't include this one now would I? So after a fucked up transaction through Ecstatic Yod, I asked for a copy. As was expected, there's some pretty nifty Sunburned music on it. A-side's Hoof Trip would make a great alternate soundtrack to Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo (imagine this track during the emperor's dressing ritual scene!); clattering percussion, weird buzzing analog synths (I think) and wind chimes make this one a very hippy-like experience. Plague Pipe, on the other hand, sounds like some pretty standard early Sunburned material. It's as good as anything that made me fall in love with the band in the first place, but their sound would soon expand to new horizons and it was time to move along.\"",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Idgey Bath is a pretty strange record, even by Sunburned's standards. If I understand correctly, each track is a unique effort (or solo composition) from each member of the band. Moloney is responsible for Glass Galaxy, a solo synthesizer track with a sawtooth wave pulsating and droning away, taking our ears hostage for the duration of the track. Ubugoo on the other hand is a disjointed psychedelic noise freak out by (or led by) Sarah O'Shea with tons of itchy sounds, arbitrary guitar notes and Casio keyboard madness. Michael Flower is behind the album's unfortunately titled piece de resistance Pizza. At over twenty minutes in length, it's a pretty dreamy and hypnotic jam which could very well be the bastardized mutant offspring of a dream date with Pekka Airaksinen and Bruce Haack. Perhaps I'm wrong and I've misinterpreted the barely legible liner notes, but each track is so radically different that they all feel like unique compositions.'",

Recorded shortly before the disastrous election of 2016, it is partially filled with the darkness, paranoia and creeping dread that filled that time period. But there is also a hefty amount of the druggy, electronic ecstasis for which the duo is known (no matter their handle.)... Keyboards, strings, tubs, puckeroos, voices…all of these things were recorded in unexpected ways and places (via computers, handhelds, etc.) then welded together like pennies found inside a stack of rare private press LPs Paul Majors stole from a dollar bin in Kentucky.\" - Byron Coley",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand Of The Man with Bill Nace\nIrrational Body Poem In Real Time - MH 81\nOriginally released in 2008 on cassette in a forgotten small amount. Artwork by Rob Thomas.\nI remember we were on tour to SXSW with Bill Nace who was supposed to play his own set this night. The drive from Memphis was so long that we showed up to the (weird) gig at Rubber Gloves with Why? & Cryptacize in Denton, Texas, right before we we were supposed to play so Bill's set got bumped and we just decided to play together. This is the sound of 10 hour van ride-rage squeezed into a 15 minute set.\nPlayed by John Moloney, Bill Nace, Sarah O'Shea, Rob Thomas & Ron Schneiderman.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n\"This short, cassette-only release by the Sunburned clan starts off sounding like a torture ceremony involving R2-D2 of Star Wars fame and some three-hundred pound dominatrix. Barely audible (and much less recognizable) background noise, feedback and tumbling drums (you can forget about any semblance of rhythm here except for the occasional chugging sound) are accompanied by a series of loud, high pitched bleeps and electronic slide whistles. All of this escalates into a frenzy of harsh industrial noise. It all ends abruptly on side one... only to continue blasting away at our eardrums on the second side. Things get even uglier here as the sound becomes more and more piercing as the tune \"progresses\". Thank GOD the whole thing lasts less than fifteen minutes long. Dogs have gathered on the front porch! Any longer and they would have gone Night Of The Living Dead on me! For fans of Sunburned at their noisiest ONLY!\"",

Featherweight really lays down the mood of the album, it's combination of seventies styled keyboard jamming, flute and reverb soaked screams and yelps relaxing your muscles and taking over the part of your brain which makes you bob your head to the beat. The title track then takes advantage of the fact that you are vulnerable and lifts you up into space, making you expand, heavy and light at the same time, your mind floating among the galaxies. The bassline on this track is to die for it's so fucking amazing; and when the drums get louder and the vocals weirder as it goes along, there just ain't no turning back. The rest of the record follows the same guidelines. If you only had one record to get by this band...",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of The Man\nLive / Burn 13 - Penryn, Cornwall, England\n06/10/2008 - MH 205\nThis is an amazing board recording recovered from a thought-to-be-fried hard-drive. The show was at Miss Peapod's in Penryn, Cornwall, England.\nThe legendary Chris Grey who recorded L.Voag and The Homosexuals was working front of house this night and captured this very high fidelity recording of an especially inspired, Cornish Pasty & Fish & Chips fueled Sunburned crew. Dave Morris who went on to front Red River Dialect hosted us at his house the night before the show and we had an amazing time in Penryn.\nThis was our second time at Miss Peapod's on a UK & Ireland tour booked by our buddy Chiz at Qujunktions.\nPlayers on this recording are Paul Labrecque, John Moloney, Sarah O' Shea, Robert Thomas & Ron Schneiderman. Photos, edits & artwork by John Moloney. Sunburned logo by Phil Franklin.",

            "about": "This is a recently unearthed tour recording by MJK. The show was at Les Instants Chavirés, Paris in 2004. We were on tour with No Neck Blues Band, this was the last show of the run.\nWe were trying to 'out psych' each other every night and we'd alternate who played first. Both camps had a healthy competition vibe going on (classic Boston / NY - Sox / Yankees vibes, seemed that way to me anyway). So on that tour, whoever went on second totally blew out whoever went on first. Both groups were so inspired by each other and I cant wait to get around to transferring the videos from this tour.\nThese were some of the best shows both groups have ever been involved in. In Paris, Sunburned went on before NNCK, and then they went and cracked the space/time continuum with one of the most insanely amazing shows i've ever seen to this day. - John Moloney, Northampton, MA 2019",

            "about": "Live Burn 6: London, England 2004 & 2006\n93 Feet East, Brick Lane, May 31, 2004:\nThis was the first show of our May / June European Tour in 2004. We just come off a crazed US tour with Fourtet a month earlier, and a few months before that we did our first and very well-recieved tour of the UK after the big Wire article. Vibracathedral Orchesta & Jack Rose were also on the bill.\nThe show was wild and very LOOSE with just about all of VCO joining the Sunburned set. We've definately played better shows but this was an amazing night where we met new friends and legends like Edwin Pouncy and Pete Coward.\nThese were the days when we'd roll 3-4 vehicles deep to shows and fly 8-12 of us to Europe with plane ticklets fronted with my bartending money. We were new to this: we'd check in combo amps as a 'suitcase' by cutting a slit in a cardboard box so the amp handle would stick through and then watch it get manhandled by baggage handlers, Nothing broke! Traynor makes good combo amps... The days when we'd gather around and enjoy Chris Corsano's unveiling of an entire (sawed-in-half) drum kit that fit into a regular suitcase, Nights before flights preparing all the suitcases like Rambo. The days when we'd remember to pack a full-size pig megaphone for reasons now not remembered, and sell cartons Amercian cigs at the European merch tables because we saw that cigs were so expensive over there. They were a Hot Item! These were the fun days of cameras before smartphones took over our brains and negatively effected a good portion of our society...\nThe defunct music mag \"Loose Lips Sink Ships\" sent out Andrew Male to write up the show with the amazing photographer Steve Gullick, look them up... Andrew wrote the best description of this night and of Sunburned or really any band/ gig that I've ever read.\n\"Tramping the plastic glass underfoot, this whisperer on the right moved up close behind, hung on, swallowed, pressed into motion, cold glass against the arm, hissing through teeth, cursed the band... Coming out of the speaker, not drum / guitar shop music, but asthma wheezing, the dull thumping of horses, of bees packed and buzzing in the chest, against some comforting, somnambulant schizophrenia of sound, brain tuning in and out, ghostly voices that bear no resemblance to the viewed act, a rattlesnake caught in an iron foundry, monks on downers, all groans, eight or twelve members, Critter, Chad Cooper, Cousin Rich Thomas, Phil Franklin, Reverend John Moloney, others[*] - in a circle beating out chain-gang rhythms, led by the rhythmic bass of aged schoolboy Rob Thomas, in the centre of a stage that looks like the aftermath battle scene of some '68 hippie riot, protestors trapped in the dying control centre slowly picking up their daft instruments of wood and metal and wires, an indefinable band formed from band members in Franklin's Mint, Fisherman's Faggot[*], Shit Yourself, Faxed Head, Ghetto Breakers, a band born in 1997 from something called Shit-Spangled Banner, some abstract psychedelic free trip with frowns and roots in Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac and Cream, Funkadelic and Ash Ra Tempel, Sly and Sun Ra but made out in the dark woods by the demons and LSD... and then it starts to change, kick in, guitar, rhythm, removed from everyday reality, some sick marriage of those two Sawyer families of American myth - Mark Twain's ragged-trousered truant leading Texas Chainsaw Massacre's pallid, flesh-hungry family up from the rusty iron winter depths of their stuckboard kill-pit and into the sun, some ragged drum bugle corps reborn as artistic community, a missing mountain family sleeping with a car full of tapes, the children of John Fahey turning their dark and violent desires into a mystic broadcast on the King Biscuit Flour Hour, incomprehensible transmissions of hypnotic Native American chant and chime, a backs-of-envelope Rime Of The Ancient Mariner for a damned rat-pack brotherhood trying every combination of blast, chime, clank, slam, scream, thunk and mental-institution shout-in-the-dark in the hope that, one day, they'll maybe play the right combination of notes and all will be well and they'll eventually find their new exotic world, of white sand and bright light.\nFive six years ago when everything seemed healthy, and the ultimate edge of the avant-garde was guys on lap-tops making cerebral dance music you couldn't dance to, this family didn't realise what was happening. Now this family are happier because George Bush allows people to say, \"Well governments are evil, they don't even care...\" This band don't even know if kids in their twenties have any idea of what happened in the sixties but maybe that's better because they'll regard that as a failure, how revolution how got co-opted so just showing someone that something can exist, that isn't pre-packaged, that they're doing something deliberately different, will help. Tonight this isn't their CDR, Mind Of A Brother from 1997, that made speakers sound like they were powered by twigs, bird-spit, and fear, but the sound you come upon in a clearing. Some people think that anyone can just get up there like those fucking jam bands for tourist scum out in New Orleans, but this is music for moving, a band elevated to a state of hyperactivity-in-public trying to inspire one guy, one woman, anyone, a band who've been around for a long time until they were sure they developed something really unique. Jackie O'Motherfucker? The No Neck Blues Band? No, Sunburned Hand Of The Man, No-one else sounds like them. It's a heavy sound, the kind of sound that leaks across floors into eager and absent mind, filling hair and clothes and mouths. The two girls smile and walk up. Did you like this, they ask. We thought it was the worst band we've ever seen, isn't that right? And she was laughing. Laughing hard. But, you know, in a good way.\" - Andrew Male - 2004\n\"If everyone liked what we were doing 'd know we were doing something terribly wrong. If Sunburned Hand of the Man rprotests anything it's reality itself. What people consider to be reality is not what reality is. It's protest against what's happening every day. We're trying to slip something under the curtain.\" Rob Thomas 2004\n*Wikipediaen.wikipedia.org  › wiki › Faggot_(food)\nFaggots are meatballs made from minced off-cuts and offal, especially pork (traditionally pig's heart, liver, and fatty belly meat or bacon) together with herbs for flavouring and sometimes added bread crumbs. It is a traditional dish in the United Kingdom, especially South and Mid Wales and the English Midlands.]\n*93 Feet East was played by Michael Josef K, David Bohill, John Moloney Ron Schneiderman, Robert Thomas, Paul Labrecque, and Valerie Webb with everyone from Vibracathedral Orchestra joining in.\nCorsica Studios, Elephant & Castle, Sunday August 27, 2006:\nWe played here twice in 2006, this is the second time. We loved this space and both times we played there were packed.\nThis audio which has some issues comes from the video camera that Sarah O'Shea used to film the show. A highlight reel of this video can be watched at the No Mask Required facebook event page.\nPlayers at this show were: Mick Flower, Phil Franklin, Bridget Hayden, Michael Josef K, John Moloney, Rob Thomas, Ron Schneiderman, Keith Wood and Tom Kirton, our friend from Wales whos now the mayor of a small town there, who was supposed to do sound that night but bailed and joined us on stage.\nOriginal Photo by Steve Gallick, logo by Phil Franklin, design / layout by Sarah Gibbons & John Moloney.",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website\n'A second tour only CD-R which was released at the same time as Knifelife. The music here is more disturbing and gloomy, sometimes bordering on drone. The cover art was apparently taken in part from drawings by a homeless person and the overall feeling of the record is that of despair. It's so primitive and bare and actually sounds like it could have been created by a bunch of hairy bums who were jamming with found instruments. It certainly doesn't make any sense on a whole (not that that was ever a pre-requisite for SHOTM releases!). The perfect soundtrack to shooting up or smoking crack cocaine if there ever was one. You'll probably want to take a shower after listing to it. The last track, Drizzled reminded me a bit of a track by the Butthole Surfers entitled Jimi. It certainly conjures up the same disturbing atmosphere.'",

            "about": "Sunburned hand of the Man - London Zero\nMH89 / Three Lobed Recordings 065\nOriginally released as a bonus cd that came with the Three Lobed double LP titled \"A Grand Tour of Tunisia.\"\nThis cd captures 2 wild performances by Sunburned in London in 2008. The first half is from our London ICA show where we did a multimedia performance art piece with a video wall and live sculpture. We really loved this performance and to me, it stands out as the peak of what we were doing around 2008. (JM)\nThe second performance was us opening up for Fourtet / Burial and a few others. We were invited by Kieran (fourtet) to participate in this massive show at the 02 arena (where Led Zep just had their final show). They flew us over for one show. We played the show and then spent the week up at Mick's in Leeds just recording and hanging around the kitchen table.",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website\n\"What is there to say about an album which starts with a track like The Overt Statuette, an exercise in strangeness, there's no beat or melody in sight, just bizarre, unidentifiable noises. Very unusual when compared to the psychedelic jams we're used to, but that's just proof that the Sunburned collective are an unpredictable bunch, always trying to break new ground. It's funny to hear a group like NNCK trying to sound exactly like this on their later releases, knowing full well that Sunburned Man Of The Hand were doing these same sounds a few years before. Electronic sounds have taken a bigger role on this record which finds the collective leaning more towards the weirder side of their sound. The eighteen-minute-long The Soft Hustle is an interesting bit of hysteria as crazed female screams mix with distorted yelps, electro-buzzes and in-the-red drum beats (those hi-hats'll drive you mad).",

            "about": "This is Sunburned's first release. We released this as a cdr in an edition of 50 in jewel cases as something to have on the merch table for our tour with No Neck Blues Band and John Fahey in the late 90s. It was reissued as a Manahand cdr and then as an LP on Feeding Tube Records in 2015.\nfrom Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"Mind Of A Brother, like many of the group's earlier efforts, really shows off their psychedelic side. Strange sounds and reverb abound on the title track. This first track progresses at a very slow pace, but new layers of sound come and go as it moves along; the addition of the harmonica is a really nice touch. Dearly Departed is much more hectic with a wild fuzz guitar with flanger at full effect, but the slow washes of drones in the background create a nice contrast. The next three tracks are longer psychedelic jams and they sound like something Sun Ra could have conjured up during his more \"out there\" period, very jazzy (you got to love the clarinet on Brother Of All and the bird calls on Loveletter To Complicated Dreams!). The group were to considerably lower the psychedelic touches on later albums and turn them into all out weirdness. It still sounds fresh here, making this a great first effort!\"\nByron Coley says:\n\"\"Amazing archival retrieval (with extra material on the download) of the first release by long-running human zoo known as Sunburned. Forged in the heat of Kristin Anderson's Charlestown loft, the group more or less descended straight from the corpse of Shit Spangled Banner, although they did not assume the band name until 1997 (two years after the first protean jams had started). The material on the album was recorded in 1997 & '98, often deep in the grip of acid flashes, and it really shows. Over the course of their nearly two-decade lifetime, Sunburned has been many things, but it's easy to forget how spacily jazzoid and proggily psyched-out their initial gushes were. The music here is wildly explorative and crazily inventive, sharing a clear affinity with fellow travelers No Neck Blues Band. Indeed, the second edition of the CDR of this album was created to be sold on a 1999 tour which was No Neck, John Fahey, and Sunburned. One can only shudder at the mere thought. Anyway, this may well be one of the best Sunburned albums. It has a bizarre sweetness I never noticed in the band back then, because they always seemed like thugs underneath everything else. But you can really sense it here. And Rob Thomas's excellent liner notes attest to the benign flow of their early visions. How nice to hear where this weird trip started.\" --Byron Coley, 2015",
            "credits": "released January 1, 1998\nLiner Notes by Rob Thomas\nMind of a Brother:\nThis LP was entirely recorded in a converted warehouse loft studio at 7 Sherman Street in Charlestown, Massachusetts. The building was shaped rather like a ship, set just off Mystic Ave and, at the time, was surrounded by a junkyard filled with wrecked automobiles & decommissioned subway trolleys. The space was initiated and built out by Kristin Anderson & Phil Franklin as an art & screen printing studio/living space circa 1989. The building itself is known by some as \"The Coffin Factory\" - I have been told that it was built in the 19th century to manufacture coffins for the civil war dead, and was rumored to have been owned by the Wilkes family of (John Wilkes Booth infamy). I began to research these allegations and quickly grew bored, so I will leave them for you to corroborate if you desire. Kristin continued to operate the space after Phil's departure to San Francisco in the early 90's (where he became involved in Caroliner Rainbow among many other pursuits) and she designed & screened covers for several lovely LP & single sleeves (Michael Hurley's - National Weed Growers Association 7\"; Matthew Bower & Richard Youngs –Site/Realm LP ; The No-Neck Blues Band – Hoichi LP and many more…). She began her own Poon Village label around 1993 and released a series of beautifully packaged, hand screened LPs & CDs including \"Live at C.O.N. Artists\" by Sun City Girls, which was recorded in concert at the 7 Sherman St space.\nSunburned Hand of the Man began informally out of improvised sessions that John Moloney and myself held at 7 Sherman St in 1996 after the implosion of our trio (with Rich Pontius), \"The Shit Spangled Banner\" earlier that year. Kristin had kindly let the SSB rehearse and record on various occasions in '94 & I moved into the loft in February of '95. Moloney moved in shortly after. My cousin Richard Thomas, Marc Orleans, Chad Cooper, James Coleman, Brian Donnelly and finally Rich Pontius all became involved in the increasingly regular and extended improvised sessions and Cousin Rich, Chad and James would also move into the loft at various points.\nIn '97 we decided to call the group Sunburned Hand of the Man when it emerged from a stream of consciousness rant of mine. I wanted to include a tribute to the psychedelic Welsh band Man in our title, as I was obsessed with the group's early albums at the time. (Our original group name had been \"Save Yourself\" in tribute to the majestic Welsh group Help Yourself … one track appears under that name on one of the several “Live at RRRecords” cd-r compilations Ron Lessard issued circa 1997). While I attempted to pay titular homage to the Ballroom inspired, acid rock kingpins of Wales, the early Sunburned music was infinitely less sophisticated, but no less lysergically informed. Certain printing projects had been partially compensated for with a steady supply of clean, powerful LSD which filtered thru much of the group psyche, opening ears and minds to the possibilities of what a musical group could actually be in its wake. “Mind of a Brother” was the first example of these possibilities we chose to share with the world.\nSide one (also tracks 1,2,3 & 5 on the original cd-r and download) were recorded in the summer of '97. Side two \"Loveletter to Complicated Dreams\" was recorded on April 19th 1998 as an excerpt from our performance at a free afternoon concert we held at 7 Sherman St along with No-Neck Blues Band and Egypt is the Magick #. The NNCK set was issued in its entirety as disc one of the \"Birth of Both Worlds\" 2xcd (Sound@one 46,47). A beautiful video of this performance was shot by Cousin Rich and has recently been unearthed; I hope it will be made available to the public soon. The impetus for this particular concert was to provide a space for the annual performance NNCK held on Orthodox Easter, which for reasons I can't recall, was unable to be held in NYC that year. This was perhaps the fifth in that series of annual concerts, all of which previously (and subsequently) were held on rooftops in Manhattan. A few years ago, NNCK published their entire back catalog digitally and invited different friends and acquaintances of the group to share written insights & memories of each of their releases on  Destijlrecs.com.  (I strongly urge anyone still reading these notes to consult this site for a much deeper dose of context regarding the entire era). In his remembrance of “The Birth of Both Worlds”, John Fell Ryan of NNCK and Excepter describes our “loft space of epic bohemia” and the celebration that began Saturday evening when No-Neck arrived to Sherman St and continued thru the performances Sunday afternoon all the way until the cruel light of Monday morning cast its ugly glare. He recalled how on Saturday Night some swinging, polyvinyl & leather clad “sex lizards” accidentally stumbled into our all night jam session looking for the bi-weekly S&M orgy that was held on the floor above us. After some confusion they were sent upstairs and none of the drug addled beatniks among us mustered the courage to accept their invitation to investigate the fuck dungeon above. (Although, it should be noted that the sex lizards all returned the following afternoon to watch the concert).\nIn the tradition of the previous Orthodox Easter events, the music began on the rooftop. A brief introductory set/invocation was performed under a light rain by Adam Mortimer’s Egypt is the Magick # project featuring guests Darren “Catfish” Zoltowski on vocals & John Moloney on drums. NNCK began their performance under the drizzle and slowly unleashed a transcendental quagmire of audio/visual configuration. After 35 minutes their set was just entering cruise control & most likely would have elevated & levitated for another 90 minutes or more had some puritan in the building not called the police to stop the show. (A fate that befell several NNCK shows of this era). I was shocked at the unusual level of courtesy & patience the boys in blue displayed as each member of NNCK slowly became aware of their presence and stopped playing the other worldly music one by one. The cops even applauded along with the crowd of straggly drug vultures as the music faded out in a haze of pot smoke. “We don’t care what you do as long as you take it inside” said one lawman much to my stoned amazement. I can guarantee you that adjectives like tolerant or understanding are seldom used to describe Boston’s finest, but fate smiled upon us that Sunday.\nOnce everyone was safely sequestered back inside the loft, Sunburned set up in front of a packed house of about 75. The days of cellphone & internet ubiquity were still in the future & I had spent much of the afternoon answering the landline, telling audience members how to get to our clandestine location. Just moments before our set began, the telephone attached to the wall next to me rang and I answered it with my bass strapped on & plugged in and the whole group ready to play. It was Malcolm Mooney, the original vocalist for Can calling. He wanted me to give our mutual friend Frank van Dan Elzen the message that he was sorry but he wouldn’t be able to attend the party. I assured him that I would let Frank know & hung up the phone and we began playing the music that starts side 2 of this LP.\nAfter the concert ended most of the crowd & some of the musicians departed leaving behind a crew of approximately 25 members of the Sunburned & NNCK inner circles & a few stragglers. One straggler, a strange, burly young Scotsman, who was a co-worker of Cousin Rich, was approaching people, asking (as J.F. Ryan noted) “Are you on acid?”. When one replied “No,” he would ask, “Do you want to be?” and procure his bottle of LSD for one’s inspection. From that point of the night on & forever more he would be known as “Liquid Andrew”. About 15 or so of the roughly 25 party people there went in for a dose and we spent the rest of the night tripping en masse. My memory for the rest of the evening is somewhat hazy but I can distinctly recall Chad Cooper asking me to stop playing my copy of the “Granfalloon” LP by Laser Pace (Takoma, R-9201) as the devious and psychotic prog/funk stylings of that particular album was making some of the heads nervous. It still remains one of my favorite records today.\nShortly after the concert, we compiled what we considered to be the finest of the previous summer’s recordings with a 20 minute excerpt from the Orthodox Easter performance. Kristin offered to create a cd-r only subsidiary of Poon Village (cd-r labels still being relatively novel in ’98) called Thrown to the Wind, specifically to release Mind of a Brother in an edition of 99 copies. The original press came in a jewel case and had a one panel booklet with a heavy matte finish and glossy interior. Released in ’98, this was the only Sunburned product until late 2000 when John Moloney started the Manhand label to release the Jaybird & Wild Animal cd-r’s. Additional copies of Mind of a Brother were released as cd-r’s on Manhand in the label’s traditional brown paper envelope with sticker for several years, but the total press (including the Thrown to the Wind run) was certainly less than 500 copies, probably closer to 300.\nThe bonus material included on the download card covers all the material from the original cd-r that wouldn’t fit on a single LP as well as a long session from April of ’98 leading up to the Easter concert. It seems that Rich Pontius, Marc Orleans & James Coleman are not present on this recording, but Moloney, Brian Donnelly, Chad Cooper, Cousin Rich and myself can be clearly heard investigating themes that would resurface shortly on “Loveletter to Complicated Dreams”.\nLate in 2002, Julian Cope named Jaybird an album of the month on his Head Heritage website. In his review, which made it into print a decade later in his book Copendium (Faber & Faber), Cope recounted the entire Sunburned history up to Jaybird with eerie accuracy (considering virtually no information existed about us anywhere) and paid Mind of a Brother what I consider to be one of the highest possible compliments by comparing it to one of my all-time favorite albums: “…it really reminds me of L. Voag’s legendary 1979 album The Way Out, with tidal waves of sound coming and going…” Thank you Julian.\nMy final anecdote regarding this album just came back to me as I was attempting to get these notes together after much delay. Somehow I had completely forgotten this strange fact and was only reminded of it the other night when I stumbled across another long, psychedelic infused autobiography by Jens Lenkman of the great Swedish cosmic group The Spacious Mind. He recounted his life in music and obsession with psychedelia, particularly the vintage American approach, in a sprawling essay that I urge you all to investigate. (I came across it thru Waxidermy where he regularly posts under the name Floatinghouseman but the link now seems to be removed). I was honored to read about halfway into Jen’s life story that he remembered meeting me at the record shop I worked at in Cambridge, probably around 2002. I recognized him and we struck up a conversation about U.S. psych rarities and shared our mutual enthusiasm for obscure acid rock published by Capitol records. Then I informed him of the bizarre and potentially cosmic coincidence of how both our groups had released albums titled “Mind of a Brother” at virtually the same time. The Spacious Mind cd was called “The Mind of a Brother” and came out in ’99 and even has somewhat similar graphic design. I had been a fan of Jens’ group since I heard their album “Organic Mind Solution” circa ’95 but Jens had heard nothing of Sunburned until we met that day. I wondered whether I had read an interview with him in a zine where he mentioned having an upcoming release with that title and subliminally copped it for Sunburned, but I really don’t think that could be the case. Luckily Jens was as gracious as he is Spacious and was similarly mind blown by the unlikeliness of it all. The fact that I stumbled upon his essay in the middle of the night, in which he reminded me of this forgotten uncanny synchronicity just before I began my long procrastinated notes for this reissue seems to indicate something. Perhaps there may well have been some intercontinental psychic transference happening between these two spacerock ensembles at the ass end of the 20th century.\nThanks to Ted & Byron for finally giving this music a decent format and a new perspective, to Scott for the beautiful layout, to Kristin for getting this particular ball rolling all those years ago and to all the members of Sunburned past, present & future for lending a hand.\nRobert J.

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"I only have one word to describe this boxset: Geez! My Accident is putting it lightly, this is more like \"My Catastrophe\" or \"My Apocalypse\". Let me summarize the four half-hour tapes found within. Tape one: Messy distorted noise and then some! Am I listening to Doktor Kettu here? You sure could have fooled me! Oh wait! A beat! No it's gone... Tape two : An elephant and a moose mating while watching reruns of A Current Affair. The aftermath is beyond description! Go back to tape one, do not pass \"Go!\". Tape three : Hmm... More noise! Two pairs of headphones die out on me. Tape four : The Hototogisu are like purring baby kittens in comparison! Sound is so completely fried in parts it practically goes silent. Throughout this two hour session, the sound sometimes unexpectedly cuts, or fades or shifts, but it's one single, long... mess. Packaging inspired by Caroliner who also included discarded, found crap in the box, so each one is unique! Quite limited.\"",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"A very dark and creepy album this time which reminds me somewhat of the esoteric aesthetics of french electronic composer Igor Wakhevitch. When The 1st Degree fades in after the bizarre spoken word intro with it's heavy guitar riff and cheesy keyboards and flute, you couldn't be blamed for thinking this was some sort of obscure forgotten seventies stoner rock record which was discovered in somebody's garage. I really like the uh... prose on uh... The Air Itself. After the release of The Secret In Disguise, it's fun to hear the group really pushing the psychedelic envelope to it's limit and this record, even though it is quite different to it's predecessor, is as able to liquefy your brain matter. Yer Own Eyes & The Number None sounds once again like something International Harvester could have done thirty years ago (without copying). This is another great album well worth seeking out.\"",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand Of The Man - People\nMH 55 - 2007 - Remastered April 22, 2020\nOriginally released as a cassette in an edition of 50. This tape was recorded one afternoon at the Ecstatic Yod Space in Florence, MA. Played by Paul Labrecque, John Moloney, Sarah O'Shea & Ron Schneiderman. Artwork by John Moloney.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"Here we go! Sunburned have lost their marbles once again!\" Or so were my first impressions when I popped this cassette into my tape deck. After a while though, the chaos found here slowly made sense (or perhaps it's my brain just forcing me to find some sort of meaning). People sounds as if you found yourself at the bottom this humongous, reverberating staircase in an enormous apartment building and you could hear every single sound made from it's inhabitants... all at once! One person is taking a leak, others are preparing dinner, you can barely make out some conversations, or perhaps that's just the TV. In another apartment, some kid is playing with an animal Show'N'Tell toy (-Baboon! -Cougar!), next door there's some pimply-faced teen practicing the drums and not only that, but every time someone comes in the building, the door rings a few chimes. The second side becomes slightly more musical (read: noisy) towards the end. 50 copies!\"",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man might be the last of the great American free rock collectives. There was a time, not too long ago, when every region of this great republic could boast of its own visionary troupe of seekers and improvisers, thrumming at the frequency of the illuminated world. There was Pelt in the south and Jackie-O Motherfucker in the Pacific northwest, No-Neck Blues Band in New York and the iridescent Jewelled Antler out in the Bay Area. And up in the New England wilds, there was The Sunburned Hand of the Man. It was a glorious time to be a weirdo, even amidst the smoldering wreck of the George W. Bush administration. While the pale white hipsters of the early millennial New York rock scene were cutting the canon of American music to a thin rail of pre-approved bands and albums, the amorphous free rock tribes were expanding it boundlessly. It was all in there. A veritable head music awakening. Loft jazz and European free improv, Xpressway and Takoma, Jandek and Elizabeth Cotton, the Taj Mahal Travelers and the Grateful goddamn Dead. David Keenan of The Wire memorably called it the New Weird America. It felt to me like the mystical democracy of Walt Whitman. It was never arch or jittery or wiry; it sprawled like the continent and massed like the seas. It produced some of the most singularly thrilling performances that I ever had the privilege of witnessing. Most of those groups have since gone dormant—disbanded entirely or decomposed into smaller units and solo projects. But the Sunburned Hand of the Man remains.\nOr rather, we might say that the Sunburned Hand has returned. The sudden appearance of the phenomenal \"Headless\" in late 2019 felt like something of a resurfacing. There had, of course, been a steady trickle of obscuro cassettes and CD-Rs over the years, filling out an already bewilderingly immense and impossible to master discography. But Headless felt like their first proper album since the release of the Kieran Hebden-produced \"A\" on Ecstatic Peace! all the way back in 2010. It appears that it was no one-off.\nWhen Sunburned settled on \"Pick A Day to Die\" as their new album’s title, I imagine it sounded more like a cool-ass James Bond movie than a grim memento mori for a plague-stricken nation. But here we are. Assembled from recently revisited recording sessions from between 2007 and 2017, \"Pick A Day to Die\" captures the full range of Sunburned’s sonic jive. The chiming opener “Dropped a Rock” situates Jeremy Pisani’s lovely acoustic guitar within a vast ECM-like spaciousness, even as knocks and creaks of percussion and the almost-animal whine of electronics suggest some enclosing menace just beyond the frame. The tension is eventually relieved by the motorik rip of the killer title track. “Let’s feel the midnight,” vocalist Shannon Ketch commences a solemn Beefheart-esque rant about jet black leather diapers and eight-piece chicken dinners. The greasy cycle-delica of “Pick a Day to Die” is a good reminder that Sunburned always rocked harder and, if they felt like it, nastier than their compatriots in the early aughts shamanic underground. Ketch barks at you nonsensically to “Taste the campfire!” like Iggy taunting the bikers on Metallic K.O. And, indeed, after the space disco nitrous hit of “Flex,” they are back at it. The tight “Black Lights” is more rumble music. The long demented eastern-tinged odyssey “Initials” dominates the second side, laying malfunctioning computer vocals over a serpentine guitar line. The savage album closer “Prix Fixe” is an aborted hardcore number that slowly gives way to bluesy desert rock blowout. The legendary J Mascis lends his inimitable lead guitar to some “Maggot Brain”-like acid rock ascendance.\nThe thing that one has to remember about Sunburned Hand of the Man is that while they were no less committed to vast, ritualistic summonings than their siblings in the American free rock underground, they were perhaps uniquely capable of channeling that cosmic funk. There’s a throb and a groove to Sunburned’s music that made it as much body music as head music. This is a different kind of American weirdness than that which conjures ghosts and threatens to tear down the veil between worlds. This is “free your ass” weirdness that chugs and bounces. It makes us want to get out of our heads where we’ve all been trapped these past months and drive on the freeway or bop down the street or loaf like Walt Whitman in the stoned sun. Like the man said, it makes us want to taste the campfire. Pick A Day to Die. Sure, but definitely not today.\n--Brent S.

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nThis second release sounds like the band in their practice space not doing much more then well... practicing! Like Mahogany Brain and Velvet Underground jamming together, but with the culture clash making it impossible for the two to channel each other's leads. There are some nice weird moments here... This also reminded me of Sun Ra's Cosmic Tones For Mental Therapy... this is a great stoner record. It's perfect music to enjoy in the background on a smoky afternoon (if you are so inclined).",

The Sunburned ones are really getting more and more abstract with each new release! This one is absolutely mind-boggling. Unlike Zample Volume One, which was just way too skeletal for me to enjoy, this one comes at you thick and juicy. That distorted bass buzz sound which has been used on a regular basis is practically sounded throughout this recording and twenty minutes is a perfect length not to over do it! It comes with slightly different 8X11' xeroxed paper artwork with the CD-R housed in a thin paper sleeve and glued to the back. Why have released a cassette at all when this was planned, I have no idea. Besides the cheap-ass artwork, this version is much more convenient.'",

If the Sunburned collective wanted to be easily accessed by a whole new generation of fans, you would think they would present something that is easier to digest, but that's not the case here. This album is a pretty mind-boggling, barely funky affair! Easy Wind, the first track off the album, is a monotonous jam with weird shouted vocals that will have you frown in your seat. Besides Buried Pleasure (which sees the group showing off their folk roots), there is not really anything stable in here; in fact, most of it is just very noisy and strange mutant zombie rock. Listening to Glass Boots is like having someone scoop out your brains with an ice cream spoon and garnishing it with nut clusters and whipped cream! Enjoy!'",

            "about": "Seriously! What the FUCK is that thing on the cover!? It creeps me out! Three songs here, including the mammoth St Francis: a half-hour's worth of droning, ranting, feedbacking, rumbling, puking, defiling, corrupting insanity. Listening to this track with a lucid mind might induce schizophrenia as it most certainly will cause a short circuit in the brain. Some beats do come in at approximately ten minutes in to make some sense out of this clutter, but it's all very unstable. This track is easily the best of the lot as the two shorter tracks sound like a mindless mess of fuck-all noise and shit. Quite confusing and not all that rewarding. Machine is slightly more interesting than it's predecessor. It's an unrelenting five minute punkish, anarchistic noise rock assault which will pierce your eardrums and leave permanent damage. CD-R comes in a jewel case with hideous artwork all glued and cut up haphazardly. Not sure if this is limited.",
            "credits": "released January 5, 2015\nRoach - Manhand 54 - 2007\nThis was recorded live at the Nightlight, Carrboro, North Carolina in March 2007. Sunburned toured to SXSW and back.

The line-up for this show was: MJK, Paul Labrecque, John Moloney, Sarah O' Shea & Taylor Richardson. 'St. Francis' lyrics were shouted out of a kid's book with the same title that Moloney took off the shelf behind the stage. 'Machine' is Black Flag cover. Cory Rayborn provided the recording here. A fun show for us.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' Website:\n'A completely free slab of Sunburnedism which will please long time fans and repel the uninitiated. Recorded live in Munich, Germany in October of 2007, Schmetterling starts off sounding like some guy going bonkers, smashing his fists on a cheap keyboard piano on display in a crowded mall store while all the shoppers are in some sort of slow motion, zombie-like state of daze. It's pretty fucking creepy in parts (those random background noises are quite bewildering). As the tune devolves, it drags us into an industrial-sized furnace where everything, including the band, the crowd, even the music, is being incinerated while huge hydraulic machinery chucks shoppers and crowd members by the dozen into the furnace's fiery mouth. Once everyone has reached the lower depths of hell, the band suddenly break into a groovy jam which even had Satan and Biggie Smalls headbanging along to the beat. A heavily fried and buttered mess to enjoy.'",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man\nShelved Radio - Resonance FM\nLondon, England - 2004?\nThis is an archival find on a cd labeled \"pouncy lp.\" This was recorded at a London radio session we did for Edwin Pouncy's Resonance FM show and it was supposed to be released as an LP with Edwin's artwork possibly on a label Edwin was starting? We don't remember, but this sounds like No Magic Man / Loft era crew.\nRob said it was probably 2004 which sounds right to me. He also said of what he can remember about the session was that \"They hated us.\" I have very little memory of this but we were probably deep into a tour and out to lunch when we were there. Sounds like it! Enjoy.\nArtwork by Taylor Richardson. Sunburned logo by Phil Franklin.\nMusic by Sunburned. Enjoy.",

Includes a printed, folded diazo print by Rob Thomas. no text/information.\nShit Spangled Banner was the psych/art-rock Boston/Cambridge trio of Rob Thomas, Rich Pontius and John Moloney who all went on to form Sunburned Hand of the Man. This is the actual LP, which is a bit different from the 'mu third part' test pressing and the cassette version which came out first.\nMost of the music was recorded on Friday nights in our practice space on Albany Street in Boston onto a Sony Walkman Pro cassette recorder and the album was tweaked and put together at the SSB drink and drug headquarters on Bishop Allen Drive in Cambridge in 1994-1995. That's all I remember. I'll add the test pressing material and the cassette if and when I get around to digitizing it. JM.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'The first few seconds of The Horses All Know lead me to believe that we were going to break away from the band's recurrent tendencies towards all things noise, but the mood of the song rapidly deteriorates and heads into some very dark and terrifying territory. With the distortion cranked all the way up to infinity, any semblance of groove is immediately annihilated and pulverized. Don't get me wrong though, Silence Of Color isn't completely uncompromising and bent on destruction (even though the power saw solo on The Planes Are Low might have you think otherwise), there's actually enough groove in here to have you bobbing your head to the beat with a satisfied smirk on your face, but you might have to dig deeper than usual to find it. The album's pièce de résistance however is the twenty-three minutes long The Color Yellow Is Not Alone, a noise/tape collage come free jazz/ambient jam which would make the Fluxus gang proud. Nice!!!'\n'",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Limited to only thirty-six copies (!?), Sopra L'Influsso is the 2006 DVD-R re-release of the VHS tape they released back in 2002 (it was very limited back then as well). What makes this new version even more interesting than the original is not only the fact it is now available on a much more convenient DVD, but also because it comes with the \"soundtrack\" to the film. The film itself is a bunch of homemade weirdness with extensive use of effects found on an MX-12 machine. Kind of amateurish in a fun way, like a cheaper version of Zappa's 200 Motels. The music however sounds like it is from the band's early period. The jams are funky and psychedelic. Tracks like The Biggest Bird In The World or Bar & Grill could easily have been on albums like Jaybird or Wildanimal. There are more experimental songs like Droolooselum to even things out. Too bad it's so limited.'",
            "credits": "released February 2, 2002\nSopra L'Influsso - Manhand 35 & 36 - 2002\nThis is the soundtrack or audio companion to the video that Sunburned released first on Qbico as a VHS and then the band made a very limited run of dvdrs with a companion cdr of longer versions of music from the film and some other related material circa 2002.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'The opening track on Spraycan In Space (can someone explain the title for me - PLEASE!?) basically sounds like a very long intro. You feel like it's about to begin at any given moment, you just know it's gonna start right about here... no wait... wait... here it is... no... no... I thought it was here but, oh here we go, hold on... soon... [8 minutes ellipse] ... any minute now... aaaand... uhm... BOOM! THERE WE GO! What we have left now is two minutes of good ol' rawk at it's grittiest! Fans of the band at their free(jazz)st will love this track. Things don't gel much more on the second track (which I believe is simply Spraycan In Space Part 2), the mood is relatively similar, but the tune feels just this much more \"out there\". This is where all the cosmic references start making sense. The tune does go Ash Ra Tempel on us on a few occasions, but it's never long before we get sucked back into that sonic black hole which only Sunburned can generate.'",

This could easily be the soundtrack to some obscure 70's porn flick\". I mean, it meets all the possible requirements: funky bassline, rhodes-like keyboard groove, explosive \"money shot\" highs and pounding - \"oomph! yeah!\" - lows... The track eventually drifts off into more psychedelic territory and the blue movie idea slowly fades away, but the track remains quite upbeat and definitely tighter (no pun intended) than most of the group's recent work. The Process Of Weed(ing) Out is a much freer number which reminds me of Mahogany Brain's decontructivist approach to rock. The song barely holds up on it's own and sounds as if it is crumbling to pieces. The drums slowly build up and manage to act as crutches in order to drive the tune forward, but the pace is so quick it's only a matter of time before things fall apart again.",

Bill Nace's side of the tape is not on this bandcamp release.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Yikes! This is some of the weirdest, trippiest Sunburned material in quite some time. I mean, they've always been trippy in some way, but this is actually like being in a drug-infused daze. The ambient synth washes and shimmering atmosphere on the Sunburned side feel like a delusional trek across the desert; as we advance, our mind begins to wander while the increasing hunger induces hallucinations of the most schizophrenic kind. This is some of the most whacked Sunburned music not to fall into their usual noisy tendencies, like some early Klaus Schulze on PCP. Love it! The Bill Nace side is much noisier and definitely completely warped. Like alien signals overloading it's receptors, the sound becomes so intense at times it feels as if the speakers could fry up and explode at any given moment. All three tracks alternate between short peaceful moments and harsh noise; feedback and reverb are always a good combination...'",

This is only the Sunburned side.\nArtwork and editing by Taylor Richardson - 2007\nMathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" says:\n'Ohio's Emeralds fill up the first side of this split tape with a long piece of drawn out psychedelic electronic bleeps and pulses. It sounds like some obscure psychedelic electronic piece from the early 70's from some unknown hippy composer. Droning, borderline ambient/noise music to sooth the soul. As much as I enjoy the first side however, it was Sunburned's side that made me buy this tape in the first place and what a bizarre one this is! Smoke This Now is the name of the track and I would suggest to do anything BUT smoke before listening to it! There is some genuine mind-fuckery going on here. Not only is the piece divided into a multitude of shorter tracks, but each of them are so different and alien-like, it might prove too much for some fans. This very cellular song is one of the most ambient pieces the collective have concocted yet. I personally love it, but if you're into the group's heavier leanings, stay away from this one.'",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" Website:\n\"The story goes that this was a bootleg vinyl of a live recording done without the group's consent. When this was discovered, the group managed to have their dues paid and the recording was then released officially. How much of this is true, I don't know. For all we know, this could very well be a load of bullshit. The Wabana label later released this on CD. The record is mostly straight forward, krautrock-ish jamming. On the second track, the delay effects on the electronic glitches, the ubiquitous flutes and the constant yelling of the word \"war\" (or is that \"whoa\") make it an odd, but interesting little number. The last track is pretty fucking great however. It feels much freer than the rest of the album with cool vocals and very hectic percussion! Worth getting the album just for this piece, otherwise a let down. There's a horrible hell! A horrible place! Bad bad bad...\"",

He shares his thoughts for Louder Than War.\nTrying to describe the music made by Sunburned Hand Of The Man may prove to be a thankless task but I’m going to give it a good shot anyway. Imagine free-jazz played by a basement-dwelling noise-rock band with a penchant for the desert blues of Don Van Vliet and a heroically callous disregard for song structure. With a revolving cast of collaborators the Boston, Massachusetts-based collective have created uncompromising and deeply strange music since the mid-nineties. The droning, psychedelic offspring of Sun City Girls and early Butthole Surfers. It’s one of those gigs where I’m not entirely sure what to expect. One thing’s for certain, this won’t be your average kind of Sunday night.\n“He’s going to get cold feet,” my friend says as he watches vocalist and synth manipulator Shannon Ketch approach the stage without his shoes. It soon becomes apparent that Sunburned Hand Of The Man are a band that do things their own way. Cold feet and splinters be damned. A minute later and Ketch, John Moloney (drums), Mark Perretta (guitar) and Robert Thomas (bass) all start moaning, groaning and wailing into their respective microphones. A couple of minutes after that and Ketch has put on a crudely stitched fabric mask that covers his entire face. With their throats cleared and minds wide open, the band are ready for action.\nWe’re lowered into the band’s skewered world with an incredibly loose, desert-rock jam that evolves into a hypnotic, psychedelic groove. The track gradually descends back into chaos; the music constantly transforming and unravelling right before our eyes (and ears). “And the clouds fall” sings Ketch as he sways to the band’s temperamental swing. It’s the kind of sound that makes other rock bands seem like they’re hemmed in by the tyranny of form and structure. Sunburned Hand Of The Man are unreservedly free and look like they’re having the time of their lives.\nIt’s at this point that the legendary Herb Diamanté appears to join the band on stage. A mysterious, immaculately dressed lounge singer with a penchant for red wine and surrealism. It’s particularly apt as I was trying to describe his act to a friend earlier in the evening. Aubergines and Scott Walker were mentioned. They treat us to a lengthy interpretation of Wasp In A Jamjar that finds our new singer crooning about a half-eaten, hard-boiled egg and a trapped wasp over a truly mesmeric, free-flowing groove. I’m sure it wouldn’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but I’m beaming from ear to ear.\nWhen Moloney dons a rubber alien mask, it seems to act as a cue for the band to let it all hang out. As if they weren’t already. The sound becomes wilder as the night goes on, the five musicians on stage are well and truly in their element. Bursts of brilliantly frazzled harmonica are added to the subversive stew and the band are in full swing. Diamanté tells us with a grin, “you’re all doomed! This is a locked room with padded walls and no key”. A gothic lounge singer by day and an axe-wielding maniac by night? Perhaps I’ve got a serious case of Stockholm Syndrome, but I’m really enjoying myself.\nIn the midst of the madness, someone hands Diamanté a hard-boiled egg. Thankfully, it isn’t half-eaten. If birds were to hatch from such an egg, I’m sure they’d be very strange indeed. Diamanté says he might step out for a quick cigarette, unfortunately for him, the band and the crowd have different ideas. In a beautifully ironic twist, Diamanté has now become something of a prisoner. Trapped, you might say, like a wasp in a jam jar. The crowd begs for more. One more trip into the psychedelic wastelands of Sunburned Hand Of The Man. The best Sunday night I’ve had in ages!\n-Andy Brown 2022",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Taken from recordings of their 2007 tour of the UK, The Sweeter Natural finds the Sunburned clan in a fucked up, experimental mood. Minus a few all-out MC5 heavy jams (Developer is an rock'n'roll amphetamine fest filled with barely audible shrieks and the most inhumane beating of the drums), this release will certainly have you bending out of shape and drooling uncontrollably. Some tracks reminded me of what was released on Attica Rectangle: bizarre, early-Residents at their most lobotomizing and dangerous with fucked up samples or cheap keyboard sounds played at varying speeds (check out Ducking Phones or the incomprehensible On Busted Legs). No tracks truly stand out above the others, but this release is proof that Sunburned can pretty much do whatever the fuck they want and get away with it simply because no matter how familiar a tune might sound, there will always some new and surprising element in there somewhere.'",

            "about": "FRANKLIN’S MINT “TEMPORARY”\nFranklin’s Mint is an ongoing solo, song-writing project of Philip Franklin. Starting in 2004 with the release of “GOLD”, I have worked with incredible talent over the years.\nBeginning in the early 1980’s as drummer with the New York hard core punk band BORSCHT, playing at such local clubs as CBGB’s, A7 and The Rock Hotel, I began writing lyrics and had a deep interest in song writing. With a Fine Arts degree from S.U.N.Y Purchase, I also played in various college bands.\nAfter moving to San Francisco in 1992 to join the Art Rock band CAROLINER RAINBOW I began to tour extensively throughout the USA, Japan and Australia; coming here for the first time with “desk-metal” band FAXED HEAD in 1997, which featured Trey Spruance from MR. BUNGLE and Gregg Turkington aka NEIL HAMBURGER fame.\nThe following year I joined Trey Spruance, Danny Heifetz, Trevor Dunn, Bar McKinnon (all original members of Mr Bungle) and violinist Eyvind Kang in the first touring line up of the Secret Chiefs 3, playing percussion and drums. We also made our television debut during that tour, on cult Saturday morning music show, RECOVERY.\nI continued playing in the Secret Chiefs 3 until 2001 then returned to the US East Coast, to Boston where I began playing with the free folk psyche-improv collective SUNBURNED HAND OF THE MAN, of which 2 members are featured on this latest recording.\nThis collection of original songs is my very first release in Australia and also a return to working with Danny Heifetz, who made Sydney his home over 20 years ago. Danny recorded and mixed these songs as well as contributing his amazing musicianship here in Sydney at his PLATFORM 28 Studios. The songs were recorded between December 2020 to February 2021, during the pandemic and the CD was pressed in Victoria.\nManhand #176\nPhil Franklin - Sydney, Australia - March 2021",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Terminator 9 is proof to me that no matter HOW fucked up Sunburned Hand Of The Man can become, they'll still be able to go one step further into the extreme and confuse me beyond belief (God bless their souls!). Just getting through the opening two minute long Murder The Future I is best left to hardcore fans only, no one who is unfamiliar with the collective would enjoy this for it's own sake (wait until you reach part IV!). To me, Sunburned have become a bit like German film director Rainer Werner Fassbinder, in the sense that one can't get a clear picture of the director with just one film, it's after a few films (and in Sunburned's case: albums) that one can begin to see the bigger picture and appreciate the subtle details in a broader sense. As a unit all by itself, Terminator 9 might prove insufficient for new comers. Murder The Future II & III is the closest the band comes to being melodious, like a cross between The Necks and Klaus Schulze at their fuzziest.'",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man & Circle\nThis album is a live recording of both bands playing as one. Free Download.\nFrom Brainwashed.com:\n\"Edited down from hours of recordings, this collaboration between America's Sunburned Hand of the Man and Finland's Circle is a thrilling collection of improvisations and jams. Not only is it a great first time partnership but I like it better than a lot of either band's previous recordings. With any luck this is the start of a long-lasting and prolific relationship.\nThis combination of these two bands works spectacularly well. Both bands retain their own distinctive style but bend their respective methods to fit in with the others' methods. Granted, neither of them had to sacrifice much of their own take on playing as both come from a very similar school of thought where anything goes. The music shifts like scenes in a dream, a solid rhythm one minute falling into a formless squall of delay soaked guitar. The vocals are buried in the mix and are more like cries in the distance than any sort of traditional rock centrepiece.\nThere is a serious sense of urgency that runs through the first three pieces. This comes to a boil with the frantic jamming on \"Heinävelho\" where the drums sound like they are being played too fast and too often and everyone is desperately trying to stay together. It sounds incredible, the insistent force of the piece shoving the listener forward whether they want to go or not. This could happily go on for the entire disc but the fadeout at the end of \"Vuoren Valloitus\" unfortunately brings this chapter of album to a close.\nThe remainder of The Blaze Game features a looser selection of cuts from the sessions. \"Yksi Hirvi, Miljoona Metsästäjää\" is undoubtedly the best part of the album (a tall order considering the quality of the other tracks). Here Circle's Krautrocking—which makes their live show so compelling—comes to the fore. The bass leads the rhythm section on and on and on, the other instruments and vocals dance around it before some seriously freaked out saxophone takes things to another level.\nI was a bit apprehensive about Sunburned Circle as separately I find both bands to be hit or miss with their studio output. However, these two groups go together like bread and butter. The spark between them seems to come naturally and freely. Each piece becomes its own microcosm where every element of the music works perfectly with the other elements. And one thing that all the tracks have in common is that I could gladly listen to a lot more of any of them. Bearing in mind that these are all culled from longer jams perhaps some day a large box set of unedited recordings might be made available. In the meantime I am more than happy to make do with this fantastic album.",

Cousin Rich, Robert Thomas, with special guests from Ireland - Cillian Sparks & Barry Mangan.\nTracks 1 & 12 were from a separate event at the same location.\nTracks 2 - 10 were from a long booze-fueled jam on a friday night at the loft when some Irish friends were in town around Christmas around 2000/2001. Rob wasnt present at this session.\nAll of this early sunburned music was most likely recorded with 2 mics plugged directly into the 2 - 1/4\" mic inputs on a tape deck that Moloney and Cooper found in the trash on Paris Street in Everett, Massachusetts in 1997.",
            "credits": "released June 1, 2002\nFrom Mathieu Duval's My Record Collection website:\n'On this album, the ranting which is to feature more often on later albums makes it's first appearance. I'm not to sure what they're blabbing on about on the first title track, but it certainly has this hippy-beatnik vibe to it! The music on this track is not that great. It's on the ten part Glens which follows is where things get interesting. On the first one, there is a very prominent buzzing keyboard sound which gives the song a very dark and gloomy feel; the funkiness of their earlier albums is completely absent for the first time. The rest of the series sounds like the a bunch of monkeys and trolls covering some Residents songs! The sixth part is absolutely insane! Don't really know what to make of it, but it puts a smile on my face! It all ends with the beautiful, eastern-tinged jam that is My Wings, My Vision. Pretty fucking strange album, but an interesting new direction for the group.'",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand Of The Man - The Dry Triangle\nLoft Tapes Volume 2 - MH92\nMusic recorded at the Sunburned Loft, 7 Sherman Street, Charlestown, MA, date unknown. Players were probably Rob Thomas, Rich Thomas, Brian Donnelly, John Moloney, Rich Pontuis, & Chad Cooper. Originally released in 2008 as a cassette in an edition of 50. Art by Sarah O'Shea.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n'Sunburned Hand Of The Man continue their series of \"loft tapes\" which they started earlier this year with the quadruple tape release of Bootcamp: Moses. These are basically compilations of early material which wouldn't really fit on any album and they run the gammut from the weird to the extremely weird. For example, the first two tracks on this second volume range from a sped up version, chipmunk voices and all, of a wild gypsy folk song played by the camp fire to a sped up version of a bizarre traditional chinese folk song. It's INSANE!!! I don't know what's up with the high-pitched voices; maybe it's an early stylistic approach, maybe it's a fuck up. Whatever it is, it gives these tunes a truly creepy and deranged vibe that I had never heard from them before. Freaky late night shroom jams? Entranced incantations for lost souls? Lamentations for unknown anthropomorphic gods? The aural equivalent of salvia divinorum?'",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website\n'How many bands can boast about being able to release pretty much whatever the fuck they want, get away with it and be praised for it!? No matter how familiar their sound might become with time, Sunburned have managed to forge a distinct sound for themselves which follows through each new release. How is this possible when pretty much anything goes? The Mouth At The End Of The Finger might sound familiar, as if I had heard it time and time again. Perhaps it's simply some elements or sound bits that I recognize from previous albums, perhaps it's just a similar mood, yet I can't help but thinking of it as new and unique! Such conflicting feelings invade and confuse me with each new release. Take The Problem Solver for example (my favorite track on the album), you could swap it with any track off of any other album by the band and no one could ever tell the difference. Universality without redundancy is a rare achievement.'",
            "credits": "released September 1, 2008\nThe Mouth At The End Of The Finger - Manhand 79 / Spirit of Orr SO75R - 2008\nSunburned moved out of its loft in 2005, in 2007 Byron Coley's Ecstatic Yod New Grass Center For Underground Culture in Florence, Massachusetts, along with Ron's Surefire warehouse in Brattleboro, Vermont became regular playing spaces for the group. This is a session from the Yod. Ron Schneiderman is responsible for the art, titles and production of this which was released as a cdr in 2008.",

Celebrated internationally for more than 30 years, and recently screened as part of the \"Day for Night\" program at the 2006 Whitney Biennial, Invasion will be released as a fully restored and mastered director's cut DVD.\nDVD FEATURES\nHigh-quality transfer from the original 16mm film, with color correction supervised by the director\nThe legendary soundtrack, newly remastered by Tim Barnes, featuring The Universal Mutant Repertory Company (Loren Standlee, Ziska Baum, Angus MacLise, Raja Samayana, Tony Conrad, Henry Flynt and Jackson MacLow)\nTwo new, never-before-released alternative soundtracks to \"Invasion\" by Sunburned Hand of the Man and Acid Mothers Temple SWR (Tsuyama Altsushi, Yoshida Tatsuya and Kawabata Makoto)\n16-page commemorative booklet featuring mylar photography and poetry by Ira Cohen and Angus MacLise, and critical texts by Ian Macfadyen and Allan Graubard\n\"Brain Damage,\" a new film directed by Ira Cohen and produced by BASTET created from never-before-seen original 16mm outtakes, featuring a new soundtrack composed by Will Swofford with the Expanded Instrument System\n\"From The Mylar Chamber,\" an original slideshow of 60 mylar photographs with soundtrack by Angus MacLise and original poetry by Ira Cohen.\nDirector's Commentary track by Ira Cohen\nABOUT \"INVASION\"...\nIra Cohen: \"It was in 1968, the year before Woodstock, between the giant bottle of liquid mercury Tony Conrad found in a doorway on 42nd St. and the Mylar chamber, we experienced a shared voyage conceived in three parts: The Opium Dream, Shaman and Heavenly Blue Mylar Pavilions, an alchemical journey born of out common consciousness -- culminating in the akashic bindu drop swirling in the sky's reflected azure. No minimalism here, but a maximalist adventure . . .\"\nJ. Hoberman in the Mar. 16, 2006 Village Voice:\"Part 'Dr. Strange,' part 'Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome,' ['The Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda' is] so High '60s that you emerge from its 20-minute vision perched full-lotus on a cloud of incense, chatting with a white rabbit and smoking a banana.... 'Invasion' is a languidly opiated costume ball in which an assortment of masked and painted bohos, some sporting outsize elf ears, loll about a candlelit, Mylar-lined set, blowing soap bubbles and nibbling majoon. ...In lieu of action, Cohen uses all manner of superimposition and prismatic image-splitting; his big effect, however, is the deliquescent Mylar reflection. What saves 'Invasion' from preciosity is the vague menace of Angus MacLise's improvised pan-piping, tabla-tapping, creature-yipping score. Although this masterpiece of Tibetan-Moroccan-Druidic trance music was reissued on CD several years ago, it truly blossoms in conjunction with the exotic smorgasbord served at Cohen's psychedelicatessen.\"\nLearn more about Ira Cohen:  www.iracohen.org",

            "about": "The Mylar Tantrum Part 2 - SBR-171\nArchical discovery of 2 alternate takes for the Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda soundtrack that we did for Arthur Magazine in 2006.\nWe got together over 2 nights in early 2006 at our Charlestown, MA HQ to record an alternate soundtrack for Ira Cohen's \"Invasion of Thunderbolt Pagoda\" film that Jay Babcock and his Arthur Magazine was reissuing on dvd. He asked us and Acid Mother's Temple to produce 2 alternate soundtracks to the film which to our shock would appear alongside Angus Maclise's masterpiece. We played along to a VHS copy of the film through an old-school tube color TV.\nPresented here are 2 other complete passes at the movie, I believe that the final version was a composite of a couple of takes but I can't hear any of that music here, but I may be brain-damaged, who knows?\nWe did some performances of this live too, sometimes with Ira Cohen reading, which was always a lot of fun. We miss him.\nThis band is always about rolling the dice, especially live and sometimes it works, and sometimes it FAILS. You tell us what you think about these, we didnt think these cut the mustard for the release at the time, but they sound interesting now. the hard drive files lead me to believe that we did 6 takes of this but i could only find these 2 alternate completed files for now, check it out...\nPlayed by Dave Bohill, MJK, John Moloney, Marc Orleans, Rich Pontius, Taylor Richardson, Rob Thomas, and Ron Schneiderman.\nRun through the new matrix by John Moloney and cover photgraph by Robert Thomas - 2020.",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man - The Ox of Oh\nTarot & Bananas 1\nCassette-only edition of 100 - originally released in 2009.\nSounds like a Sunburned Charlestown loft recording circa 2003-05.\nMathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website says...\n\"Don't be fooled by the first few minutes of muddled noise and vapid randomness which kicks off this tape-only album by Sunburned. It might sound completely pointless at first, but as the tune unfolds, it slowly jells into one of those wicked druggy jams the collective are renowned for. The second track might also sound naive, but this one immediately sucks us into it's unhurried lo-fi stoner ambience. By the time those fucked up vocals find their way into the song, soon followed by a wild sax skronk solo, we're already in a profound daze. The next two tracks sound like those fucked up instrumental synthesizer tracks by Sun Ra at their most debilitating. The very last track, on the other hand, is pure mind-crumbling noise. The Ox Of Oh is the very first release on Michael K's (of Sunburned) own Tarot & Bananas label and is limited to 100 copies..\"",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website\n'I really hope this will get a wider release because there is some top notch Sunburned madness on this tape. The whole first side is filled by the amazing Horse Country Blues, a fifteen minute exercise in head-crushing excessiveness! Some parts sound like a cross between spaghetti western-era Ennio Morricone as interpreted by Acid Mothers Temple (it certainly is as loud). The last few minutes of this track are so fucking intense, the drums so unrelenting and the noise so out-of-control, it's sure to cause a concussion in some listeners! Simply brilliant! The second side includes two tracks of Sunburned's bizarre poetry/rants (which you either love or hate) à la beatnik generation. I love it when they fall into surreal territory, but it's practically impossible to make out what is being said here. The closing Wooden Welcome is a brief return to pounding heavydom before the tape abruptly ends, leaving you begging for more!'",

            "about": "some very kind words from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection\" website....\nHere it is! My absolute favorite Sunburned Hand Of The Man record, the only one I regularly listen to. This one is so joyfully fucked up that I never get tired of it. The music here is of the most psychedelic, brain-melting kind, like a shamanist experience in the amazonian jungles with body paint, peyote and lots of smoke and wild animals. There is plenty of delay, and colorful vocals throughout. When I listen to Index Of Heat, I actually feel like I am exploring the thoughts of a schizophrenic individual (or are those scary voices coming from inside my head?). This track is without a doubt the highlight of the album, but most of the record is in the same vein (and flows like one long, continuous track). There is no other album by the band that sounds remotely like this and it's so far out into deep space that I doubt they ever will peak like this again. It's just that good!",
            "credits": "released March 1, 2004\nThe Secret in Disguise - Manhand (Finga) 13 - 2004\nThis was recorded one night in September 2003 at the Sunburned Loft in Charlestown, Massachusetts. That was avery busy time for the band, The Wire magazine with Sunburned on the cover had just come out and we were in full-on prep mode for our first tour to the UK / Europe in October 2003. It was a lively time.\nSID was self-released by the band with glass-mastered cds, phil franklin screen-printed cardstock sleeves with Joshua Burkett's hand-drawn Sunburned logo on the front. Rob Thomas's artwork on the inside cover and a photo of Furrface (Paul Labrecque) during a situation in Alaska, on the back.\nEven after listening to this for the first time in years, i can't figure out who plays what and there are no liner notes beyond the tiny insert. we'll take that as a good sign..we hope you will too.",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website\n'This is the first double CD-R album by Sunburned (not those multiple cassette monsters) since the incredible Double Puberty. The Spatial Crime Symbol might not be quite as impressive but it sure will catch the unfamiliar off guard. In fact it's quite a confusing album and will appeal mostly to those who enjoy the Sunburned clan at their most impenetrable. A shorter version of Rat Sweat (an alienating, scat-heavy post-beatnik rant by a deranged lunatic) from Weekend At Burnie's 2 features here once again. More than half of these tracks include a similar type of weird, yet lyrical prose which is often hit-or-miss. The few musical bits on the album run the gamut between bizarre ambient-like experimentations, cheesy no wave/punk-inspired pop tunes and outrageous metal tidbits. And then there's everything in between. I doubt anyone will enjoy this album from start to finish, but like most of the band's more erratic works, there's always a few gold nuggets to be found.'",
            "credits": "released July 15, 2008\nThe Spacial Crime Symbol - Manhand 82 - 2008\nThis Sunburned double cdr was compiled of various post-loft recordings, both live and in the studio from 2007 / 2008.\nvarious studio recordings from Justin Pizzoferrato's Bank Row Studios in Greenfield, MA - metal duo trips from the Ecstatic Yod space - acapella hardcore - instant drug scuzz - accents on poetry - accents on prose - western mass new home recordings - vocals from gozzy's van - the mancunian tribute band recordings from Mick Flower's house in Leeds - and a feel-good, sing-along cover from Mick's kitchen to close it out.\nThis was compiled and manufactured as a double cd-r while the band had a few days off in Leeds mid-tour in 2008. not many were made available afterwards for some reason. this set really captures the vibe nicely back then. we were having a lot of fun. artwork by John and Ron.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Incredibly short yet incredibly sweet outing by the sunburned ones. The Splintering is a two part epic (which is probably where the title comes from). The first part feels like a quick nod back to The Secret In Disguise; the same vocal effects are used as is the cheap electronic lullaby tune. It's not quite as potent as The Secret, but it's acidic nature will certainly burn a hole through your skull nonetheless. It's when the song shifts gears towards the middle mark that it becomes way more chaotic and fucked. Drones, un-tuned guitars, zoned-out vocals and other assorted noises make their way into your ears and tamper with your brain cells. Instant lobotomy! There's an incredibly creepy ranting bit towards the end of the track which must be heard to be believed. It basically sounds like someone is reading a passage from the Book Of The Dead from the film Evil Dead.'",

            "about": "2000? 2001? 2002? I'm not feeling too forensic right now. This is a Franklin's Mint set from the legendary and sorely missed Tir Na Nog Irish pub, blasting zone & indoor blizzard in Union Square, Somerville, Massachusetts.\nI was a deep operative in the Irish Trad pub, booze and shnozz scene in Boston and Somerville from 1996 - 2006, working as a bartender. As a result, Sunburned got asked to do every Wednesday night at the Burren in Davis Square, Trad out the front and us in the back room. They paid us $200 a night and it was free admission. It was great, but we had to figure out how to play songs to the public because the sets were so long, and people could get hostile when it was 100% freestyle.\nWe used that back room to host other bands too, Michael Hurley, Spires in Sunset Rise, Feathers, Suntanama, NNCK? and it was free to anyone so it was a lot of fun and we learned how to play to strangers who sometimes hated us...\nThe Burren shows were the reason why I started making the cdrs. People kept asking us if we had anything for sale so I took Rob's rough sketches (without asking) that he was working on for a future record and made the Jaybird and Wild Animal cdrs. Manhand was born at the Burren...\nFranklin's Mint was born around this time too and Phil led us on his own songs, we learned a bunch of covers and did a lot of recording.\nTir Na Nog was the coolest, more musically exclusive, of the Irish music pubs and I've seen some jaw-dropping Irish trad fire music played in there. Robert, the owner, always liked us and he used to work with Sunburned Dave Bohill's Irish dad who owned a pub in Chelsea (I think). I think he knew Dave as a little kid and was psyched to see him in a band.\nSunburned played in Tir Na Nog once, which i know because I have the poster but I don't remember a minute of it. This Franklin's Mint set stands out to me becasue they gave us a Monday night which was important as the Friday Night for everyone in the bar trade so the place was full of hardcore music heads, professional drinkers, and bar workers.\nThis is my favorite set Franklin's Mint ever played and one of my personal favorite live shows i've ever been involved with. It was FUN, it was LOOSE, everyone sounds good together, gang vocals on every song, Betsy Nichols' amazing vocals, and the immaculate monster guitar playing of Tony Goddess of Papas Fritas. I thought I lost this cdr but I found one in the closet so here it is. It goes good very loud or with headphones..\nP.S. Rob's banter on track 12 tells me this show is from 2005!!\nPhil Franklin - Acoustic Guitar / Vocals\nTony Goddess - Electric Guitar / Vocals\nJohn Moloney - Drums / Vocals\nBetsy Nichols - Vocals\nRobert Thomas - Bass / Vocals\nOriginally released as a cdr -MH62- in an edition of 150 in February of 2008.\nJohn Moloney - Northampton, MA - April 2021.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Eclipse Records released this as their first of many influential recordings; first on limited edition vinyl in 2003, but due to the great success and demand, it was later re-issued on CD. The record is quite good, but it's nowhere as good as the earlier, psych-jams that were Jaybird or Wildanimal. The first track for example, sounds pretty tame: a mantra chant accompanied by frenzied cries and simple percussion. It sounds ok, but two minutes would have been enough. Show Of Hands is interesting for the last few minutes of the song when things get really intense and loud. The Easy Ease is a favorite of mine with it's drone and strange keyboard shrieks. Always Correct would be dismissible if it weren't for the incredible distortion blast at two-and-a-half minutes in! The real highlight however is Rivershine, a nine minute drone-jam which includes the aforementioned distorto-blast throughout.'",
            "credits": "released January 29, 2015\nTrickle Down Theory Of Lord Knows What - Eclipse Records ECL-022 - 2004\nRecorded at the Sunburned Loft. Artwork by Phil Franklin.\nPitchfork - 7.2 rating...\nJeff Seelbach writes:\n'On the brief insert for The Trickle-Down Theory of Lord Knows What, Sunburned Hand of the Man leave their address and say, “Come on by sometime.” Few notions characterize their music as well as this sentiment. This is not to say that Sunburned will shake-hands with everything walking in the door; but if something new strikes them, well then damn, throw it in the mix somewhere.\nMost of the tracks lay some kind of foundation, usually a steady tribal thump or a thick drone, from which a shambling orchestra of other noises arise, recede, and otherwise just hang out on the couch for a while. “Spell it Out” begins with distant yelling, proclamations even, and then a steady rhythm of drums, bongos, and cymbals that rattle constantly forward. From outside the percussion, a deep foggy voice arrives. It could be little Johnny with a toy megaphone, or it could be Jim Jones haunting over his followers. The scene turns a bit ominous. From the next room, however, some folks are hootin’ and hollerin’ and even making bird calls as they shuffle a tambourine around. Reverb-drenched guitars push some space into the room and then the whole thing cuts out for the next song to begin.\nOn Side B, “Rivershine” pulls no punches. Something low threatens to envelop the whole thing from the beginning. Whether this is instrumental drone or shamanistic vocal hardly matters. More voices moan and sing in the distance, and then a lighter rhythm eases in, this time from a simple kick-tom drum kit. Some different friends came over this day, because one of them plays flute and another swiped an organ from Bitches Brew. More percussive elements join the fray, and a quick monkey-vocal disarms the mood. This is the best kind of group mess: everything easing forward, disjointed but coming together, excited to see who will jump in next. In this case, a crispy distorted guitar wooshes in and out, surging and fading, a little bit of danger pushing at the edges.\nIn a certain sense, sets like these are very similar and very different at the same time. Many of the same elements (drums, rattling percussion, vocal wails, reverberating drones, etc.) are present in every track. After a superficial listen, the songs might even sound the same. The juice is in the details, however – a few guttural shrieks, the little Casio rhythm buried below, and, is that a steel drum in “Show of Hands?” – these spontaneous sleights of hand are where tracks distinguish themselves. With Trickle-Down, Sunburned walk a line between loose, social music and something driven and darker.'",

Comes with lyric sheet and sticker in a hand painted fold-in cover. Edition of 100. Co-released with ManHand Records, Massachusetts, USA. MH 195.\n\"I’m happy to report\nThere’s something to report\nBeen too long of nothing going on\nStatic on the waves\nMagic on the pavement\nDon’t walk away\nGot to lift up every lid\nTo find out, where it’s been\nGot to face the fruits of death\nBefore you give up your last breath\nWhy does life take so long?\nAs soon as you get it, then it’s gone\nIf only I could appreciate\nIf only I didn’t hesitate so long.\nIt’s not good-bye, it’s good luck\nI got hit by a garbage truck\nTrash can print across my face\nPermanent smell of waste\nWalk a mile in my shoes\nGet the stepped in dog shit blues\nHere the sun is at your back\nFeel the clock start to crack\nWhy does life take so long?\nAs soon as you get it, then it’s gone\nIf only I could appreciate\nIf only I didn’t have to wait so long.\n“Such a long, long time to be gone, and a short time to be there”-Robert Hunter\"",

I'm not (yet) very familiar with Paul Flaherty, but I barely hear anything else but the boys from Massachusetts here. Side One is one of the most FUCKED UP things I've ever heard the band come up with... EVER!!!. Seriously, this one even rivals with my love of The Secret In Disguise it's so fucking out of this world! F'd up electronics, the gang-banging of a saxophone, funky lo-fi beats and an almost zealous worshipping of a vocabulary enhancer (I love the letter \"B\" so fucking much man!!) all adds up to some of the most mind-blowing music I've heard from the group in ages! Side Two, although it is mellower, remains as brain-dissolving as the first. Flaherty takes on a bigger role here, but there's enough of the Sunburned touch to let you know who's boss. Flipped vocals, backwards music samples? Yeah! We've got another winner here!'",
            "credits": "released March 1, 2010\nUnmuzzled Ox - Ecstatic Peace E#58D / Manhand 110 - 2010\nThis is a board recording of Sunburned with Paul Flaherty, sax GIANT from Connecticut, from the now long-gone, Eagle's Nest, in downtown Northampton, Massachusetts. Its a really weird recording because the only things going through the massive, All-Peavy PA was the sax, the vocals and some electronics. The rest of the band sound is just bleed onto the 2 live mics on stage. Terry the Sound Engineer, took the liberty to add weirdo board effects to Paul's sax and thats also him giving the last call announcements.\nThis is my personal all-time favorite Sunburned record (JM). Its totally fried. Download includes info insert and liner notes by Matt Krefting.\nOriginally released as a cassette on Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace and then in a vinyl numbered edition of 200 on Sunburned's own Manhand label.",

The way some of the harsher backwards portions of the material blend with blissed-out voice clouds produces a sensation of otherness as slippery as an eel. That the eel is glowing neon and trapped inside a bubble of lava-gas makes no nevermind.\nHeard as a whole, Voizes & Ragui floats into a place that no one expected to exist when it did, and which swiftly ceased to exist once it was done. A unique plateau, balanced between the unexplainable and purely enjoyable, which challenges as it accepts, puts off as it embraces, and wraps its weird tendrils around your brain’s pleasure fronds as though it’s the best friend you ever had.\" - Byron Coley",

We played a lot. We recorded everything. We took the winter off and shifted to the TV shows hosted by Shannon. Now we're able to play again outside and just this last week we started playing inside and started overdubbing.\nHere's the first result and we hope you like it. This is the first \"new\" sunburned in a long time...This is the sound of opening the mindcrypt from the inside. We're gearing up to record a new record or 2 at the end of May. We're all ok and feeling optimistic. We also can't thank you, the community of fans, friends and supporters for tuning into what we do month after month. We are grateful. Thank you...\nMusic played by:\nConrad Capistran\nGary War\nJeremy Pisani\nJohn Moloney\nRobert Thomas\nRonald Schneiderman\nSarah Gibbons\nShannon Ketch\nTaylor Richardson\nSpecial Guest: Margot Church\nRecorded by Moloney / Sequence and artwork by Ron.\nThe basics were recorded in 2020, overdubs recorded May 6 & 7, 2021.",

            "about": "Sunburned Hand of the Man - Wedlock\nEclipse Records ECL-046 / Sunburned Records (Manhand) 16 & 17. Released in 2005 as a double LP in a one-time edition of 1000 copies.\nRecorded straight to a Sony Mini-DV camera. Procession is a sound collage by Robert Thomas.\nSounds by, Agent Z, Agent W, David Bohill, Chris Corsano,Chad Cooper, Critter, Phil Frankliin, Paul Labrecque, John Moloney, Marc Orleans, Rich Pontius, Rob Thomas, Ron Schneiderman, Christine Steele, Valerie Webb and others...Released by Ed Hardy at Eclipse Records. Most, if not all, of the Polaroid Land-Camera Photos were taken by Marc Orleans. Other photos were taken by other members, unfortunately there are no credits on the record. The art was laid out by Rich Pontius. Most of the drums later in the Lp are played by a couple of 4 year olds..\nFrom Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"This double LP is the result of a stay in Alaska during the wedding of a close friend of the group. They performed at the ceremony and these are the recordings from those sessions. Does it sound romantic? Has the Sunburned clan conformed and created what would have been considered appropriate wedding music? Of course not! Does it sound exotic and adventurous? You betcha! Perfect music for a young modern couple and with the Alaskan landscape in the background, I could only imagine how incredible this must have been. By itself, the music sounds like pretty standard SHOTM, with none of the excessive weirdness of the later records. They do sound quite untamed and wild however while performing their own brand of exploratory psych jams. The sound is quite raw and lo-fi, giving it that extra earthy feel. A beautiful wedding gift from these artists that we can all share.\"\n-7.5 rating on Pitchfork\n- \"one of the best double albums of all time\" - Edwin Pouncey - Wire Magazine\nDusted review:\n\"By my count, this double LP is the fifth Sunburned clan project to drop in 2005, a year in which the band has been mining consistently fresh and often rewarding musical territory. The CD-Rs Manhunt in D and Zample, as well as the Bastet release No Magic Man, sport tighter funkier Krautrock grooves and a new interest in chopped and looped sample excursions and pure electronic experimentation. Wedlock was actually recorded in June 2003, during the Alaskan wedding of members Paul Labrecque and Valerie Webb. In hindsight, it becomes a prequel, transitioning away from the more chest-rattlingly chaotic tribal squall of earlier efforts, serving as the missing link to the group's newly emerging aesthetic.\nThe opening Procession cuts up snippets of pre-wedding festivities and is as bold a recorded statement as the group has ever made. Little bits of Beethoven piano sonatas, slide guitar riffs and jovial conversation vie for prominence in a collage that's somehow never too busy. Procession segues cinematically into Tent City Roller, which sounds, in comparison, more like one of the beat-driven long-form freakouts beloved of SHOTM fans. All the jingle-jangle rhythms and rattles are present, and so are the customary delay-drenched vocal rants, but the whole thing is subservient to a loping hypnofunk beat that gradually morphs into a grinding Krautgroove more reminiscent of early Can than of 2003 Sunburned. Sure, other tracks on the album bring back the largely acoustic and polyrhythmic noise-wall so commonly associated with this group. Salmon Sez, being a noteworthy example but the epic title track is another fauret into the uhr-groove. After an electronically tinged industrial opening section, the 1970s kick in with a vengeance; the drums are way in the pocket, the heavily phased guitar and minimally riffing bass are infectious and fun.\nIn fact, fun abounds throughout Wedlock, due in large part to the fact that everybody sounds like they're having a hell of a time. Energy and excitement levels are obviously high, and every one of the seven tracks here is shot through with snippets of conversation, laughter and excesses of celebration. The best man's speech ends the last side on an abstractly humorous and touching note, just before somebody (Val?) says Alright, let's do this cake thing. It's a fittingly spontaneous conclusion to a neat piece of real-life performance art. \"",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's \"My Record Collection\" website:\n\"Understandably expecting more of the same mind-fuckery found on the Weekend At Burnie's 2 LP, I was pleasantly surprised to hear this short 7\" outing was much tighter than it's sister release. The whole A-side's is filled with the amazing Smokescreen, a slow jam driven by a funky bassline, irritating background feedback and the occasional burst of Tourette syndrome inspired poetry. If this would have been the only song on the 7\", I would still recommend it, but fear not, there's plenty more goodies. The B-side holds mostly short little sound snippets which are either bizarre jam excerpts or Zample-like sound atrocities. No matter how fucked up though (and believe me, some songs will drag you down into Sunburned's creepy schizophrenic world), there's still a nice flow to these tracks which I couldn't find on the LP. No clue how limited this is and for some reason, the Manhand catalog number is the same as their Civil Complaint cassette!\"",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Holy psychedelic miasma! I can imagine the red lights of the den, the smoke, the furry orange carpets and the palliette. I can see the people dancing, their bodies contorted because of the wiggly sounds, like a hundred hungry worms reaching for the morning sun. Everything is in a fish eye perspective. You're not sure if that girl with the bandana is actually two feet away or at the other side of the room. You reach out to her (she's pretty), but you hit dead air. Besides, the sight of your hand waving is far more interesting. People are talking. You wonder if it's about you for a second, maybe they're teasing? Nah, it's them... it's just them. You're your own person. You see through their scheme and congratulate yourself. Fuzzy voices, Satan, he speaks to you at times, or maybe a cat in heat, regardless it's all heart shapes and triangles. No fret. No fret man! The shit just hit the jazz and it's fucking sweet!'",

            "about": "Wild Animal\nManhand 004 - 2001\nOriginally released as a cdr in different small editions.\nA Sunburned Classic.\nFeaturing – Brian Donnely, Cooper, Capistran, Cousin Rich, Critter, Bohill, Moloney, Orleans, Franklin, Pontius, R Thomas\nRecorded live in Massachusetts. 2000-2001. Some of this material comes from the Stone For... Concert on Amherst Common and the rest probably comes from the Sunburned loft in Charlestown, Massachusetts.\nLettering by Joshua Burkett. Drawing by Chad Cooper. Album editing by Rob Thomas.\nFrom Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nAlmost as potent as Jaybird, Wildanimal boasts forth Sunburned Hand Of The Man's ability to really stretch your mind like putty until you are able to perceive the sounds they create. There are some eastern influences on the first track, with raga-esque fake sitar sounds and throat singing (behind a wall of reverb of course). These guys must take some really crazy shit to make this stuff. Some of these songs remind me of the very obscure japanese group Brast Burn because of the repetitive motifs and mantra-like chanting. It's as psychedelic as ever, but not quite as intense as it's predecessor. It definitely put you in relaxed mode. Close your eyes, let yourself go and enjoy the ride; it'll be quite colorful!",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Geez! Sometimes the Sunburned clan can come out with something that's so completely out of left field that it'll break your legs and force you to the ground, weeping. What the fuck is this album? The first track, Read My Mind is basically scraping percussive instruments accompanied by someone chanting \"Ooga-booga\" over and over again (!!?). The rest sounds like pagan devil-worshipping music. This is by far, their craziest effort yet, even more so than A Manhunt In D. The arrangements are quite skeletal, almost nonexistent with a few strange noises to liven things up a bit once in a while. On Thin Air, you get a false upbeat dance music start before immediately evaporating into the ether. The very next track could have been a song on Pee Wee's Playhouse. Can't say I really enjoy this album much. I like strange music, but without at least a semblance of dynamics, my attention is lost.",

            "about": "From Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Zample Volume One was one crazy fucking album which was really a showcase for Sunburned Hand Of The Man's most bizarre, unadulterated, auto-destructive sound explorations. This second volume continues along the same line, with thirty-one new exercises of the most unwholesome kind. Contrary to the first volume however, these new pieces often have a certain drive which prevents them from crumbling to pieces and yes, some of these miniatures actually include a certain groove. The progression between songs feels very haphazard: some tracks sound like they are actually just a part of a longer track with a chapter cut placed for no apparent reason (Toucher) while other numbers cut to the next one just as one gets into the song's groove. All of this mess is of course crammed into an extremely lo-fi package. The insert lists this album as Manhand044 (A Taste Of Never), Manhand046 is correct according to the group's online discography.'",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\nYet another excursion into the sunburned clan's more alienating sounds, Zample Volume Three continues the series in a slightly more elegant manner. With only twelve tracks this time (compared to 31 and 23 on volumes 2 and 4 respectively), the collective have enough time to extend most of these jams into something slightly more cohesive than before (only the last few tracks are short bursts of complete barnyard weirdness). Don't be fooled however, this doesn't mean that any of these tracks make any sense, in fact, they're as fucked up as ever, but they are also relatively easier to approach. What's more, this third volume in the series beats the whole Sunburned discography put together when it comes to lo-fi sound quality. I've never heard so much hiss on an album this side of Loren Connors, it sometimes even becomes overwhelming if you lose track of the music behind it. Well worth it if you can get past the sound.'",

            "about": "from Mathieu Duval's 'My Record Collection' website:\n'Zample 4 could be considered a sister album to the third volume in the Zample series. Both were released simultaneously and, besides the number of tracks (which is almost doubled here), both are incredibly lo-fi and filled with completely mind-boggling jams and bizarre fillers that fans will either love or hate. The Zample series have always been a showcase of the group at their most chaotic, the members are renowned for being able to channel their thoughts and make sense out of extremely fucked up musical situations and this comes through at times even on this album, but the music here is often so repetitive or muddled that one couldn't be blamed for dismissing this album as simply leftover bits and pieces from longer jams (which it most probably is). It's all hit-or-miss, with some moments of pure brilliance hidden within the muck. Give it a few listens and soon enough you'll find the diamonds in the rough. Limited as always.'",
