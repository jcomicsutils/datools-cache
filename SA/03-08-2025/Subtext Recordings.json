            "about": "As part of Subtext's 20th anniversary, Subtext presents the debut album from bela as a co-release with Unsound.\nbela was based in Seoul when they began to develop the framework for 'Noise and Cries (굉음과 울음)'. Chewed up by a society that's slow to embrace those who exist on the margins, they and their close friends became fixated on the concept of death. \"I wanted to cry, I wanted to die,\" they recall. \"The precariousness of living in South Korea hits different. I thought, let's share what is killing us.\" bela refused to lose hope, so they inventoried the sounds, experiences and emotions that had formulated their identity and wondered how this might form a different sort of South Korean musical expression. They considered the guttural death metal growls and industrial music they heard when they began to interface with Western culture as a a teenager, the idiosyncratic folk rhythms that rattled away in the background of state events, the evocative, euphoric drones that had offered them solace, and the heady, cybernetic maximalism that's come to define contemporary queer club music.\nIf this was going to be an album about death, bela knew couldn't it be preoccupied with loss, but rooted in a deep desire to regain the will to live.\n'Noise and Cries (굉음과 울음)' is the first time bela has recorded their voice, and they metamorphose it from moment to moment, embracing a precarious vulnerability. Opener 'The Sage' references Jungtaryeong, two well-known arias from the Korean pansori tradition - a folk form that is usually performed by a drummer and a singer. Screaming, whispering and rasping, bela twists borrowed words from the original arias, repurposing them to highlight the hypocrisy and brutality of patriarchal wisdom.\nThese bellowed phrases contrast with an abrasive rhythm that bela based on the eotmori jangdan, an irregular, traditional beat that's been remolded into a jerky, electro-acoustic call to action. Even if the gargled Korean wordplay can't be fully understood, the mood translates flawlessly. On 'Deathwill I', they reassemble the damaged relationship between a queer child and their parents with random, ghostly calls that shift between our world and the afterlife, while on '풀이' (puri, meaning unwinding), they reach to the clouds, cooing angelically and untangling the painful knots that bind them to the earthly plain's suffering.\nThe shadow of their new home Berlin can be perceived clearly on '나락' (narak, meaning pit), when bela croaks over a pounding, Berghain-ready thud. Surprisingly, they wrote the track when they were still in Seoul; it was the first they prepped for the album, and they see it as a riot song that confronts the deceptiveness of Korean society. The languidly peaceful, classist capitalism we visualize on the surface is more threatening than it might seem, and bela draws parallels with monied club tourists in Europe, lost in hedonism and ignoring the turmoil that surrounds them. They split their pneumatic beat with elements of hwimori and dongsalpuri, two more traditional rhythms, and use these elements to anchor words that deconstruct the reality of the narak - the infinite abyss in the Buddhist worldview. To bela, this place or state of despair is too familiar, so they scream at the void, highlighting the unrealistic expectations placed on young, working class Koreans in the face of widespread societal conservatism.\nBy weaving together such divergent elements, the album offers a remarkably complex picture of not just death, but rebirth. 'Noise and Cries (굉음과 울음)' is an unflinching examination of South Korea's cultural evolution, and despite its concept, it's overwhelmingly positive. bela fantasizes about what life could offer for a queer Korean, and how the country's traditions might provide tools for insight and self-discovery when wrestled away from reactionary gatekeepers. They operate between binaries, alloying high and low culture, ancient and contemporary ideas, loud and quiet, harmony and dissonance, leaving just as many questions as answers. \"Ego melts away,\" they assure. \"It's not me - we.”",

            "about": "The seed of Ego Death was planted in 2020 during Weavings—a durational remote improvisation conceived and curated by Nicolás Jaar and the Unsound Festival team. This bold experiment brought together 12 musicians from around the world in real time via Zoom, and marked the first collaboration between Resina and Aho Ssan. Their intuitive musical synergy was immediate, revealing a shared vocabulary despite working with radically different tools and instruments.\nThat moment became the beginning of an evolving creative partnership. In 2021, Resina contributed to Rhizomes, Aho Ssan’s album inspired by the philosophy of Deleuze and Guattari. The duo later reunited for alive version of Weavings to wide critical acclaim, before premiering their collaborative project Ego Death at Unsound Kraków in 2022. Their debut album will be released via Berlin-based Subtext Recordings in early Summer of 2025.\nAcross the album’s eight chapters, a wordless narrative unfolds–one of dissolution and reassembly, revealing music’s profound capacity as a language of emotion, subjectivity, and spirituality. Their music brims with dark, cinematic intensity, stretching the tonality of the cello to its breaking point and exploring the textures left in its wake. Crackling noise, field recordings, and expansive synthesis shape their compositions, bringing a dynamic and ever-shifting sonic terrain.\nThe transfer of consciousness from the human body to an electronic medium can be understood as a conversion of purely electrical impulses—signals originating in the brain and transmitted into another kind of electronic system, one that might be more accessible to others.\nA familiar question arises: do we lose any kind of knowledge in that transformation? Or does the process actually open something up—allowing for a loosening of control over the creative flow, an invitation to surrender total authority, to embrace attentiveness and openness, and above all: to dissolve boundaries?\nThis may become especially meaningful when the act of creation is no longer solitary, and no longer only for oneself. In a world driven by serotonin and dopamine loops, demanding constant productivity and performance, stepping off the path of ego can feel like a relief—even a form of resilience, or spiritual resistance.\nResina is the alias of Warsaw-based cellist and composer Karolina Rec. Since signing to FatCat/130701, she has released three solo albums: Resina (2016), Traces (2018), and Speechless (2021), a choral work for 24 voices. Her EP Traces Remixed features reworks by Ben Frost, Abul Mogard, Lotic, and Ian William Craig—artists known for pushing the boundaries of electronic and experimental music. Resina’s solo work blends processed cello, voice, and electronics, moving between ambient, noise, heavy percussion, and minimalist structures. She frequently collaborates across disciplines, composing for film, theatre, and games. Her music balances the tension between the biological and the synthetic, the intimate and the extreme, carving out a space where classical forms unravel into unclassifiable emotional landscapes.\nAho Ssan is the artist name of Paris-based Niamké Désiré. After a background in graphic design and cinema, he began creating digital instruments and composing electronic music. His debut LP Simulacrum, released by Subtext, navigated ideas of false inclusivity and identity in modern society, drawing on the theories of Jean Baudrillard and his own experience of growing up Black in France. He’s collaborated with IRCAM and won the France Télévisions award for his film music. His follow-up album Rhizomes explored the complexity and fragmentation of posthuman identity through modular synthesis and collaboration. With Ego Death, he further expands that vision, entering a profound dialogue with acoustic sound and shared authorship.",

            "about": "Subtext presents “Simulacrum”, the debut LP from\nParis-based Aho Ssan, or Désiré Niamké.\nInspired in part by French sociologist Jean Baudrillard’s\ninfluential text “Simulacres et Simulation,” the record\nplays with synthesis and simulation, picking apart notions\nof modulatable, subjective veneers of reality. Informed by\nhis experiences growing up while black in the French\nsuburbs, Niamké, turns a critical gaze towards facades\nof inclusivity and equality, and how they diverge from\nlived experiences of discrimination and racism in\nFrance.\nSonically, “Simulacrum” departs from ventures through\nSun Ra and Afrofuturist music, as Aho Ssan dreams up\nnew journeys and visions. Wanting to collaborate with a\njazz musician but unable to find one, he turned to\nbuilding patches in Max/MSP to create simulations of\nthem. The Mensah Imaginary Band features on tracks\n“Blind Power” and “We Don’t Have to Worry Anymore.”\nTaking shape across Max objects and patch cables, the\nensemble takes its name from Niamké’s trumpet player\ngrandfather Mensah Antony, who led a Ghanaian band in\nIvory Coast in the 1950s and acted as a conductor at the\ncountry’s famed Abissa Festival.\nAho Ssan, who never met Antony and has no access\nto recordings or information about his musical career,\nspeculates on his musical heritage.\nAho Ssan debuted “Simulacrum” at Berlin Atonal\n2019. After studying graphic design and cinema, he\nstarted composing electronic music and creating his\nown digital instruments. Shortly thereafter Niamké\nwent on to win the Foundation France television\nprize for his soundtrack to the 2015 film “D’Ingha\nMago,” and has since worked on several projects\naffiliated with IRCAM.",

            "about": "Alexander Tucker has announced details of a new album, Fifth Continent, a posthumous collaboration with Keith Collins (1966-2018).\nThe album, which pays homage to Keith Collins, his partner and collaborator Derek Jarman (1942-1994), and the Kentish headland, Dungeness – will be released on Subtext Recordings on February 24th, 2023.\nAn accompanying anthology, Fifth Quarter, will be published on the same day. The book will collate new and archive work by artists, photographers and writers reflecting on Collins, Jarman, one of England’s most unique landscapes, Dungeness and Prospect Cottage, their former home and sanctuary.\nThe first single 'In Smiling In Slow Motion' directly confronts Collins' reflections on Jarman and his work. Collins' voice is subtly mutated by Tucker's delicate granular processes, taking centre stage in front of environmental recordings and a poignant ticking clock, recorded in Prospect Cottage.\nThe album’s genesis came from a chance meeting in Dungeness. Tucker was visiting his parents, who moved there in 1997, and while out beachcombing he met Collins and the two became friends. Tucker was already a fan of the work of the British artist, activist and filmmaker Derek Jarman, having been alerted to him by an art teacher at school, and Collins would invite Tucker to Prospect Cottage. Over time casual chats between Collins and Tucker developed into bigger ideas. In 2014, the two collaborated on ‘Between The Ears: More Than A Desert’ for the BBC, splicing guitar improvisations Tucker recorded on the beach in Dungeness with Collins' readings from Jarman's ‘Modern Nature’, and Collins and Tucker talked about collaborating further at a later date.\nSadly in 2018 Collins was diagnosed with a malignant brain tumour. Whilst in hospital he asked Tucker to look after his vast music collection kept in Prospect Cottage, tasking him with cleaning up and pruning the many CDs. After Collins passed away Tucker would travel down to Dungeness, helping Collins’ husband Garry Clayton with the Cottage. Tucker mentioned to Clayton his idea for making a homage to Collins, and he suggested Tucker bring down recording equipment. A few weeks later Tucker set up a modular system, cello, microphones and electronics in Jarman’s old writing room, the Spring room.\nClayton also lent a digital recorder to Tucker belonging to Collins, containing spoken word pieces and fielding recordings. \"It was strange collaborating with someone who wasn't there anymore,\" he admits. “But I had this idea of knitting Keith’s recordings into the track, not just to play alongside them but to integrate him into the fabric of the music”. Tucker had the idea to attempt a whole record using only extended and concrète techniques, with Collins' recordings as the springboard for a more wide-ranging set of experiments, some featuring the improvised trumpet drones and pulsing electronics of the artist and musician Kenichi Iwasa (Exotic Sin, Maxwell Sterling).\nComplex emotions are tied into the recordings, the words and sounds Collins recorded to his portable field recorder, and the instrumental improvisations Tucker made in Prospect Cottage. Each sound on the record leads towards its deeply moving finale, where we hear a ticking clock once more, and Collins talks about coming to terms with Jarman's death. Accompanied by Tucker's restrained instrumental flourishes, it's a piece of sound that's unabashedly moving, and one that will stick in your mind long after it's come to a close.\nFifth Continent is accompanied by a new anthology, Fifth Quarter: Derek Jarman, Keith Collins and Dungeness, edited and complied by Tucker and published by Subtext. This book brings together Jarman and Collins’ collaborators, friends, contemporary artists, writers, musicians and curators. Focusing not only on Jarman’s legacy but drawing influence from the layers of history and inspiration from the Dungeness and Romney Marsh landscape. Fifth Quarter seeks to merge the past with the present, using archive photography and film stills, alongside newly commissioned artworks and writing, encompassing Jarman’s collaborations with Collins and his circle of friends and colleagues, with collaboration being central theme to Jarman’s polymathic work and life.\nContributors (in alphabetical order):\nBarry Adamson, Jennifer Lucy Allan, Sarah Badr, Derek Brown, Keith Collins, Garry Clayton, Peter Fillingham, William Fowler, Dan Fox, Elise Lammer, Matthew R Lewis, James Mackay, Frances Morgan, Garrett Nelson, Stephen O’Malley, Paul Purgas, Damien Roach, Howard Sooley, Mark Titchner, Alexander Tucker, Peter Tucker, Luke Turner, Simon Fisher Turner, and Cosey Fanni Tutti.",

            "about": "With simple materials found in hardware stores—such as PVC pipes, water hoses, and ball valves—powered by a construction site air compressor, mesmerizing drones emerge, challenging our expectations of the material.\nOriginally inspired by foghorns and sirens, Amina set out to gain control over these sounds by building a foghorn organ. However, what emerged from this experiment was something far beyond foghorns: a hauntingly electronic-sounding acoustic instrument, spreading frequencies like lasers, which Amina has come to call her sound crystals. These sound crystals translate surprisingly well to recording and are best enjoyed through speakers.\nOriginally conceived during a residency at Skogen in Gothenburg, ātamōn is the result of a personal and spiritual exploration. Drawing from years of conversations with a spiritual advisor and therapeutic work on inner archetypes, Amina transforms composition into a tool for self-inquiry. The piece centers around a deconstructed version of the foghorn organ, with eight pipes placed throughout the room—each representing a distinct psychological archetype, such as The Safe Place, Hyperarousal, or Original Face.\nThe title ātamōn, derived from Old High German meaning “to breathe,” reflects the instrument as a living, communicating organism. With pipes instead of actors and sound in place of speech, the composition unfolds like a wordless theatre, where frequencies act out the tensions, longings, and contradictions of human experience.\nRecorded later in the vast, reverberant space of Spelhuset at Ställbergs gruva—an out-of-use iron mine in rural Sweden—ātamōn becomes a sonic ritual: an encounter between body, resonance, and the infinite. The space itself, once housing the massive wheels for the mine's elevator, amplifies the work, as each sound lingers, refracts, and folds back into itself.\nIn ātamōn I, we hear the play unfolding as the different parts communicate and test each other. Each archetype believes it serves a purpose, even when its effect is painful. The work gives these parts space to speak, ultimately bringing them into harmony—not to villainize them, but to listen.\nIn ātamōn II, the space itself speaks with the instrument. Moving through the sound field with microphones, Amina activates the acoustic properties of the old chamber. Each gesture becomes an invitation for the mine to respond, as the sound draws from the resonance of the place.\nThe result is drone-based music where sonic textures emerge slowly, yet are punctuated by moments of sudden intensity—alarm-like signals and interlocking polyrhythms that pierce through the density like flashes of insight. Elsewhere, the sound becomes vast and oceanic, inviting the listener to drift through a continuously shifting field of resonance.\nInformed by inner inquiry, symbolic systems, spiritual science, and the re-enchantment of sound, ātamōn constructs a delicate architecture of vibration—a memory not of events, but of presence. Rather than telling a story, the work opens a space for listening, sensing, and transformation.\nAlongside the release, a book by Amina Hocine and Jennifer Lucy Allan further extends the work in text, mapping its inner contours and sonic logic.",

            "about": "Başak Günak is a Istanbul-born, Berlin-based sound artist and composer, also internationally known as AH! KOSMOS in the field of electronic music. Her work includes sound art, performance, sound installation, composition for theater and contemporary dance.\nIn her forthcoming solo album Rewilding, Başak Günak has worked with the themes of (auto-)rewilding, foraging and decay, while also incorporating sounds she has gathered from her sound art and sound installations. “Rewilding” embodies the sounds of whistles, whispers, a deconstruction of a South-Eastern Anatolian folk song and the instruments; organ, bass clarinet, halldrophone, Buchla 100 and a broken piano. As foraging does not require territorial exclusivity, Başak Günak weaves together three songs from her sound installations presented in 2020 and 2023.\nWhile reimaging whispers, whistles, murmurs and sine waves as the auto-rewilders of the soundscape of the album, Günak creates a soft and porous medium that later disappears into the swamp. Sometimes these whistles take the form of a distant sound of a murmur that tends to disappear and then reaches to the surface again and overflows into audibility.\nAbout the artist:\nBaşak Günak released two solo LPs from Compost Records & Denovali Records, two collaborative LPs with and numerous EPs. Her album‘Beautiful Swamp’ was listed as Best Albums of 2018 by Deutschlandfunk Kultur and ‘Bluets’ was selected by Byte.FM as Best Albums of 2022 and. Both timeless and otherworldly, Günak’s work unconsciously taps into something beyond an immediate surrounding or experience, reaching for the transcendental. Günak uses audio test equipment, acoustic instruments and found sounds to build her own sonic realm in which to interrogate the mystical and metaphysical implications of sound.\nIn addition to her musical compositions as AH! KOSMOS, Günak pursues her sound experimentations as a sound artist, composing for theatre, contemporary dance, film and visual art projects, and realising site-specific performances. Her works have been featured worldwide in several festivals and institutions, such as Barbican Theatre (UK), Martin-Gropius Bau(DE), Royal Theater Carré (NL), Sonar Festival (SP), Berlin CTM Festival (DE), Rotterdamse Schouwburg (NL) and Prague Quadrennial (CZ). In 2020, she presented her latest solo sound installation THE WELL, a piece for 11 speakers and performance in VKV Museum Istanbul.\nRecently, she has contributed composition for Martin-Gropius Bau, Berlin State Museums, Kunstmuseum Basel, Your Data Mirror which was awarded for 2 Webby Awards in Activism. She is invited to residencies in Elektronmusikstudion Stockholm, HELLERAU Center For European Arts and to Bijloke Academy to realize her piece in hybrid format “Flesh is a flesh is a flesh\".\nahkosmos.com\nahkosmos.bandcamp.com\nbasakgunak.bandcamp.com\ninstagram.com/ahkosmos",

            "about": "Bridget Ferrill & Áslaug Magnúsdóttir’s EP revels in the joy of complexity. A first collaborative release from the long-distance duo, Woodwind Quintet is an exercise in contrasts that quivers with electric pulses and patches. They crack, split, and weave through intricately embroidered classical elements in intimate and unexpected arrangements. Sonic fragments and scrambled instrumentation are disrupted by signal noise and rapid tempo shifts. Illogical compositions lead the listener along a dynamic meditation on beauty in alienation.\nUS-born Ferrill first met Icelandic Magnúsdóttir in Reykjavík in 2014. Originally from New Hampshire (by way of Rhode Island), the composer, synth-builder and engineer spent a few years living on-and-off in the breathtaking isolation of the Nordic country before settling in Berlin. Meanwhile, Magnúsdóttir is perhaps best-known for her work with ambient folk trio Samaris. Now living in Copenhagen, her focus on creating different experiences on traditional forms extends beyond performing music outside of conventional spaces but approaching instruments as sculptures. The two artists reconnected in 2018 on a serendipitous train ride after parallel tours of Oslo, Norway, and have been working together ever since.\nApplying an irreverent approach to their shared academic backgrounds, Ferrill and Magnúsdóttir realised their first collaboration in the musty, damp interior of an empty water tank only accessible through a small opening. The metallic reverb and stormy dissonance of their “Silkworm + Sluxzxx” performance debuted as part of Seyðisfjörður’s LungA residency in 2019, with both artists pacing the dirt floor of the enormous cylindrical structure, a supernal vocal sample pushing against the noisy tumult.\nFor Woodwind Quintet, there’s more clarity, if as much interference with its equal parts discordant and melodious tangle of guitar pedals, YouTube clips and Ableton presets, modular synths and MIDI patches. There’s the digital string hardware instrument called the Karper, made by synth designer Peter Blasser, and samples from friend and colleague Liam Byrne’s viola da gamba. The harp, banjo and often-heavily processed vocals are the artists’ own, most likely recorded in Ferrill’s tiny apartment in south-east Berlin during one Magnúsdóttir’s regular visits.\nInterested in taking traditional material and deconstructing its form, Ferrill and Magnúsdóttir dabble in interruption and structure with a chaotic but always intentional and precise method. “We cared a lot about timing,” explains Ferrill. “Getting all the sounds perfectly puzzled together.”\nThe opening strings of “Gossip” are scrambled, scratched, and broken apart before being brought back into harmony by delicate piano keys. “Eternal Liquid Sad” expresses a powerful feeling of melancholy with humour, as its leading legato is sped up, jumbled, and reversed through an undertow of deep bass. It’s a sense of subtle enormity that carries into the gloomier, low-pitched orchestration of “Tapestry”, as a kick and syncopated hi-hat occasionally harries alongside.\nAs if to foreground these sonic punchlines, the astonishingly beautiful cover image—photographed by Byrne with a hacked digital camera—is a modern take on an old still life. A zither ruined by concrete is submerged in a tepid pool of bathwater, in what could be either a baptism or a drowning of an ancient instrument in a present-day tub.",

            "about": "Ahead of his representing Turkey at this year’s Venice Biennale, Subtext present’s Istanbul based Cevdet Erek’s first full length LP: ‘Davul’. The title refers to the instrument performed by Erek, a large drum with many names, common from Eastern Europe to the Middle East, known variably as a daouli (Greek), tapan (Macedonian), dahol (Kurdish), or tabl (Arabic) to cite a few.\nErek plays the drum with his own unusual method, utilising a large soft mallet alongside various smaller implements to beat and distort the skin of the drum, tuned lower than normal, taking advantage of being able to walk around studio or installation spaces with the instrument. Erek acquired the drum from a Roma musician, proceeding to play it in private for years where he developed this new textural approach, integrating the instrument into his A Room of Rhythms installation piece at Istanbul Biennial, 2015.\nComprising extracts culled from hours of solo drum improvisations recorded over two days in Berlin, ‘Davul’ features no editing or overdubbing. At times Erek describes “playing to get the negative and aggressive away from inside of me, hoping that I could do the same for the other people surrounding me.” He refers to a shamanic history of healing rituals - although the davul is most commonly used for weddings, dances, and celebrations. “Of course the aesthetics of dark electronics and noise that I've been exposed to for decades informs the overall feel as well,” adds Erek.\nOver seven improvised pieces Erek conjures a massive variety of\nuncharacteristic sounds and colours from the drum, from deep\nscrapes and grinds to heavy rubs and drones, creating complex\nrhythms. Experimentation with rhythm, meter, and silence has\nalways been at the core of what Erek does - from his work as a conceptual artist, presenting work at the likes of dOCUMENTA, to decades as the drummer in Turkish experimental rock band Nekropsi - but ‘Davul’ is his purest statement-of-intent to date; a raw and hypnotic exploration of flow and dynamics.\nBio: Cevdet Erek was born in Istanbul in 1974, where he would initially study Architecture. Originally formed in 1989, Erek has also been the longtime drummer with Turkish experimental music stalwarts, Nekropsi. After completing his Masters in Sound Engineering & Design at İTÜ MIAM Center for Advanced Studies in Music, Erek’s installations and performances have been presented far and wide, including dOCUMENTA, Sydney Biennial, and Istanbul Modern. He’s also worked on sound and music for film, most recently contributing original music and sound design to Emin Alper’s “Frenzy” (Venice International Film Festival – Special Jury Prize, 2015).",

It takes its cue from the small ball chain fixed at the rim of one of the skins of the double-skinned drum. The performance in this recording is solely based on the dialogue between the bass skin that’s hit by a mallet and the other skin which is continuously moving in sympathy with it. The drum is rotated into different positions in order to control or liberate the movement of the chain in response to the second drum skin.\nSince the 2017 Subtext release of Erek’s album “Davul” a series of performances occurred in contexts such as Berghain as part of CTM festival, in Hamburger Bahnhof Museum as part of Cevdet’s 2020 solo show “Bergama Stereo,” an ancient stadium amongst Messene in Greece’s Peloponnese region and underground venues in Istanbul. This recording was originally commissioned by Outernational for a concert that was supposed to take place in Berlin’s Radial System December 15th, 2020. The concert was cancelled due to the pandemic and the plan changed, becoming a streamed concert with pre-filmed and recorded performances.\nCevdet was commissioned to do a 6-8 minute piece but kept on playing for almost a half hour.\nThis performance that comprises Zincirli happened in the context of lockdown in Istanbul, while he and family were caring for his mother and mourning the loss of his father.\nObserving how amongst the succession of indistinguishable days and nights his life force reacted to the repetition of routines and gestures, Cevdet sees parallels in how the small changes in the rotation of the drum amongst a regular beat created macroscopic changes of emotional expression while performing.\nZincirli is a study on moving in confined space while being fixed from one side to an essential and vital location.",

The concert was cancelled due to the pandemic and the plan changed, becoming a streamed concert with pre-filmed and recorded performances.\nCevdet was commissioned to do a 6-8 minute piece but kept on playing for almost a half hour.\nThis performance that comprises Zincirli happened in the context of lockdown in Istanbul, while he and family were caring for his mother and mourning the loss of his father.\nObserving how amongst the succession of indistinguishable days and nights his life force reacted to the repetition of routines and gestures, Cevdet sees parallels in how the small changes in the rotation of the drum amongst a regular beat created macroscopic changes of emotional expression while performing.\nZincirli is a study on moving in confined space while being fixed from one side to an essential and vital location.",

            "about": "Berlin based electronic musician and cellist Chloe Lula presents the LP Oneiris.\nHaving studied the cello at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and attended music schools up until the age of 18, Chloe gave up her ultra-strict regime of classical training, realising that she saw no future in it for herself — instead immersing herself in community radio, experimental music and techno. Chloe went on to tour the world as a techno DJ and producer, while working as a music journalist in parallel.\nIt was through journalism that Chloe had the opportunity to meet and interview artists like Hildur Guðnadóttir, Max Richter and Yair Elazar Glotman. Inspired by the possibility of exploring approaches informed by electronic and electro acoustic music, and missing the tactile experience and intimacy of instruments, she felt herself drawn back to her formative instrument.\nFor Chloe, there was an intuitive, associative, dream logic to going back to the cello. It became a totem for the things that exist beyond the periphery of her conscious mind and memory — a bridge between the past and the present, and a conduit for half-forgotten memories and emotions. This was a process that became mirrored in a desire to reconnect with exploring natural environments as a counterpoint to the architecture of clubs and electronic music.\nFor Chloe, as for many people, discovering electronic music represented the possibility of total immersion in another world of iconoclastic possibilities, and with that a rejection of her past. Focusing on the cello as the primary instrument in her musical practice has forced a confrontation with all that she left behind. To reject something is inevitably to be haunted by it, and this record represents both a confrontation with the haunting quality of the past, and a celebration of the feedback loops of inspiration that moving between musical forms and contexts can catalyse.",

            "about": "Koenraad Ecker and Frederik Meulyzer make their Subtext debut with \"Carbon\".\nBased on field recordings made at Norway’s Svalbard Global Seed Vault, a secure seed bank located on the island of Spitsbergen, Carbon grapples with the many contradictions that lie at the heart of our shift into the capitalocene.\nThe project began in 2017, when Ecker and Meulyzer scored the performance “Frozen Songs,” a commission by Zero Visibility Dance Company led by Ina Christel Johannessen.\nThe Svalbard Global Seed Vault was conceived of as an effort to preserve copies of seeds from key crop varieties, ensuring their persistence in the event of large-scale crises. Yet the area is warming faster than anywhere else on earth, causing the permafrost to melt and putting the seed vault at risk.\nAcross from the Seed Vault lie the decrepit remnants of Svalbard’s mining activities of the early 20th century; Carbon wrestles with the incongruities nestled in the town’s landscape. Reflecting on dissonances of stasis and change, closeness and distance, enclosure and expanse, as well as cynicism and hope, Ecker and Meulyzer consider the urgency of our situation while trying to sidestep all-too popular depictions of dystopia. In Ecker’s own words, “we don’t have the luxury to afford that kind of pessimism.”\nFrom close, supple sounds to cold, brutal sonics, Carbon meditates on the many challenging questions and contradictions raised by the Seed Vault and its surroundings—a landscape that embodies and makes visible the many intertwined phenomena that shape our current predicament.\nEcker and Meulyzer, formerly known as Stray Dogs, have released works such as Wasteland, recorded in deconsecrated church in Antwerp, and Kalkar, recorded in the cooling tower of a former power station in Germany.\nKoenraad Ecker works in the fields of electro-acoustic music, field recording, radio plays, stage performance and text. Together with Andrea Taeggi, he is part of the Opal Tapes-affiliated duo Lumisokea. His output encompasses studio albums, audiovisual installations, texts, performances, and sound design for film.\nFrederik Meulyzer is a percussionist active in projects including Belgian jazz band Hamster Axis of the One-Click Panther, contemporary music and theatre company Post uit Hessdalen, and experimental psych-krautrock band Slumberland.",

            "about": "With ‘CHORDS’, the Stockholm-based musician and composer Ellen Arkbro returns to Subtext, following her acclaimed debut album ‘For Organ and Brass’.\nThis new longplayer sees Arkbro adopt a more minimalist approach, focusing on the immediate qualities of sound and elegantly expanding the tonal capacities of acoustic instruments using precise, subtle synthesis.\nComposed of a carefully selected combination of tones, ‘CHORDS’ stretches, extends and obscures the timbral character of the instruments it is performed on.\nAcross both tracks, Arkbro examines the sonic materiality and harmonic quality of chords. She considers how the compositions occupy space rather than time – transposing theoretical possibilities into the phenomenal realm.\nAs a part of Arkbro’s systematic investigation of harmonic sound, ‘CHORDS’ proffers a divergence from conventional ways of listening. This work allows for a form of listening which goes beyond the mere reception of outer stimuli in letting the listener experience their role as active, and as embodying the sound itself. Space rather than time becomes the primary locus of listening as subtle movement of head and body reveals the inner complexities of ‘CHORDS’.",

            "about": "Stockholm-based composer Ellen Arkbro's 'For Organ and Brass' is comprised of works that focus on tuning, intonation and harmonic modulation.\nThe title composition was written for an organ with a specific kind of\nhistorical tuning known as meantone temperament. It was only after locating an appropriate instrument—the Shererorgel dating back to 1624 in St. Stephen’s Church in Tangermünde, Northeastern Germany—-that Arkbro set about recording both for organ and brass and its counterpart, three.\n“Hidden within the harmonic framework of the Renaissance organ are\nintervals and chords that bare a close resemblance to those found in the modalities of traditional blues music,” explains Arkbro. “The work can be thought of as a very slow and reduced blues music.”\nThe work moves gradually through a series of long, sustained tones played by the organ and in parallel by a brass trio comprised of horn, tuba, and trombone. Arkbro’s treatment of pitch resembles the tuning strategies of La Monte Young. The brass parts were performed by brass trio Zinc & Copper.\nIn Arkbro’s words, “the brass instruments and the organ fall into patterns of interaction in which a new breathing instrument emerges.” three, which follows the 20-minute title work, deploys the same principles of harmonic relativity. In removing the organ from the instrumentation and switching to a different meter, three acts as an intimate counterpoint to the ritual drone cycles of the title piece.\nEllen Arkbro is currently studying for her Master’s degree in music\ncomposition at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. Her work has been performed in Brooklyn, Stockholm, Norberg, Bologna, Gothenburg, Berlin, Birmingham, and Malmö, and on Swedish National Radio.\n'For Organ and Brass' was recorded in Tangermünde, Germany in September 2016. The performers were Johan Graden (organ), Elena Kakaliagou (horn), Hilary Jeffery (trombone), and Robin Hayward (tuba).\nPublished by Multiverse Media Publishing\n© & ℗ Subtext / Multiverse LTD 2023\n© all rights reserved",

            "about": "emptyset present Ash — a new collection of sound experiments developed over the last three years and assembled in Bristol during summer 2023.\nThe work draws on the project's roots in structural percussion and physical sonics, employing spatialised recording techniques and an array of analogue hardware,evoking the transformative and sculptural properties of sound.\nThe release marks a return for the collaborative duo of James Ginzburg and Paul Purgas, following Ginzburg's work within the exploratory performance group Osmium and Purgas' extensive research into the history of India's first electronic music studio. It brings them back to Bristol where the project first began, channeling the echoes of the city's sound system culture and resonant musical continuum, anchoring their sound within its formative origins.\nLaunching on October 20th through Subtext Recordings as the 50th release for the label, there will be a series of live shows including Berlin Atonal on September 16th and London's Village Underground on November 5th, their first live show in the city in over a decade. emptyset will also be bringing together a special day of sound and performance across multiple venues in Bristol planned for Spring 2024.",

            "about": "Material takes the form of a triptych release documenting three site-specific installations and recordings developed by emptyset throughout winter 2012. The project spans three locations: a decommissioned nuclear power station in Snowdonia, a vast concrete testing bunker below central London and a 22 mile medieval mine tunneled into the earth beneath Kent. The recordings further the work developed through the release Medium, exploring the relationship between space and the fundamental properties of sound, applying extreme bass, noise and feedback as means of extracting the essence and sonic signature of these unique sites. Across the recordings there is a focus on the nature of sonic decay, as each space imparts its signature reverberant characteristics to the signal, ranging from detailed noise reflecting across sheer concrete surfaces to low frequency sonics tunneling through subterranean earth. Collectively the recordings provide an immersive document of these three locations, crafting a unified exploration of structure, material and sound.\nThe release is comprised of a recording from within the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station in North Wales, a former uranium reactor site currently being decommissioned, with the interior recording forming the soundtrack to a film installation for Tate Britain. Alongside this is an excerpt from a sound installation commissioned by the Architecture Foundation at Ambika P3, the former concrete testing bunker below Baker Street in London, known for extreme testing of sections of the Channel Tunnel and British motorway. Then finally there is a piece recorded within Chislehurst mine, a 22 mile tunnel network carved into the earth through chalk and flint extraction that spanned from the middle ages up to the early 1800's.\nMaterial emerges as meeting point of these three sites, providing a sonic narrative that links the locations, whilst forming a wider exploration into themes of architecture, industry and recursion.\nAll tracks written and produced by J. Ginzburg & P. Purgas\nLocation recording engineer tracks 1 & 3 - Mat Sampson\nMixed at Multiverse Bristol, UK\nPhotography by J. Ginzburg\nPublished by Multiverse Media Publishing\nSleeve Design by John Coulthart\nThanks to:\nTate Britain - Marianne Mulvey\nThe Architecture Foundation - Justin Jaeckle\nMagnox Ltd - Ian Edwards & Mark Chevis\nClayton Welham & Sam Williams\nJoanie Lemercier\nPS-\nWe accidentally uploaded a duplicate version of this album to Bandcamp.

            "about": "Recur is presented as emptyset’s third studio album, continuing on from their work with Demiurge the material examines the central themes of time, structure and recursion, through the analysis of scale and the interaction of both formal and fractured sonics. The album furthers the project’s exploration of rhythm, dislocation and feedback within the framework of full frequency sound, structural abstraction and analogue processing. The work examines how notions of time interact with both experience and form, and the resulting modes through which this affects sound through compression and rarefaction and the forcing of signal thresholds to their critical point.",

            "about": "Subtext presents Barotrauma by Eric Holm. The source material for Barotrauma was recorded in the\nNordic fjords south of Oslo, an adjunct to Eric Holm’s training at the Norwegian School of Commercial diving (Norsk Yrkesdykkerskole). While he was training world oil prices collapsed, so left with an uncertain future Holm decided to record and film his dives, capturing the lonely calm of his isolation in the dark water.\nLike environments on land, the seabed is populated with machines, industry, and noise. Interference is everywhere. Engines, equipment, drilling: it is a mirror of on-land environmental exploitation.\nThese six tracks were created over the last two years, using the sounds Holm collected from the sea floor and subsea equipment, which he then manipulated and processed, shaping a vision of his time in this underwater environment.",

            "about": "Eric Holm's new album reflects on his time spent underwater in the face of a growingly precarious personal, ecological and political landscape. A series of field recordings captured both above and below the surface are reformed into a sonic palette. Via oceanic sounds and rhythms taken from mechanical diving apparatuses, Surface Variations meditates on the connectivities and dissonances between humanity and nature.\nSubmerged within a marine panorama, the material frames the interplays of darkness and light — the contrasting of lively ecosystems and vast emptiness — contemplating the bloodlike essence of the planet and the eternal mysteries the oceans harbour.\nThe compositions draw on Holm’s time as an industrial diver, reflecting on ongoing desires to conquer this untameable domain, and a deeper humility in comprehending the limits and fragility of humans in the face of the unstoppable forces of nature.\nPerceiving the ocean itself as both a teacher and a mirror, the music emerges as meditations on the human condition, seeking to imagine through the silence and solitude of water the possibility of alternative currents for life above ground.\nDrifting alone, the sea becomes a timeless space for contemplation, a place to dream of new futures whilst reconciling the flotsam of the past.\nEric Holm in a UK based, America born sound artist and composer. His first LP Andøya (2014) was made from contact mic recordings of pylons carrying communications cables that connected listening stations on an Arctic Norwegian island. Eric's second LP Barotrauma (2016) was recorded underwater while training to be an industrial diver.",

            "about": "Natural patterns of organic life make the most efficient use of space and surface area and in permaculture design one observes natural patterns in a landscape and plans details accordingly. Taking a self-occurring pattern like the veins of a leaf, contour lines, or the spirals of water and letting that guide interactions with the surface of the earth. The ethos is to work with natural flow and processes rather than to impose.\nMirroring this idea From Patterns to Details draws from the sense of a deeper underlying order. It sees continuity between environment and individual, continuity between external bodies and the internal emotional landscapes that music can communicate beyond the affordances of language. The album embraces technology as something that is not in conflict with the organic processes of nature. Technology is treated as life in a different state. Human beings are gardens in a different state; all temporary forms of the same thing. From Patterns to Details imagines states of alignment with all, and harmonious design, a complete integration between personal and external systems whether organic or technological.\nFis composes physical, spirited, exploratory electronic music inspired in part by his work as a permaculture designer. Initially developing his craft on the sound systems of his birth country New Zealand, he went on to a string of critically acclaimed releases on Tri Angle Records and Loopy in recent years.",

            "about": "Subtext presents Clear Stones, the first meeting between two distinct voices from New Zealand. In a unique collaboration, Māori sound artist Rob Thorne (Ngāti Tumutumu) and Berlin-based electronic composer Fis dismantle boundaries in space, time, and genre, juxtaposing Thorne’s living, breathing practice with the weight of modern sound systems.\nRecording sessions at Berlin’s Red Bull Studios were the starting point, committing Thorne’s traditional Māori instrumentation to tape. Made of wood, stone, bone and shell, the instruments of taonga pūoro (translating to ‘singing treasures’) include various oblique-style flutes, horns, percussion, and objects spun above the player’s head during performance. Amongst the instrumentation deployed by Thorne on Clear Stonesis the Pūtātara (conch horn), Pūrerehua (bullroarer), and TumutumuKōhatu (stone percussion). However it’s the Pūtōrino that features most regularly throughout; an instrument that is both flute and horn, both voices captured in one single take by Thorne on mid-album epic ‘Glurn Herrin’. Thorne has been performing in New Zealand for some 25 years, and the release of his debut solo album Whāia te Māramatangaon Rattle Records in 2014 garnered wide critical acclaim, including a nomination for ‘Best Maori Traditional Album’ at the 2014 Waiata Māori Music Awards.\nSince his debut on Tri Angle Records in 2013, Fis has released a string of acclaimed albums, including his Subtext debut From Patterns to Details in 2016, ending up in end-of-year lists at both FACT magazine and The Quietus. Starting with Thorne’s taonga pūoro recordings, Fis sculpts bold new settings for the music, mired in deep bass and vast synthetic tones, at times pushing Thorne’s wood, stone, and bone into total transformative saturation. The conversation that emerges between these two artists encompasses technology and nature, computers and physical instruments, historical narrative and the present, perceived secularity and sacredness, framing them all as aspects of one single, conscious whole.\nFis and Rob Thorne will be touring Europe in lead up to the release, starting with Borderline Festival in Athens, going on to open Milan’s outernational Mondo Muzak festival, plus make a visit to Cafe Oto in London.",

            "about": "Continuing Subtext’s exploratory electronics and devastating sonics is the expansive Ego De Espinhos, the debut full-length from twenty-two year old Porto, Portugal-based artist Gonçalo Penas.\nDescribed by Penas as a series of “self-exorcisms,” Ego De Espinhos is the cathartic outcome of a highly introspective process. Shaped by opposing forces and instincts, the LP touches on themes that are at once intimate, yet omnipresent. Splendor confronts destruction; id confronts super-ego.\nCreated solely with digital instruments designed and built by the artist, Ego De Espinhos is the result of Penas’ improvisations. Tracks such as “Introdução, Umbigo” and “Tecto Falso” were recorded in one take, and evidence a stark, dramatic emotional palette.\nThe release begins as Penas chooses to reject rigidities, customs and conventions of experimental electronic music. Of his process, Penas says: “Personally, I feel that creation should come from a completely free act of will. It is a place where there should be no rules, no expectations, no rights and no wrongs.”\nIn Ego De Espinhos, Penas turns away from his own technical background, and towards a journey of forward experimentation. This follows his education in Music Production and Technologies at Porto’s School of Music and Performing Arts. For the first time, he finds the freedom to articulate himself sincerely, unearthing beauty and acceptance amidst wreckage and devastation.",

            "about": "Holly Childs & Gediminas Žygus’s Gnarled Roots is the follow up to Hydrangea, released in 2020, the next in a series of works exploring and deconstructing aspects of the cinematic, politics, and fiction.\nThe intercontinental collaboration began in a series of presentations shown across Europe and Australia. This latest iteration was seeded in site-specific performance “Hydrangea 2: Gnarled Roots of a Creation Theory” – a reference to the fabled PhD thesis by an Australian businessman claiming to be anonymous Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto. Twenty-first century mythology is at the centre of the album’s broad and complex narrative, with the September 11 Twin Tower attacks its origin story.\n“We started working on Gnarled Roots through doing a lot of research on 9/11 and our experience of it,” says Žygus. “Looking at it as this cataclysmic, highly theatrical event that has had an effect on many of the narratives of the world since.”\nThe most explicit allusion to the 2001 global incident is on “Turns to Dust”. Lurching bass distortion and an uncanny harp melody buffets Elif Satanaya Özbay’s query, “Where did the buildings go?” with reference to mechanical engineer and 9/11 conspiracy theorist Judy Wood. The droning of album opener “Two Trees”, takes New York’s World Trade Center as a point of departure into exploring binaries and duplication, puzzles and paradoxes, collapse and destruction.\nThe other voices on Gnarled Roots also include Marijn Degenaar, Mark Prendergast, and Stephanie Overs, most of whom resume their roles in the expanding narrative of 2020’s Hydrangea. They come to inhabit the same space across creative dimensions. “The forest in Gnarled Roots is increasing in complexity the longer it grows,” says Childs. “In Hydrangea, there wasn’t even a forest yet, just some hydrangea bushes in a void.”\n“Through our research we got to a more general topic of doubles and twins,” says Childs. “Belief and Knowledge are twin characters, representing twin information forms or modes of understanding the world.”\nGnarled Roots explores contradiction, and junctures at which manifold options are presented, but where no clearly preferable path exists. Ongoing collaborators Metahaven have designed assorted album covers for multiple platforms, while the composite branching of reality is notably explored on “Forking”. Özbay’s persona, Belief, describes coming to a fork in a road: “Do you choose option A or option B?” This is an echo of the use of the hydrangea—a flower that blooms either blue or pink, depending on the composition of the soil in which it grows—on Childs and Žygus’s titular first album. It’s a symbol of the latent possibilities contained within each scenario and material.\nThis expansive, interdisciplinary project is defined by its relationship to cinema, as much as by its relationship to music. Žygus’s production mirrors video editing techniques and film theory. The materials used include an industry standard orchestral sound library for film scores and a software synth made in the Dutch gabber community, composed and arranged to moving-image clips ranging from Pride and Prejudice to K-pop music videos. Psychedelic folk, club-adjacent chamber music, post-classical and sci-fi all bleed into the sonic environments of Gnarled Roots.\nA subterranean flipside to last year’s Hydrangea, this second release by the cross-cultural duo dives into some of the myths, fictions and fables that shape societies. “If Hydrangea was an atmosphere,” says Childs. “Gnarled Roots is the earth.”\nHolly Childs is a writer and artist in Naarm/Melbourne, Australia. Alongside Gediminas Žygus, in 2020 she released Hydrangea, an album exploring narrative fracture, reality bubbles, and intimacy. She is the author of two books: No Limit published by Hologram and Danklands published by Arcadia Missa. She is a former Associate Artist at Jacuzzi (Amsterdam), Gertrude Contemporary studio holder (Melbourne), an alumna of The New Normal at Strelka Institute (Moscow), and holds a Masters in Film, Design and Politics from Sandberg Instituut (Amsterdam).\nGediminas Žygus is a Lithuanian artist working within the fields of sound, film and performance. Their practice focuses on the experience of selfhood in the post-anthropocene. Gediminas Žygus has presented works and collaborations at Barbican Centre, Berghain, La Biennale di Venezia, HKW, The Kitchen, Centre Pompidou, Unsound and others.",

            "about": "\"Find the False Illusion and Make it Real… and Then You’re Stuck With It\"\nSubtext presents: Hydrangea, the debut album from writer and artist Holly Childs and artist Gediminas Žygus formerly known as J.G. Biberkopf.\nInitiated in 2017, Hydrangea grew out of a series of performances emphasising conspiracies and the designer realities that they generate. Navigating a tangle of digitally induced subjectivities and relationships, Hydrangea sees Childs & Žygus amidst a continuously evaporating world in which narratives dissolve, leak, fold in on themselves and loop.\nChilds & Žygus ask: As individuals are siloed online, can rifts in reality ever be reconciled? Is history a form of science fiction? And are narrators ever reliable? The process of creating Hydrangea was defined by the search for a form to bind fiction, poetry, and musical experience. Its narrative is influenced by technical instructions, lectures and whispered conversations, in which slippage and floating focus can create new meanings in the listener that weren’t intended by the speaker.\nAspects of physical and informational security including passwords, codes, locks and obstacles speak to the ways in which meaning or material can be locked, unlocked or instrumentalised for a range of potential outcomes. Hydrangea reflects on the Machiavellian strategies of political ideologists such as Steve Bannon, Aleksandr Dugin and Vladislav Surkov who have made use of contemporary and postmodern artistic strategies to design narrative uncertainty—covertly braiding together questionable truths, slippery narratives and bespoke reinterpretations of history for undisclosed political ends.\n\"Hydrangea’s Just the Password Though, Right?\"\nChilds & Žygus employ a musical language that layers their cumulative practices and experiences. The compositions are cinematic and spatial, working with the illustrative qualities of Disneyesque string melodies and taking cues from Maurice Ravel’s impressionistic piano works.\nThe work is also influenced by both artists’ lifelong experiences of rave culture, beginning for Žygus during childhood in newly independent Lithuania, spending time juggling Disney and happy hardcore cassettes on the family stereo, and for Childs as a preteen in Australia, tagging along with her sisters to doofs and warehouse parties. Initiated while the artists were both working between Amsterdam and Rotterdam in 2017, the work also draws on Dutch gabber music.\nHydrangea’s development has been influenced by collaboration with artists and filmmakers Metahaven, who created the album art.\nHolly Childs is a writer and artist. Her research involves filtering stories of computation through frames of ecology, earth, memory, poetry, and light. She is the author of two books: No Limit (Hologram) and Danklands (Arcadia Missa); and has presented her work at ICA (London), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam), Trust (Berlin), Elam School of Art (Auckland) and more.\nGediminas Žygus is an artist working within the fields of sound, documentary and performance. Their practice assembles a spectrum of influences deriving from architecture, ecology, ethnography, science studies, and media theory. As J.G. Biberkopf, their releases have found homes on Knives and Danse Noire. Žygus has performed at Barbican Centre (London), Berghain (Berlin), Sonic Acts (Amsterdam), and Centre Pompidou (Paris), among others.",

            "about": "Download includes PDF version of chapbook containing three texts and images that expand on and weave together the album's themes.\nThroughout his career, james ginzburg has shown a relentless desire to map the musical landscape's distant poles. As half of industrial-experimental duo Emptyset he has wrestled with extremes, tearing apart techno and harsh noise frameworks and re-assembling them with endearing passion. Running the Subtext label, he has nurtured artists from across the musical spectrum, from avant jazz composer Yair Elazar Glotman and sound designer Aho Ssan, and acclaimed minimalist Ellen Arkbro, as well as co-running the Arc Light Editions imprint with BBC3 Late junction's Jennifer Lucy Allan.\nAnd as a solo artist, ginzburg has tackled folk, club music, ambient and drone with a similarly enthusiastic intellectual curiosity.\nThe last Emptyset album, 2019's \"Blossoms\", was rooted in complex sound design assembled using elements synthesized from neural networks. To challenge that approach, ginzburg set about developing an acoustic counterpoint. \"crystallise, a frozen eye\" is a patient, meditative album, built slowly and pointedly around largely repurposed folk instruments.\nOver eleven tracks, ginzburg ruminates on the complex tonal qualities of the Appalachian dulcimer, the psaltry, the shruti box, Daf drum, an acoustic guitar and a custom-made string instrument designed for Emptyset's \"Borders\".\nThe sole electronic element, a Sunn o)))-esque sub bass rumble, comes from ginzburg's Octave Cat, the analog synthesizer he used on enduring bass music classic “Purple City”, a collaboration with Bristol's Joker who incidentally mastered the album.\nHarnessing the evolving, tonally rich qualities of both familiar and forgotten instruments, ginzburg has reached a poetic musical peak, fusing his engineering experience with the expressive, fallible humanity of acoustic performance. It continues ideas laid out by artists such as Catherine Christer-Hennix, Ellen Arkbro and Laraaji, melting folk history with deep listening practices and the sheer enjoyment of both sound and duration.\nWritten in the fall of 2020, \"crystallise, a frozen eye\" brings up universal themes of isolation, safety and mortality, but traps them beneath a veneer of archeological curiosity. In looking back to the sounds and textures of pre-Christian Europe, ginzburg occupies a space that falls outside of current cultural trends. His music instead reflects our shifting relationship with time, inspiring us to contemplate memory, repetition and stasis.\nThe album is presented as limited edition short book containing images and three texts that expand on and weave together some of the record's themes.",

            "about": "six correlations was originally composed for a commissioned performance in Berlin and recorded in early 2018 over three days. The project explores the intersections between traditional music from various cultures, with a particular focus on Gaelic folk music native to the remote island regions of Scotland, where half of ginzburg’s family originates from. It incorporates influences of Iranian traditional music, Indian classical and generative composition techniques.\nsix correlations considers the relationship between the organic and the digital world as a meditation on whether modernity implicitly represents a long slow goodbye to nature: a long slow goodbye to everything that is not integrated into the networked world.\nThe response to the disappearance of both nature and non-digital culture is presented here as an aspiration to imagine and communicate an harmonious relationship between the organic and the technological.\nProduced using a hand drum, piano, voice, shruti box and Roland SH-101, six correlations brings together many of the influences from the Subtext artists james ginzburg has worked with over the last years, such as Turkish artist and percussionist Cevdet Erek and Swedish composer Ellen Arkbro – as well as connecting with his instrumental explorations with Paul Purgas as emptyset, and recent releases on Arc Light Editions such as “Salm” - an LP of Gaelic Psalm singing from the Outer Hebrides of Scotland.\njames ginzburg is one half of emptyset and founder of Subtext Recordings, as well as co- curator of the Arc Light Editions imprint with Jennifer Allan.",

            "about": "Brought up in Vilnius, Lithuania, Gediminas Žygus was first attracted to making electronic music by easy access to pirated software and the comfort of solitary creation. “Music to me was a reaction to the social environment - creating a voice, a reaction to being overwhelmed and not being able to change anything.” Currently his focus and music are driven by the influence and abstractions of theory, thinking about the way global politics shapes the earth’s ecosystem and the architectures and infrastructures of power.\n‘Ecologies II’ was made in a year that amplified the anxieties on the pages he’s been reading, where theory meets the real head-on. The album was made mainly in Lithuania while living in an apartment which had “a detailed panorama of Vilnius where you could analyse the city as a complex ecosystem”, which is also a good way of understanding the flow of the album too; the music on ‘Ecologies II’ is dense, flowing with ideas and sonic undercurrents, made for deep listening. It was also made in response to travelling the megalopolises of South East Asia which helped bring a new awareness of the world system, climates and the thick matrix of social and political order.\nThe album itself is an assemblage of field recordings that are manipulated and fused with digital programming, melody and design to startling effect, resonating with power. The album is like a supple, accelerated take on musique concrète and its techniques, subsumed into the digital realm, to the point where it’s hard at times to work out where the digital and the real start and end, but at others, the contrast is violent and raw.\nThere’s drama and melody in the music; there’s implied narrative. The album is of course indebted to some of the familiar tropes of club music but only in the sense that its forms are a starting point. The familiar use of melodies and the driving energy are forced to breaking point and intensified, escaping easy categorisation or perfunctory uses. But that’s not all. Tracks such as the melodic ‘Dust’ stop and start with trapped sampled voices underpinning the lush strings, ‘Preacher’ throws the pleading of a minister into a tense mesh of flickering voice and pumping heartbeat-like kick drum. Other parts are more or less ambient, such as ‘Irreversible. Black Atlantic.’ where underwater recordings exhibit creaking depth, against a swelling horn part. Other tracks seem to be ecosystems of their own. It’s a complex album rewarding repeated listening.",

            "about": "A state of profound abstraction has long characterized the music of J. G. Biberkopf. During a decade of post-noise experimentation, Biberkopf, aka Gediminas Žygus, explored and fabricated a hyper-mediated world. Following on from Ecologies II: Ecosystems Of Excess, this long-gestating second album, pulsing with eroticism, pushes its listener further inward. The Seed, The Sinkhole, The Flower, and The Flare is the Lithuanian artist’s most visceral release, touching on dissociation, embodiment, and grief. Žygus’s new body of work unfolds over nine interlacing compositions of intimate environmental sounds, experimental synthesizer techniques, and poetic writing built from the detritus of a life in constant flux.\nContinuing to exist in a state of transience—detached and unattached within the harsh milieu of economic precarity and ecological instability, the J. G. Biberkopf project remained suspended for the past eight years. Rumbling beneath a bedrock of personal and geopolitical crises, Žygus turned toward more collaborative work with the likes of Holly Childs, Mariechen Danz, and Metahaven. Those synergies have left a mark on Žygus’s practice, with elements of the album being based on the score for the latter Amsterdam-based artist duo’s 2021 film Chaos Theory, while Childs lends her words to two tracks. A disrupted tone carries the whispers of Elliott Lauren Ryan reciting “Do You Love It?”: You are really close to my face /And it feels fine. Meanwhile, contributions from cover artist Yen Chun Lin come in the field recordings that rise out of The Seed, The Sinkhole, The Flower, and The Flare overall.\nJ. G. Biberkopf’s return evokes the struggle to maintain a sense of identity amidst external and internal turmoil. Also inspired by trance, the word here has less to do with its point in the rave continuum and more with the psychedelic semi-consciousness of spiritual transcendence that inspires Žygus’s approach. Their relationship to this religious revelation comes from their experience growing up in Europe’s East, encountering the dissonance between being surrounded by those striving to commune with God via catholic choir singing, and a tense and multifaceted upbringing. The Seed, The Sinkhole, The Flower, and The Flare refers to this in-between space—culturally, socially, geographically, historically—while embracing the duality of the album’s titlular reference to the furtive self-exposure of longing that permeates the everyday.",

            "about": "On Sutarti Joshua Sabin draws influence from the compositional structures and psychoacoustic properties that exist within early Lithuanian folk music, exploring the emotional potency of the human voice through the manipulation of elements of archival recordings.\nObtaining access to the folk music archives of the Lithuanian Academy of Music and Theatre Ethnomusicology Archive from the outset of this project, Sabin felt a particular resonance with the extensive library of vocal recordings and specifically the song forms of the Sutartinė. Derived from the Lithuanian verb 'Sutarti' - to be 'in agreement', 'to attune' – Sutartinės are a Lithuanian form of Schwebungsdiaphonie - a distinct canonic song style consisting of two or more voices that purposefully clash creating extremely precise dissonances and the phenomena of aural ‘beating’.\nInspired by the psychoacoustic research of Rytis Ambrazevičius, whose computer analyses reveal the unique acoustic and harmonic complexities in these archival songs, and transfixed by what Sabin describes as their “arresting and often almost plaintive and minimalistic beauty”, he sought to compose directly with the recordings themselves as a raw material.\nSutarti exists fundamentally as an emotional 'response', presenting archival voices through radical recontextualisations that Sabin hopes simultaneously express both his personal perspective and experience, and also speak universally to the power and versatility of the voice as a communicator of meaning and emotion.\nProduced with archival recordings, instrumentation including, Skudučiai and Fiddle, and field recordings of Lithuanian forest ambiences.\nJoshua Sabin is an Edinburgh based composer and sound designer, who’s first LP “Terminus Drift” was released on Subtext in 2017.\nDone as part of the Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision's RE:VIVE initiative in collaboration with the Lithuanian Archivist's Association and the Baltic Audiovisual Archival Council",

            "about": "Subtext's latest signing is Joshua Sabin, a\nScottish musician and artist based in Leith,\nEdinburgh.\nJoshua's debut album Terminus Drift explores\nhumans' relationship with environment and space, and\nhow this experience is augmenting us as we further\nembrace a digital age. Our structures of\ncommunication, exploration, and discovery are\nmediated by technological shifts and we exist in\nsimultaneity between our physical environment and\nemerging cyberspaces with a blended perception of\nembodiment and orientation within both.\nSirens reverberating through station tunnels,\nfluctuating harmonics of subway engines, echoing\ntannoy systems, piercing screams of electromagnetic\nfields.\nThe sonic material of this album is composed\nexclusively of field-recordings captured in transit\nthrough Kyoto, Tokyo, and Berlin, in addition to\nelectromagnetic field recordings captured in Glasgow\nand Edinburgh. By interrogating the sonic properties of\nour physical environment, Terminus Drift imagines the\nsonic landscapes of these dualistically navigable\n'cyberspaces' we transiently create and move through\ninteracting with our world.",

            "about": "Ukrainian composer Katarina Gryvul presents her third LP, SPOMYN, on Subtext.\nSPOMYN ('recollection') is an exploration of memory’s fragile, fragmented nature, revealing how it shapes the core of who we are. Each track is a fragment — a flicker of something lost, distorted, or forgotten — brought to life through unmediated emotion, acting as an invocation of continuity, connecting us to those who came before us and the fleeting moments of their existence that still resonate within us, and become elements in the lattice of our own selves. Gryvul’s corrupted choral pop compositions, augmented with full frequency electronic and organic experimentation, characterize SPOMYN’s uncanny and chimeric sound. Much like the blurred edges of memory itself, SPOMYN resists resolution, inviting listeners to disintegrate into worlds that linger in shadow and evoke the beauty of the unknowable.\nFollowing her last LP' Tysha' ('silence'), released in early 2022 on the Ukrainian imprint Standard Deviation, SPOMYN finds itself in a changed and fractured world in which the urgency to maintain a clear remembrance of the past in the face of erasure and misinformation is ever increasing. Katarina Gryvul explores the simultaneously fixed and fluid nature of collective and personal narratives by filtering the remembrances of her cultural and musical experience through an idiosyncratic and intuitive approach to music production. The result is aggressively iconoclastic while holding dear the essence of the traditions she has inherited.\nKatarina Gryvul is a  classically trained composer, violinist, and music producer. She blends concept of holophony with avant-garde techniques to develop distinct soundscapes through instruments, voice, analog synths and spatial audio.",

            "about": "Last year, Kenyan sound artist Joseph Kamaru (aka KMRU) and French digital alchemist Niamké Désiré (aka Aho Ssan) were invited by Berlin Atonal to collaborate on a project for the festival's Metabolic Rift edition.\nThe duo had already been working together, but the offer provided the momentum to shift the conversation into another gear. Initially, they looked for thematic connections within their individual practices that might match Kamaru's meditative soundscapes with Désiré's crumbling cyberpunk expressionism, and surprisingly for two artists renowned for their grasp of minimalism, it was the opposite that drew their attention. Watching the world shift as it reacted to the spiraling pandemic, Kamaru and Désiré were moved to experiment with volume, physicality, and intense emotionality.\n“I never made something so extreme,\" Désiré says of the duo's first recording, 2021's 'Ruined Abstractions', an extended composition that matches dense, powerful low-end drones with fractal digital fuzz and smokestack bruit. It set the mood for a back-and-forth that resulted in their seismic debut full-length, \"Limen\", described by the two acclaimed artists as an attempt to scrutinize the yin and yang of destruction and creation.\nCacophonous, concrete crunches fanfare the album's opening piece 'Resurgence' - the result of their Berlin Atonal commission - but the track refuses to languish in wrecking ball devastation. Instead, powerful synthesized harmonies ring from beneath the rubble, before stifling everything in a humid fuzz of dense, emotionally-charged cinematic electronics.\nInfluenced by the prescient post-apocalyptic mood of Katsuhiro Otomo's \"Akira\" and the mythological phoenix, an immortal bird said to be reborn from the ashes of its dying predecessor, \"Limen\" is an album that sonically snapshots the anxious, floral beauty of an explosion or the colorful intensity of a raging fire. It's rooted in concepts of duality - the idea something unsettling can be viewed from a different angle and re-interpreted.\nOn the album's epic, 21-minute centerpiece 'Ruined Abstraction I + II', swirling electromagnetic interference paints a haunted parallel vista that dissolves slowly into subtle, orchestral tones and booming, widescreen thuds.\nAlmost angelic closing track 'Rebirth' meanwhile is the most unashamedly beautiful composition Kamaru and Désiré have written together, but its choral bliss is doused in petroleum noise and saturated distortion.\n\"Limen\" is an album that seeks to lift a veil of silence from the world, replacing it with maximalist bombast and vivid passion. It's a dynamic piece of work that finds its creators pushing themselves to the limits, deconstructing history as it detonates around us.",

            "about": "Born and raised in the mountains of Northeast Vietnam, Lý Trang had to push out into the wider world before reaching an artistic epiphany. Her second album \"Syenite\" is grounded in a sense of alienation, first when she left home and moved to Hanoi for school, and latterly when she relocated to Moscow just a few months before the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\nIn Hanoi, Trang's withdrawal eased when she connected with the local underground scene, joining Rắn Cạp Đuôi Collective - who released \"Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế\" on Subtext in 2021 - for short period before focusing more on her work as a multimedia artist. In the Russian capital meanwhile, her separation from home cracked open a deep yearning that swallowed up the erupting geopolitical uncertainty and disillusion, crystallizing into 10 exquisite electro-acoustic jewels.\nTrang's light-headed estrangement is evident from the first moments of opening track 'Look I Finally Have an Umbilical Cord'. Snatched cello drones whisper over ASMR rattles, church bells, static belches and whirring, factory floor electronics form a crepuscular haze that disperses into traditional rhythms and gaseous, fourth-world atmospheres.\n'So, Flag on Flag' switches paths aesthetically, juxtaposing Trang's Trish Keenan-like vocal echoes with brittle industrial percussion and dissociated music box twangs, building out the emotional narrative rather than blocking it in. The composer is keen to embed her experiences into each track, abstracting traditional elements like gongs and indigenous woodwind instruments with anxious digital processes, blurring through folk, experimental, jazz and dark ambient landscapes.\n'Arbat Station' hums with the epoch-defining energy of Talk Talk's \"Spirit of Eden\" and David Toop's \"Spirit World\", while 'Sand Congee' and 'Zero Gravity' are as weightless and terrifying as Coil's \"Musick to Play in the Dark\", or even Lustmord.  \"And as I was looking around / It was ending over again and again,\" she laments coolly on 'And Phosphenes', searching for reason as new surroundings erode around her. Hollow rhythms follow folkloric instrumental phrases, and the music buzzes with widescreen magic - it's hardly surprising that Trang has experience with scoring. She released her debut film \"Sisyphus's Cat\" last year, a conceptually complimentary short that charted the search for a lost pet in a parallel universe, and her music follows a similar trajectory, interpreting interlocking themes sonically instead of visually.\n\"Syenite\" is a bold and personal question from an artist who's restlessly looking for answers, no matter how complex and open-ended they might be.",

            "about": "The post-human reality isn’t all glistening dystopias and cyberpunk fantasies. It’s walking empty Shibuya backstreets with neon lights advertising to nobody, or molten plastic-sediment stones littering the shoreline at a Kanagawa eco-trance rave. These are some of the scenes that inspired Tokyo-based duo MIRA新伝統’s latest EP release, Noumenal Eggs —a probing, contorted excavation of sonic composites consisting complex dissonance and rich, evolving textures.\nHonami Higuchi and Raphael Leray’s latest release follows 2019’s Torque, which was a harrowing 20-minute short film and soundtrack marking the physical and psychological effects of sexual abuse and trauma. The piece was adapted from an hour-long performance that combined Japanese choreographer Honami’s confronting enactments of rape and her experience of sex work, alongside French expat producer Leray’s haunting ambient compositions. Together the piece mapped out the violence and subsequent disidentification the artist endured, while trying to cope with the drive of an industry at odds with her own humanity.\nWhile the Torque project supported Honami in healing from the injuries of the past and the severe depressive episodes of the present, Noumenal Eggs carries these distressing themes of Otherness and the body as merely a resource in a consumer economy towards the broader context of the post-Capitalocene. Deleuze and Guattari’s “desiring machines” resonate through the serpentine rumble of Leray’s lurching, fractured sound on “Howling Machines”. Honami’s guttural shrieks reverberate with the alienation of pandemic-era visits to bankrupt commercial buildings in “Hosting of Inorganic Demon”. That track draws on the weird and eerie world of Iranian philosopher Reza Negarestani’s theory-fiction, where sentient geographical regions and demonic natural resources are their own autonomous entities.\nUsing mostly FM and wavetable synthesis, the crackle and clatter of “Chronosis” emulates the feeling and fracture of time folding and space compressing like its own reverb, in what MIRA新伝統 calls “a muffled and backward spatial sensation”. Musical counterparts include the hard and fractured compositions of Ziúr, who contributes a remix of “Disembodiment” to the EP. Then there’s the influence of SOPHIE’s tactile textures and gendered vocal play—Leray sings the high notes on the aforementioned track, and Honami does the low and gurgling ones everywhere else. Coil, Psychic TV, Markus Popp and no wave icon Ikue Mori all leave their subtle marks on the gritty contingency of the release’s post-industrial noise.\nThe Noumenal Eggs cover image comes from Swiss artist Maya Hottarek, photographed by Joelle Neuenschwander. An alien-green sculpture, slick with an oily glaze, resonates with an object that exists outside of human perception. Its unfamiliar form suggests alternative futures and a new nature beyond the imagination, as defined by the late-k-punk cultural theorist Mark Fisher: “we must produce something that doesn’t yet exist and about which we cannot know how and what it will be.”",

            "about": "Artistic collaborations don't have to be exhaustive, competitive or combative. And for Berlin-based producers James Ginzburg and Ziúr, their work together as myxomy has been almost effortless. Both artists bring with them a deep history of recording in vastly different circumstances: Ginzburg has worked on bass music, folk, experimental techno (as half of Emptyset) and experimental drone, while Ziúr played in a number of bands before settling into her current explorative electronic mode. So when they started working together in 2020, it was their respective backgrounds that provided the touch-paper for an explosive artistic head-to-head.\nGinzburg instigated the process by sending Ziúr beats he'd made in Bristol in a former life, and Ziúr, fresh from finishing her PAN-released third solo album \"Antifate\", set about sculpting them into completely new forms. In response, Ziúr dispatched vignettes to Ginzburg and he did the same. As they exchanged ideas back and forth and lapsed into absurdity, the songs followed suit, evolving from raw concepts and loops into proper songs as both Ziúr and Ginzburg traded melodies, lyrics and production tricks. The duo's fragmented sketches and scribbles took on new life, channeled, refined and re-invigorated as they developed into anxious, hybridized pop jewels.\nTheir surprising stylistic choice is revealed immediately on opening track 'Sloppy Attempt', a fractured mood stabilizer that dissociates from Bristolian trip-hop into glossy android pop. Ziúr's singing voice carries the track into a sonic black hole, mutated into an alien gurgle as she gently coos the prophetic words, \"a sloppy attempt won't cut it, no no.\" And as Ginzburg takes the reins on 'A little opaque', singing over Ziúr's twisted neon electronics, it's clear that both artists have pushed each other outside of their comfort zones, providing the reassurance and comfort necessary to evolve.\nOn 'In and Until', they find an exact median between their two most recent albums. Twanging hurdy-gurdy sounds remind of Ginzburg's 'crystallise, a frozen eye', compelled forward by brittle foley percussion we last heard on \"Antifate\". A scalding industrial boil of deranged synthesizer squeals and rolling drums parts like the Red Sea on 'Toxin Out', cooling to a crust for Ziúr's half-sung words to echo overhead. \"Burn the bridges it's a choice, eat the rich, and throw up on the fuckbois.\"\n\"Myxomy\" isn't an overtly political album, but driven by a desire to create and a shared philosophical space, Ziúr and Ginzburg are naturally outspoken. Their vision of pop is twisted through history and floated on frustration, growth and constant reinvention. It's a unique mix of polar elements - light and dark, noise and silence, joy and melancholy - that centers itself on one important theme: together, we're far more powerful than we ever could be alone.",

            "about": "Berlin based, Munich born Sophie Schnell, aka Pyur, presents her second LP on Subtext titled Lucid Anarchy. Following on from the grandiose electro-acoustic composition of 2019’s Oratorio For The Underworld, the sonic world of Lucid Anarchy eschews rhythm in favour of condensed, focused pulsing electronic music that is both reduced in form, and expansive in emotional colour — seeking to communicate direct experience rather than explore narratives.\nSchnell recorded this album in a period of personal and emotional upheaval between Berlin, a tiny fishing village in Bretagne, the Jura mountains and in a Tyrolean alpine village. Experiencing extreme internal intensity amongst the fragmented, kaleidoscopic external backdrop of raw and vivid nature and alienating human environments, Pyur’s emotions found their voice in the tracks that comprise lucid anarchy — nine prismatic, nebulous and emotionally raw electronic pieces that evoke the ecstatic bittersweetness of discovering one’s continued existence amongst the perpetual collapse of certainty and self — an evocation of the chaotic interrelation between the ungraspable abstractions of inner experience and the entropic dizzying beautiful endlessness of the world we observe.",

            "about": "Munich’s PYUR (Sophie Schnell) makes her Subtext\ndebut with “Oratorio for the Underworld”, a nimble\nodyssey through vivid, otherworldly dreams.\nGrowing up immersed in her family’s work as\nshamans, Schnell draws on the techniques and\nstories of her upbringing, through which ephemeral\nforms, stories and colours seep into her sound—a\nsynthesis of hyperreal sound design, dramaturgy and\nclassical composition.\nPYUR’s fascination with the space between life and\ndeath is expressed through the weaving together of\nthe organic and sublime in a dramatic exercise in\nexpansive sonic worldbuilding.\nThe LP is a form of storytelling in which Schnell\nreimagines and takes on the roll of psychopomp,\nushering the listener into a borderless realm. She\nrelays rich legends while warm, airy timbres (courtesy\nof cellist Teresa Alvarez and violinist Juan Zalba\nFuentes) serve as guides throughout.\nWorking largely in isolation over a period of two\nyears, Oratorio for the Underworld is a document\nof “inward archaeology,” and marks an intimate\nyet grandiose journey through the psyche,\nexploring the ecstatic emotional boundaries\nbetween life and death, and body and spirit. Over\nthe two year period, Schnell constantly found\nherself inventing new and unconventional\ncompositional techniques with which to keep her\nwriting dynamic—a process key in countering her\nown obsession with the mythos of Oratorio.\nThe Bandcamp version of this album contains seven tracks not available elsewhere.",

            "about": "Rắn Cạp Đuôi - Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế\n“sleeping through the apocalypse”\n[Subtext Recordings - SUB039]\nBased in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Rắn Cạp Đuôi have been challenging their city's perception of sound art and musical experimentation since 2015, when they were all just 16 years old. Made up of multi-instrumentalist and composer Phạm Thế Vũ, bassist and producer jung buffalo (aka Đỗ Tấn Sĩ) and multi-instrumentalist and producer Zach Sch, RCĐ write and perform music that's experimental not for experimentation's sake, but because they're thirsty for fresh combinations of sounds and techniques.\nThe trio's debut \"Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế\" is a surreal and psychedelic thrill-ride through Vietnamese traditions and culture; co-produced by Berlin's Ziúr, it's a firework display of history, genre and complex emotionality that's daubed expressionistically with absurdist humour.\nThe band wields a breathless energy that's been honed from relentless live performance. Notorious improvisers, they performed at a local gallery for two days without breaks. On \"Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế\", this is routed into a series of interlocking vignettes that melt layered collages of samples with pop and trap, and unique infusions of traditional music with the raw power of Boredoms, Ecco2k and Otomo Yoshihide.\nReflecting pools of liquid ambience are channelled through beating percussion and alien electronics, while chattering voices twist and turn through scorched digital wreckage. Themes and harmonies fluidly mutate from traditional Vietnamese music forms and into cataclysmic pressurized club.\nFleshed out by jung buffalo and Phạm Thế Vũ to reflect the kinetic communication of the group’s dynamic, the tracks were subsequently reduced to a cinder by Ziúr, who beamed them into the fifth dimension.\n\"Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế \" is a vivid, unique record that introduces a powerful new force in experimental music. By raking through the distant past's cultural artifacts and reshaping them with contemporary cybernetics, Rắn Cạp Đuôi’s music plots a course to the far future.\n-----\nSinh sống và sáng tác tại thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, tập thể Rắn Cạp Đuôi luôn không ngừng đưa ra những thách thức mới mẻ trong cách mọi người xung quanh cảm thụ về nghệ thuật âm thanh và thực nghiệm âm nhạc hơn 06 năm nay, từ 2015. Với sự góp mặt của nghệ sĩ sáng tác kiêm multi-instrumentalist Phạm Thế Vũ, cây bass kiêm nhà sản xuất jung buffalo (tên thật Đỗ tấn Sĩ) và một nhà sản xuất kiêm multi-instrumentalist khác, Zach Sch, Rắn Cạp Đuôi cho ra đời và trình diễn một sản phẩm âm thanh thể nghiệm nhưng không phục vụ cho một thỏa mãn nào khác ngoài khao khát kết hợp vô tận, mới mẻ âm thanh và kỹ thuật diễn tấu.\nAlbum đầu tay với Subtext Recordings “Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế” có thể xem là một hành trình âm nhạc ảo diệu, lạ thường xuyên qua các truyền thống âm nhạc và văn hóa bản địa Việt Nam; qua tài sản xuất của Ziúr (Berlin, Đức), album là một phô diễn lung linh, sặc sỡ của lịch sử, thể tài và độ đa phức cảm xúc tràn trề tính biểu cảm, trong một khiếu hài hước quái gở.\nBộ ba Rắn Cạp Đuôi vận dụng một nguồn năng lượng mãnh liệt đã tụ tích qua vô số trình diễn live. Vốn dĩ là những con nghiện ngẫu hứng, nhóm từng trình diễn tại một không gian nghệ thuật liên tục suốt 48 giờ không ngừng nghỉ. Ở “Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế”, năng lượng ấy được điều chuyển thành chuỗi các vignette âm nhạc đan cài chặt chẽ, kết hợp các tầng lớp sample với pop, trap, lẫn các kết hợp độc lạ nhạc truyền thống trong năng lượng điên rồ của những Boredoms, Ecco2k, và cả Otomo Yoshihide.\nTừng lớp không gian âm thanh cuồn cuộn tuôn tràn được chỉnh lưu bằng nhịp gõ dồn dập, âm thanh điện tử dị thường, giữa lúc âm thanh bị bóp méo, va quật qua đống hoang tàn kỹ thuật số. Các chủ đề và hòa âm trôi chảy biến thiên từ các dạng thức nhạc truyền thống thành một thứ nhạc sàn siêu-nén cực kỳ quấy quá.\nAlbum chủ yếu do Zach Sch chắp bút sau cái chết của cha anh, nhưng thay vì chọn trú trong bóng tối, Zach lại cho ra đời cả một tụng ca đa phương đa diện về cuộc sống.\nTriển khai bởi ba khối óc âm nhạc jung buffalo và Phạm Thế Vũ như một phản ánh sự tương thông khắng khít của các thành viên trong nhóm, các track nhạc rốt cuộc được thiêu cháy ra tro bởi đôi tay/i của Ziúr, bắn thẳng chúng vào chiều không gian thứ… 5.\n“Ngủ Ngày Ngay Ngày Tận Thế” là một sáng tác cực kỳ sống động, đặc sắc thể hiện một năng lượng sống mới mẻ trong bối cảnh nhạc thể nghiệm. Bằng cách cào qua những kỷ vật văn hóa của dĩ vãng xa xưa và tái hiện chúng vào không gian số đương đại, âm thanh của Rắn Cạp Đuôi đã dọn cho chính họ một con đường tiến sâu hơn vào tương lai.",

            "about": "Initially conceived in 2022 and installed at Palazzo Re Enzo in Bologna, Six and Forty-Six is a collaboration between percussionist and sound artist Riccardo La Foresta and James Ginzburg.\nThe two pieces capture the interactions between La Foresta’s Drummophone — an array of bass drums sounded by compressed air which produce complex acoustic drones — and a custom string instrument designed by Ginzburg — a bass monochord and zither hybrid — that is activated by a set of computer-controlled solenoids and amplified. As the strings are struck the subsequent air pressure in the room subtly shifts the tuning of the bass drums, creating ever-evolving emergent structures within the drone which in turn create sympathetic vibrations in the string instrument’s strings. These spatial sonic relationships create a generative system that chases impossible unisons through countless microtonal movements and repetitive pulses.\nSix and Forty-Six explores and conjures cognitive hierarchies in frequencies, time and perception. Neither of the two artists were in the room during the recording session — rather, they were listeners in a control room, dissolving the dichotomy between the listening-player and the playing-listener as they watched their instruments interacting with each other in an isolated room.\nRiccardo La Foresta is a percussionist and sound artist based in Modena, whose work questions the role of the drum as a percussive instrument. Over the past eight years he developed a system called Drummophone, through which he creates resonances and vibrations treating the drum as an aerophone and creating acoustic drones, ancestral melodies and complex beats that drastically distance the instrument from traditional drumming. La Foresta's research blurs the lines between percussion music, sound art, improvisation, and drone music, revealing the acousmatic response of the architecture.\nJames Ginzburg is a British American musician and artist based in Berlin. He is one half of emptyset alongside Paul Purgas, and one quarter of Osmium with Hildur Guðnadóttir, Rully Shabara and Sam Slater.",

The vast exhibition center was intended to draw around two million visitors a year, showcasing the country's cultural standing both in the Middle East and around the world, but it wasn't completed. When civil war broke out in 1975, construction ground to a halt and was never resumed, leaving the sea air to slowly dissolve the 18 abandoned concrete structures. The most impressive of these is the Experimental Theatre, a huge dome that Niemeyer intricately designed as a modern performance space; its acoustics produce an uncanny \"whispering effect\" that allows visitors standing on opposite sides of the building to hear each other clearly, no matter how softly they're speaking.\nIn October 2022, Berlin-based Italian sound artist and vocalist Sara Persico was visiting Beirut for a short tour, and took the time to head north to Tripoli and explore the UNESCO World Heritage site for herself. She was immediately awed by the dome's unique sonic characteristics, so made sure to pack her recording equipment when she returned to Lebanon a year later. Although the area is disused, there are still security checks on the entrance, so Persico had to justify her unofficial presence; thankfully, a friend from Beirut had been shooting footage in the dome a few days prior, so she was let in with her gear for an impromptu three-hour field recording session. She wanted to use the time to document the architecture's impulse response - the actual recorded atmosphere of the environment itself - and by singing, screaming, whispering, moving objects and producing sound with metal plates that hung from the roof of the structure, she sketched out every corner of the theatre. Additionally, Persico was able to chronicle the omnipresent hum of Tripoli from inside the dome, letting the space sublime the voices, vehicles and wildlife into ghostly overtones.\nPersico presents these uncanny real-world textures on 'The Center Cannot Hold', the album's opening track, mingling her pebbly found sounds with vaporous birdsong that seeps in from the outside. Her voice appears for the first time on 'Brutal Threshold', forming wordless, breathy drones around corroded metallic scrapes and distant police sirens. It's as if Persico is communicating with not just the space, but with history - her processes are contemporary, but the elements themselves have been snatched from time. Traces of sacred music, folk and opera can be picked out from the layers of temporal interference, and accent a cultural conversation between Lebanon and the wider world that's still very much in progress. As she was shaping the samples, loops and percussive elements, assisted by Belgian sound designer Koenraad Ecker, Persico was struck by the richness of her recordings. \"The deeper I went, the more I realized how this music had a special energy,\" she explains. \"As I was stretching the samples, the sound was revealing more information and more details. Perhaps a place with history keeps more inside than we can perceive.\"\nVoices evaporate like stifled conversations on 'Maze', dotting sibilances throughout the soundscape impressionistically, daubing Persico's spine-chilling canvas of echoes, gong-like chimes and subtle oscillations. And she even takes more risks on ‘Rashid Karami', introducing harsh industrial groans and asymmetrical rhythms that ink unfamiliar shapes on the dome's curved interior. A rumbling, dubwise thud appears through the choral ether on 'Kairos', and on 'Voices Organ,' Persico's staccato electronic plucks punctuate a muggy haze of meditative mantras. Each track examines the possibilities of the space's unique soundscape and also the role it still plays in Tripoli, as a monument to another era that still casts a shadow on the contemporary world. On '34°26’14”N 35°49’24”E', the call to prayer can just be made out from the burr of environmental sounds and Persico's own altered voice.\"I was just listening and feeling everything around me,\" she says. \"The dome merges all the elements and creates order with it.\"",

            "about": "New York City-based Latinx vocalist, improviser and composer Isabel Crespo Pardo assembled sinonó to help bring their levitational poem-songs to life with a focus on abstraction, texture and sublime simplicity. The trio features Lester St. Louis - a New York-born improviser, composer and sound designer - on cello, Boston-born multi-instrumentalist, educator and bandleader Henry Fraser on double bass, and Crespo on vocals. 'la espalda y su punto radiante' (\"the backbody and its radiant point” in Spanish) is a bold and sinewy suite that evolved mindfully as the players established their creative relationships. For Crespo to achieve the right balance between direction and openness, songs and improvisation, they needed to figure out a special kind of rapport. Before recording the album, sinonó went on tour, changing the compositions each night to suit their mood, or simply to explore new angles. \"Everyone is a composer and improviser in their own right,\" Crespo explains. And each artist was given the room to imprint their own distinct personality. With this trust in place, the individual songs could shift and mutate while still feeling like a complete work.\n\"The process of the piece is the piece,\" Crespo adds, seeing ' la espalda y su punto radiante' as a suite unfolding as it was performed. Inspired by Jack Halberstam's iconic text 'The Queer Art of Failure', Crespo was motivated to investigate different kinds of precision, highlighting sonic artifacts instead of erasing them. What might those gestures and artifacts actually mean, and how might they add to the music's texture? On the opening tracks 'ofrendas’ and ‘qué estará pensando', Crespo's voice rises like a wave over rocky, percussive stings and drowned scrapes. When it threatens to fountain into a structured song, sinonó inevitably pulls it back into abstraction. There's a complex, interwoven narrative to the music that gushes from Crespo's poems. \"I love songs,\" they admit, \"but I also need the freedom to improvise, sculpting the music for that moment.\" So sinonó's open structures create their own reality, bending time and widening the liminal space between notes. Each piece allowed them to examine distinct emotional vignettes, taking risks and embodying flexibility in multiple dimensions.\nThe run of pieces from ‘ofrendas ii’ to ‘siento y sigo' is the album's centerpiece, initially focusing on Crespo's oscillating, rhythmic vocalizations that harmonize with Fraser's staccato plucks. St. Louis joins with frenetic, folk-inspired bursts of sound before the song changes pace in its middle stretch, gathering strength with its grandiose gestures. Then, it disintegrates into near silence; the track's final act is almost whisper-quiet, punctuated with fictile flourishes and spoken-sung phrases from Crespo that zig-zag into piercing screams. 'la espalda y su punto radiante' is a record that rewards the patient listener, allowing its songs to unfold organically, just like they did for the three players. Traveling from the solitude of Crespo's poems to the communion of shared improvisation, it's an experience that provokes empathy and imagination. Space itself is a musical language. And sinonó's space is filled with drama, warmth, intrigue, conflict, and resolution.",

                    "about": "New York City-based Latinx vocalist, improviser and composer Isabel Crespo Pardo assembled sinonó to help bring their levitational poem-songs to life with a focus on abstraction, texture and sublime simplicity. The trio features Lester St. Louis - a New York-born improviser, composer and sound designer - on cello, Boston-born multi-instrumentalist, educator and bandleader Henry Fraser on double bass, and Crespo on vocals. 'la espalda y su punto radiante' “(the backbody and its radiant point” in Spanish) is a bold and sinewy suite that evolved mindfully as the players established their creative relationships. For Crespo to achieve the right balance between direction and openness, songs and improvisation, they needed to figure out a special kind of rapport. Before recording the album, sinonó went on tour, changing the compositions each night to suit their mood, or simply to explore new angles. \"Everyone is a composer and improviser in their own right,\" Crespo explains. And each artist was given the room to imprint their own distinct personality. With this trust in place, the individual songs could shift and mutate while still feeling like a complete work.\n\"The process of the piece is the piece,\" Crespo adds, seeing ' la espalda y su punto radiante' as a suite unfolding as it was performed. Inspired by Jack Halberstam's iconic text 'The Queer Art of Failure', Crespo was motivated to investigate different kinds of precision, highlighting sonic artifacts instead of erasing them. What might those gestures and artifacts actually mean, and how might they add to the music's texture? On the opening tracks 'ofrendas’ and ‘qué estará pensando', Crespo's voice rises like a wave over rocky, percussive stings and drowned scrapes. When it threatens to fountain into a structured song, sinonó inevitably pulls it back into abstraction. There's a complex, interwoven narrative to the music that gushes from Crespo's poems. \"I love songs,\" they admit, \"but I also need the freedom to improvise, sculpting the music for that moment.\" So sinonó's open structures create their own reality, bending time and widening the liminal space between notes. Each piece allowed them to examine distinct emotional vignettes, taking risks and embodying flexibility in multiple dimensions.\nThe run of pieces from ‘ofrendas ii’ to ‘siento y sigo' is the album's centerpiece, initially focusing on Crespo's oscillating, rhythmic vocalizations that harmonize with Fraser's staccato plucks. St. Louis joins with frenetic, folk-inspired bursts of sound before the song changes pace in its middle stretch, gathering strength with its grandiose gestures. Then, it disintegrates into near silence; the track's final act is almost whisper-quiet, punctuated with fictile flourishes and spoken-sung phrases from Crespo that zig-zag into piercing screams. 'la espalda y su punto radiante' is a record that rewards the patient listener, allowing its songs to unfold organically, just like they did for the three players. Traveling from the solitude of Crespo's poems to the communion of shared improvisation, it's an experience that provokes empathy and imagination. Space itself is a musical language. And sinonó's space is filled with drama, warmth, intrigue, conflict, and resolution.",

            "about": "For the twentieth anniversary of Subtext, we present a literary Anthology titled, “Cybernetics, or Ghosts? — Stories from Myth to A.I.” alongside a sister compilation of music.\nEdited by British-Nigerian writer and artist Michael Salu, the anthology comprises fifteen short stories written in response to Italo Calvino’s seminal 1967 essay, “Cybernetic and Ghosts.” Within this essay Calvino traces the development of language from mythology to a speculative future of automatic writing systems.\nCybernetics, or Ghosts? follows 2023’s Fifth Quarter: Derek Jarman, Keith Collins & Dungeness as the first publications of Subtext Books, a sister imprint of the label.\nCompiled by Subtext’s James Ginzburg, the compilation has contributions from the labels current and forthcoming artists, as well as from artists that were instrumental in the beginnings of the label, such as Roly Porter who, as one-half of early industrial dubstep project Vex’d — producers of the first two singles on Subtext — left an indelible mark on electronic music of the 21st century so far. These first two releases in 2004 and 2005 would be followed by six years of dormancy as Subtext founders James Ginzburg and Robert Ellis (aka Pinch) focused on on other labels, while they waited to find equally singular music to follow up the initial Subtext releases with.\nIn 2011 Roly Porter played James the demos to his debut solo album “Aftertime” and agreed to allow Subtext to release it on the condition that emptyset, also compilation contributors, released their LP Demiurge on the label first. The label has remained active since, curated by James.\nOther compilation contributions come from KMRU and Aho Ssan, Vietnamese collective Rắn Cạp Đuôi, Cairo born / Berlin based producer ZULI, Turkish composer and artist Başak Günak aka Ah! Kosmos, Ziúr, PYUR, xin, Holly Childs & Gediminas Žygus, Gonçalo Penas, MIRA新伝統, Amina Hocine, Eric Holm and Bridget Ferrill.\nThe artists, coming from equally diasporic backgrounds as the writers, were all asked to respond musically to the anthology, drawing inspiration from its texts and structure — and reflecting on how developments and evolution of technology used to generate text are mirrored in recent developments in the rise of generative AI for music.",

            "about": "Annie Garlid's second album as UCC Harlo is a meditation on the concepts of habitat and berth, comparing the nostalgia for an idealized nature of the past with a creative understanding of both urban and rural land in the present. \"Topos\" means \"place\" in Greek and also connotes a literary theme.\nThe album was motivated by Garlid's move back to the USA in 2018 after spending almost a decade in Europe; when she returned to her home country she was struck by its simultaneous familiarity and foreignness. During the pandemic, she was rooted in a single time zone for almost two years in a row, driving up and down the coast between New York and Maine. She became increasingly tethered to and entangled with a place that was both in her memory and in front of her eyes, more precarious than ever. The album reimagines the topography of the USA, sketching out a map free of man-made borders where metropole and wilderness are blurred into one another.\nBased in New York City, Garlid is a writer, musicology scholar and classically-trained musician who has collaborated with Caterina Barbieri and Emptyset, as well as being a member of the Holly Herndon Ensemble.\nShe brings this experience to \"Topos\" in a number of different ways, expertly navigating the fertile ground between electronic and acoustic music, contemporary avant-garde and classical techniques. Her work as a writer and academic is also integrated this time around; while on \"United\" her vocals were mostly wordless, \"Topos\" developed using text she felt helped to deepen the impression of place. On 'Ocelot', an homage to Elysia Crampton aka Chuquimamani Condori, she reflects on the eponymous cat she was obsessed with as a child.\n“Ocelot, you rush between the rare earth and the tree / between the margay and the sergal,\" she hisses in careful, spoken tones over woody rhythms, choral harmonies and sputtering electronics. It's not a million miles from Jon Hassell's legendary fourth world recordings, but Garlid isn't attempting to build an imagined world with her music, rather inviting the listener to notice what's here in our world.\nThe instrument that nestles at the center of \"Topos\" alongside Garlid's voice is the baroque viola. She's been performing and touring as a viola player for years, and is able to deconstruct its physicality as an instrument made of tree wood and gut strings, played with horse hair. The medieval influences that danced around her debut album are in the background this time around, but by using her instrument so anatomically she suggests centuries of push and pull between emotion and refinement. 'March 6' juxtaposes pizzicato strings with theatrical vocal phrases and hollow, natural rhythms, sounding like a neoteric nursery rhyme until it dissipates into labyrinthine, ornate melancholia. 'Riverbeds’ is a poetic reflection on the drought Annie encountered on a cross-country trip, and the lengthy 'Forest Floor,' a flooded study of wellness culture, evokes a viridescent mood with dewy crackles and movie score FM plucks that build into a powerful, bass-heavy crescendo.\nFor Garlid, \"Topos\" is an album about connection that reaches out across her community: her sibling Thea performs on vocals, while friends in New York and Berlin (Eve Essex and Rebecca Lane) play saxophone and flute, respectively. Drawing parallels between internal and external weather, Garlid explores our relationship with nature and each other and celebrates the presence of animals in our lives and imaginations. Her music is charged but hopeful: these aren't doomed laments to a dying planet, but segments of a chart that might help us contemplate the mystery in the present.",

            "about": "In United, her debut LP as UCC Harlo, classically-trained musician Annie Garlid distills hauntological pop, sound art, medieval and baroque music, and left-field club production into a series of ecclesiastical-wave ventures.\nWritten over six years in Germany, United began on train commutes during Garlid’s stint as a violist in an opera orchestra near Cologne and developed further during her time in Berlin. Through gestures such as reframing music by Bach and Magister Zacharias through DAW experimentation and field recordings, United proposes sonic reconciliations between the old and the new.\nUnited also reflects the idea that sound and music always exist within historical and environmental contexts and are mediated by emotion. United acts as a means of “sounding” ambivalence, doubt, and messiness in an age that demands transparency and clarity.\nAnnie Garlid is a New York-based writer, musician and musicology researcher concerned with our ever-shifting, tenuous relationships with ecology, technology and care.\nShe is a member of the Holly Herndon Ensemble and the band Songs, has collaborated with Caterina Barbieri, Bill Kouligas and Emptyset, and has performed with ASMR-artist Claire Tolan. She works regularly with an array of composers and artists, and performs as a viola player and singer in Europe and the USA.",

            "about": "xin returns to Subtext to share their debut LP, MELTS INTO LOVE.\nMining fragments of neurofunk, hardcore and dubstep, xin searches for something else. They borrow from dance and rave lexicons to warp, mangle and strangle tropes into something anew. Embracing failures, blemishes, inexperience and misuse, xin imagines new affinities, anxieties and ecstasies in an age of noise, spectacle and inundation. Alien, shapeshifting reeses dance and twirl in “Myopia,” while AI choirs and pseudo-breaks are distilled into “Spent, Wasted and Saved” (featuring AYA, fka LOFT). The fiendish, ecstatic imagery that accompanies is created in conjunction with painter Gabrielle Bejani and machine learning engineers Ash D'Cruz, and Chris Tegho.\nLike xin’s 2018 EP, MELTS INTO LOVE will be released solely via independent platforms Bandcamp, Boomkat and Resonate. The record also borrows from fellow Subtext signee Fis and his Saplings project and is released as a “biodigital” LP—meaning the music is released digitally, but with a living consequence woven in. All proceeds from sales will be donated to Eden Reforestation Projects, with each purchase of the LP funding the planting of at least 40 trees.\nxin has recently performed live at Berlin’s Volksbühne, in support of Holly Herndon’s PROTO launch, and Kraftwerk, for MaerzMusik’s The Long Now, among others. They are soundtracking Zach Blas’ upcoming installation The Doors, and are a summer 2019 research resident at Trust, Berlin’s space for utopian conspiracy and the (re)design of infrastructure.\nwith thanks and love to:\nAya, Billy, Izzy, James, Laurel, Oscar, Sam\nArtwork:\nAsh D'Cruz, Chris Tegho, Gabrielle Bejani and xin",

            "about": "Subtext presents xin's first release, To Shock the Sky and Shake the Earth.\nTo Shock the Sky and Shake the Earth is a process of searching. It sees the Berlin-based artist navigating spaces between conventions, cultures, pressures and sounds. This informs their decision to release the EP through Resonate and a handful of independent platforms.\nOn this decision, xin says: “I don’t believe that there should be one way to do anything, or in convention for convention’s sake. I’ve been thinking a lot about the ethics of making and releasing music, and trying to find less harmful ways of being in the world.”\nThis statement points towards growing dissatisfaction around independent music’s reliance on corporate monoliths, from Facebook to Spotify. xin's decision is made as one gesture in a much broader, quickly-evolving discourse.\nxin’s particular approach is also evident in their production, which lacks consistent genre signifiers for listeners to grab ahold of. Tracks such as ‘Black Light Blind Fire’ and ‘Sucker’ lean on dance music’s lexicon, while ‘Aedes Splatter’ is comprised of shudders, sputters and hums. 'To Shock the Sky and Shake the Earth' is an unusual synthesis of varied sounds.",

            "about": "Under his guises Blessed Initiative and Ketev, as well as his\nown name, composer and sound artist Yair Elazar Glotman\nhas explored extended techniques and processes to forge new Tracklist: sonic textures and musical forms. Compound picks up where\nthe previous solo work under Glotman’s own name - 2015’s\nÉtudes - left off. The acoustic sound palette has now expanded\nfrom solo contrabass into a trio including pianist Rieko Okuda\nand percussionist Marcello Silvio Busato.\nGlotman guides the trio into utilising sounds from the edges of their instruments’ abilities - arguably mere byproducts of harmony - and through improvisation, repetition, and post- production, conjures new sonic bodies over two sidelong pieces. His guidelines for each improvisation gave the players autonomy to emphasise the microscopic details of certain sounds: the shudder of a piano key, the hum of a cymbal, the incidental click of a plucked contrabass string. The recordings were then layered and reformulated by Glotman into two separate structures to complete the composition process. Both ‘Veil’ and ‘Revelate’ utilize the full spectral potential of each instrument, revealing new rhythmic patterns and harmonic content in the process.\nTaking Glotman’s microscopic focus on instrument noises he put began on Études as a starting point, the trio on Compound ultimately bring into question both density and contrast, rhythm itself losing its stricter structures and becoming a purely pattern-based driving force in the music. The resultant unit contradicts and opposes itself, all sorts of clashing rhythms and melodies coexisting within the body of the two compositions of evolving sonic architecture.\nBased in Berlin, Yair Elazar Glotman is a classically-trained musician and sound artist. Besides previous works on Subtext including Études, a collaborative score with James Ginzburg experimental film Nimbes, and the eponymous debut of his Blessed Initiative project, Glotman has released music via Opal Tapes and others under the nom de plume Ketev.",

The soundtrack, realised within the vast interior of Berlin's Kraftwerk power station, employs the cavernous reverb of the space in response to the video's encompassing narrative of scale, time and entropy. Centred around the use of contrabass and elemental percussion, the stark rendering of instrumental sound crafts an evocative portrait of this former industrial site, mapping an overarching texture onto the underlying acoustic compositions. The project draws parallels to Ginzburg's sonic spatial explorations within emptyset alongside Glotman's own forensic examinations of rhythm and tonality initiated through his work as Ketev, bringing the two into a formal dialogue through techniques of acoustic production.\nThe release is accompanied by a remix from Eric Holm, reforming the material through his dense custom created signal chains, and a remix from Yair Elazar Glotman who extracts the essence of the original recording and sculpts it into an adeptly controlled vista of sound.\nNovember 2014",

            "about": "ZULI presents an EP that extends the landscape of 2024’s LP “Lambda” on Subtext — comprising one remix and two original tracks that continue the creative conversation he began in his studio in Cairo five years ago, and developed in Berlin over the previous two years.\nThe emotive “Care” centers around a field recording of ZULI tapping on the neck of an unplugged guitar. The field recorder was at the other end of his home studio in Cairo, right by the window, so when a car-crash-turned-street-fight broke out, the whole thing was captured and integrated into the track. Every emotion seems to be equally present in this study of simultaneous restraint and maximalism, creating something uniquely melancholic and uplifting.\n“Elysian Blue” explores production techniques employed in Lambda; simple melodies with a focus on slowly evolving textures, conjuring the peaceful tension of having left a significant event somewhere in the distance, while having its evaporating profundity escape description while welcome intrusive fragments of its memory alternatingly stab and caress the heart.\nThe other piece on the EP is a remix track from “Lambda.” Ludwig Wandinger remix of “Ast” featuring Coby Sey teases out the original’s R&B dna and mutates it into a hallucinogenic and soulful eruption of sensual experimentation.\nLudwig Wandinger is an experimental producer, drummer, composer and visual artist, based in Berlin. He has worked and performed with a variety of forward thinking musicians and artists such as Elvin Brandhi, Kianí del Valle, Luka Aron, Evita Manji, Grischa Lichtenberger, Brodinski, Female Pentimento, Yves B. Golden, Sara Persico, 645ar, Jim Black, Keith Rankin, the Notwist, Klahrk, the Berliner Ensemble, Kirke Karja, Dan Nicholls, House of Base, John Object, Zylva, Elias Stemeseder, Fausto Mercier, Petter Eldh, TAU, Roomer, Moran Sanderovich, Lucia Cadotsch, Nomi Sladko and many more.\nHis music has been released on genre-defying labels Light Years, Orange Milk Records, Gin and Platonic, Creamcake, 3XL, Mutants Mixtape, Acna Rusd and Average Negative, accompanied by collaborational releases and co-production credits for releases on PAN, A Flooded Need, Squama, Genot Centre, BMC, Ware and SFX.\nOver the years he had the chance to go perform in Ecuador, China, Switzerland, Vietnam, France, Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Philippines, Canada, Poland, Indonesia, Iceland, Latvia, Austria, Romania, Finland, Estonia and Norway with highlight festivals being the likes of Jazz Fest Berlin, Moers Festival, Magnet Festival, A l´Arme Festival, Neue National Galerie, Berlinische Galerie, 3hd Festival, Punkt Festival, Jazzfestival Reykjavik and many more.\nHis multimedia art gets released under the moniker \"kirschbluetenimwind\" and has been presented at the \"Digital Fog\" exhibition at Urban Contemporary in Berlin 2022, the Keyframe Digital Art Festival in Vienna 2022, the Pop Up Gallery Berlin 2022, the \"Mana Exhibition\" in Shibuya, Tokyo 2022, as a part of the collective “1_1pr_f2r_sm” showcase at Art Basel Hongkong 2023 and at the exhibition \"The Staircase - Nah...Nobody Home\" in Prague 2023 by Proto Gallery Systems.

            "about": "ZULI's widest-reaching and most ambitious album to date, 'Lambda' is a conspicuous left turn for the Berlin-based Egyptian producer. Draped in gauzy, granulated textures and woven with enigmatic vocal flourishes from collaborators MICHAELBRAILEY, Coby Sey and Abdullah Miniawy, it's a vivid, soul-searching set of polychromatic reflections that sets fire to the boundaries between ambient, trip-hop, industrial music, chamber pop and symphonic noise. In some aspects, 'Lambda' reveals ZULI's softer side; gone are the earth-shaking chopped rhythms and stop-start outbursts of corroded static that characterized his last full length, 'Digla Dive - Live'. But peer beneath the brain burrowing vocal melodies, mangled instrumental loops, anxious poems and subtle, harmonic synth washes and a new kind of intensity lurks in the shadows.\nSince his early releases on Lee Gamble's UIQ label and his 2018 breakout 'Trigger Finger', ZULI has notched up major global acclaim for his futuristic, kinetic musical diversions. He cut his teeth supplying beats to local rappers back home in Cairo, soon shifting his attention to the city's burgeoning dance underground, promoting events, DJing prolifically and tirelessly supporting the scene's most experimental fringe. In 2019, ZULI teamed up with Rama to curate the irsh series of video transmissions, evolving the project into a label shortly afterwards. And now situated in Berlin, the duo have extended the concept to encompass an ongoing sequence of genre-averse club nights. All this experience and constant creative motion is etched into the foundations of 'Lambda'. It's an album that plays liberally with euphoria, but feels constantly precarious, intrepidly peering out from its tense internal world.\nLead single '10000 (Papercut pt. 1)' is one of the album's most unexpected cuts, featuring a soaring falsetto vocal from Hamburg-based British composer and performer MICHAELBRAILEY. \"What do I have to show for it?\" he asks suggestively, while ZULI replies with seismic bass rumbles and celestial, harp-like chimes. Building towards a crippling, dense crescendo, the track is among the weightiest ZULI's ever produced, replacing his signature beats with industrial metal drones and razor-sharp electronics. Brailey also shows up on the symphonic 'Syzygy', singing sweetly until he stretches his voice into mutant echoes, augmenting the chorals with powdery, granulated hisses and surreal piano phrases. On 'Plateau' meanwhile, ZULI works alongside virtuosic multi-instrumentalist and singer Abdullah Miniawy, who calls to the heavens as digitally pulverized strings quiver in the background. And cult British artist Coby Sey adds his unmistakable tones to 'Ast', mouthing tense, thoughtful words over mangled music box jingles and ecstatic pads.\nWhen he's not straddled by his collaborators through, ZULI is free to make some of his most personal gestures. He fashions a phantasmic, pitch-fluxed robotic croon on 'Trachea', curving it around half-speed hip-hop clacks and cinematic drones, then driving it into walls of impermeable noise on 'The Horn'. And the album's most revealing moment comes with the short 'Fahsil Qusseer', when ZULI recites a poem written by his father. Stretching his voice and a tape-saturated break like elastic, ZULI mimics the emotional push-and-pull of the protagonist, who overcomes their anxiety to escape into the outside world, only to retreat immediately back to the safety of solitude. The track puts the whole of 'Lambda' into sharp focus - through the walls of noise and exuberant, intoxicating waves of ambience, ZULI finds solace in limbo between the manic extremes.",
