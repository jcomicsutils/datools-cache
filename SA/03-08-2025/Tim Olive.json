Whether it’s good chemistry between the two musicians or the structural sonic elements, like a steady drone or rumble grounding the more dynamic features, or a noisy section smoothly transitioning to something subtle, the pieces aren’t loose or meandering. At times the sounds conjure an image of a telegraph machine gone haywire or a scene from a Cold War movie where high-tech radio equipment or codebreaking gear is in use. A solid set of well-executed electronics.",

            "credits": "released August 29, 2020\nMarc Masters, Bandcamp Daily:\nSound artists Anne-F Jacques and Tim Olive have been recording together on and off for half a decade. Though both hail from Montréal, Olive has lived in Japan for some years, but makes it back to Canada frequently enough to revisit this ever-fascinating collaboration. For Bistre, their fourth release together, the pair sat down last year in their hometown to concoct six tracks of minimal, tense sonics. Jacques plays what she calls “rotating devices” (small electronic motors that are manipulated and amplified) while Olive uses magnetic pick-ups. This spartan set-up produces a wide range of sounds, all executed with healthy doses of restraint and distance. At times listeners might find themselves leaning in close to catch all the small whirrs, statics, and pin-prick sounds, but Bistre is perhaps best enjoyed more passively. Let all of Jacques and Olive’s tiny aural events seep into your brain without trying too hard to process them, and they tend to stick there for a while.",

From the label:\nFurther audio evidence, if any was needed, that Mr Olive has the full skill set when it comes to mishandling sound. Out in his hovel in Kobe, Japan he worked with hours of mono radio signals which he recorded through a simple chain of eq, spring reverb and preamp before he chopped, combined, layered, arranged, scrambled, juxtaposed & quilted to just the right degree so as to turn the inside of most listeners skulls to brain tepenade. Warm and cozy!\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nOn ‘Chocolate Radio Band (The Golden Sceptre)', Olive continues to delve into the world of transmissions. The signals are fed through equalisation and a spring reverb before landing on tape/computer. Olive stacks these recordings together and finds a dialogue in these sounds. There are drones, broken transmissions, voices, scrambled and distorted. Olive allows for some repetition here and there, which is not something I often heard in his previous work. Olive is a master when it comes to offering variation and dialogue. Unlike, say, John Cage, there is no randomness involved here. Olive picks his sounds for a reason and works them into four thoughtful pieces of music.",

            "credits": "released June 7, 2023\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nHere Olive works with a collage approach towards his noisy sound material. Everything buzzes and shakes; there's feedback and distortion, but not as an end. Olive is not a man to simply blast away. His noise comes across as intelligent and thought out. His improvisational skills help him play around with the material very easily, but by layering and mixing, he takes a more compositional route. The music has a tangible feeling as if he's manually destroying mechanized objects, along with the buzzed repetitions of a synthesizer. This is some mighty intense music, but I enjoyed every minute. There is a particular element of lo-fi ambient music, but heavily amplified, disguised as noise — an interesting diversification.",

            "credits": "released August 4, 2023\nMarc Masters, Best Experimental Music on Bandcamp:\nTo make Der Hafen, Chemiefaserwerk (aka Christian Schiefner) and Tim Olive created sounds on their own, then handed them to each other to edit and mix. The result: two 15-minute tracks that are significantly different, both in sound and arrangement. “Der Hafen 1,” in which Olive works with Schiefner’s material, is dark and reverberant, as if recorded underground with no other human beings around. Schiefner’s prepared tapes and mixer feedback give Olive rich tones with which to paint eerie portraits. On “Der Hafen 2,” Olive mines more tangible sources—including magnetic pickups and tuning forks—which spurs Schiefner to create a palette of clanging noise, as varied as it is confrontational. It would be fascinating to hear this pair continue this semi-blind conversation, but Der Hafen offers enough to get lost in for a while.",

High computer tones go up against doomy electro/drone stylings, paranoid late-night surveillance atmospheres, the sound of live electricity and tense drawn-out test tones. The closing “Ghosts” is one of the most beautifully hysterical shots of post-tongue electronics this side of Ryoji Ikeda or Borbetomagus. Wow.\nDan Warburton, The Wire:\nThe album title is also the name of Gilles Deleuze’s celebrated thesis, but if you’re into that post-structuralist stuff and buy records accordingly, you should be warned that this is about as far from Mille Plateaux (the record label) as you can get. From the opening “Wolf In Center Page”, which disappears into silence without warning about halfway through only to return to bite your ears off, via the menacing thuds of “Ontology” and the low queasy growl of “Multiples” to the banshee shriek of “Ghosts”, it’s a rough ride, nasty but nice.",

            "credits": "released May 13, 2020\nDan Warburton, Paris Transatlantic:\nOlive’s last outing with Bunsho Nisikawa, the intriguingly-titled Supernatural Hot Rug And Not Used, was mysterious and compelling; Eagle Keys is even better. It’s superbly paced, carefully constructed and above all sounds terrific. Check it out.\nEd Pinsent, The Sound Projector:\nEverything Tim Olive does seems to end up suggesting some real steps forward for the improvisation genre, rich in possibilities and exploratory notions. Regardless of who he plays with, he always offers useful platforms for ideas to develop.\nMarc Masters, Noiseweek:\nSince I last spewed about Tim Olive, he’s put together the great Supernatural Hot Rug And Not Used (and a great self-titled album) with Nishikawa Bunsho, which I implore you to seek out if you haven’t. This is his new project, and it’s the standard kind of high-level, attentive improv that Olive has trademarked…Olive knows how to coax smart shit out of his equipment and his colleagues, and Eagle Keys is perhaps the best example of one of his most unique talents – the ability to mix and match sounds so that nothing ever sticks around too long, but no contrivances or artificial shifts ever emerge.",

            "about": "Tuning forks, metal resonator, blank cassette tape, tape loops, magnetic pickups, octave divider, spring reverb, preamps\nRec. April/May 2021, Kobe\nMixed by Tim Olive\nMastered by Phil Maguire\nOriginal release on MRM Recordings, March 2022",
            "credits": "released May 6, 2022\nEd Pinsent, The Sound Projector:\nCanadian Tim Olive here with Eye Hill, Arm River (MRM60), on the label Minimal Resource Manipulation run by Matt Atkins in London. “Manipulation” of “minimal resources” happens to be one of Olive’s fortes in his music, and on this occasion he’s not even “playing” a recognisable instrument, thus placing ten thousand pedantic music fans in a conundrum as he wields tuning forks, metal resonators, magnetic pickups, spring reverb. I feel we’re getting the after-shocks of vibrating metal, the resulting waves fed through layers of philosophical thought and theological debate until they’re recast as abstract propositions. One might imagine it as a series of essays on bells and carillons, but instead of being researched by an expert campanologist, the subject is rethought by a scientist who thinks we could harness the power of bells to do other things, such as grow vegetables or travel into outer space. We do all of these things very slowly, while crawling inside a large and capacious drain pipe that’s about 56 miles long. In short, another excellent episode of unique sound processing musical performance.\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nI had these four pieces on repeat yesterday afternoon, on a very moderate volume, while engaging myself in some tedious accounting job, and Olive's music had that effect that great ambient music should have on the listener; \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular, it must be as ignorable as it is interesting\" and that's precisely what Olive does. I enjoyed his previous work a lot, but this is his best yet. However, I love ambient music quite a bit, and if this review spurs you to seek out his music, this might not be the right place to start. I am sure many Olive fans will be surprised by this release, but I hope as pleasantly as I am.",

            "credits": "released December 3, 2020\nNotes from original release:\n\"Kahn (American, living in Zurich) and Olive (Canadian, living in Japan) recorded these pieces while on tour in Japan in May 2014. This release features two unhurried explorations for radio, synthesizer, and mixing board (Kahn) and magnetic pickups (Olive). “Fukuoka” presents a series of gradual unfurlings; pockets of pockmarked, dented and torn glass clusters, tumbling upon and over each other, perhaps briefly interlocking by way of some fragile barb, only to instantaneously break loose. “Osaka” is more comfortably structured, framed by a few small squalls abetting the range of synth and radio static; an instrumentation that resides between thin layers of shifting, jittery translucent timbres.\nKahn and Olive both demonstrate exceptional attention to unrecognized sounds (see Kahn's ongoing Unheard Cities project), and one of the unique attributes of these pieces is their ability to make sounds whose sources, even with limited tools, aren't quite placeable. Their sound palette occasionally finds tension between understood words and speech as sound: hearing a sound that may or may not be speech, and speech that may or may not be understandable. They possess a unique resourcefulness on this release that makes it a surprising listen.\"",

            "credits": "released May 29, 2024\nFelthat Reviews:\nTwo long tracks which incorporate magnetic pickups, pieces of metal, electromagnets and spring reverb. It somehow keeps the dynamics of harsh noise music but in a more improvisatory context. Feedback and harsh squirms of noise and droning put the whole thing into motion and commotion. Never monotonous, always ready to switch gears, it steers away from idiosyncrasy towards some larger form that has the guts of a metal machine. An interesting journey which helps us to understand how little is required to create a complete form.",

Two of the pieces are studio-recorded (Kobe) vocal/magnetic pickup journeys into, if not the heart, then perhaps the liver, of what seems to be some sort of semi-darkness. The intervening piece (synthesizer/magnetic pickups) was recorded live in Osaka, and somehow channels the conflict and majesty of the battle section of “By-Tor and the Snow Dog”. All pieces have been edited/layered/structured for maximum (melo)drama.",

            "about": "Takuji Naka - tapes/electronics\nTim Olive - magnetic pickups/electronics\nRecorded in Kyoto, Japan, 2019\nMastered by Branic Howard, Portland, OR\nArtwork by E. Lindorff-Ellery\nPrinted by Small Fires Press, New Orleans\nOriginal release on Notice Recordings, July 27, 2020\nFrom the label:\nOlive and Naka's collaboration pairs two musicians working with lo-/mid-fi sonics and modified/self-made instruments. Through extensive recording and touring, the duo has honed a patient aesthetic, allowing each other's sounds to unfold with minimal, sure-footed interactions, akin to moving along a path up the mountain for which this release is titled. Naka's sources here consist mainly of \"long loops of sagging/distressed cassette tape winding into and out of similarly distressed portable tape players, with real-time analog processing.\" Olive uses magnetic pickups and analog electronics. This leads to sounds of uncertain provenance, playfully emerging from a thick analog haze, building toward surprising, subtle crescendos. This is work that results from, and produces, an active semblance of stillness.",
            "credits": "released October 17, 2020\nMichael Rosenstein, Dusted:\nMinouragatake (a mountain outside of Kyoto, Japan) is the fourth recording by Takuji Naka and Tim Olive, a duo that has played together for close to a decade now, melding together music of slowly evolving rich timbral abstraction. Each are consummate collaborators and for this session, they make their way across the seven untitled tracks with steadfast focus to the nuanced details of their respective sound sources. Naka utilizes “long loops of sagging/distressed cassette tape winding into and out of similarly distressed portable tape players, with real-time analog processing.” Olive uses his regular array of magnetic pickups and low-tech analog electronics, drawing out volatile hums and changeable striations that coalesce with his partner’s slowly devolving layers of sound. These pieces are imbued with unflappable deliberation, each sound integrated into the cohesive, gradually unfolding improvisations. Each of the pieces sound as if one is tuning in mid-stream and end with a sense that they could continue on indefinitely. Rather than adhering to any formal developmental arcs, the two patiently sit within unfurling sonic worlds as layers ebb and flow. Naka’s degraded tapes lend an aura of catching wafts from some distant celestial emission which Olive subtly shades and colors with hisses, whispered mutable fuzzed gradations and aural grit. Snatches of scumbled lyricism morph into static-laden swirls; washes of flaked and tattered textures disperse into shuddering thrums. Naka doesn’t record much so it’s good to hear another project from him. Olive has been on a particular roll as of late and this one is a laudable addition to his discography.",

            "about": "The third and final Nimrod album, released in 1997; rather confusingly self-titled, being the third release.\nOriginally released on Scratch Records (Vancouver), January 20, 1997\nZev Asher - Digital/Tape Processing, Text, Voice\nTim Olive - Bass, Electronics\nFeaturing:\nOhno Masahiko - Guitar (3,7)\nUchihashi Kazuhisa - Guitar (2,8,10)\nYamamoto Kosei - Winds (4,6,9)\nYamamoto Seiichi - Guitar (1, 5, 11)\nM.V.P. - Text (11)\nRecorded in Osaka and Vancouver Winter 1995/96",
            "credits": "released February 1, 2025\nOriginal 1997 Scratch Records press release, slightly edited for brevity:\nSooner or later, most of us give up on the rock and roll. All that aggression wasted on bashing and screeching and seeming to be angry about....about..well who knows....it all seems so silly after a while. The gentlemen of Nimrod played the thud/noise rock sweepstakes, but fact is, they were just simply too disorienting a rock ensemble to really appeal to the black rock T-shirt market, beyond their core audience of a few thousand faithful who drank their ginseng because they somehow knew.\nSince 1994's The Mighty Hunter/Lab 36b, wholesale changes have swept over the mothership Nimrod. Drummer and resident loose wheel Sam Lohman is no longer in the band. Surviving members Tim Olive and Zev Asher replaced his powerhouse drumming...well,... with no drumming at all. Alongside the rhythmic departure goes as well any faint resemblance to typical song structure the boys may have employed. Bass player/composer Tim Olive has been busy playing/recording/releasing music with Beauty Pear and Twerdocleb. Vocalist/sounds champ Zev Asher has recorded and released much material as Roughage, as well as exhausting himself making a feature length documentary exploring underground culture in war-torn Croatia. I believe I will go out on a limb and venture forth the brave statement that the period between albums has seen Nimrod undergo profound artistic growth. To think it took twenty two releases for Scratch to get to utter that phrase!\nAs on Nimrod's previous albums, this one features many collaborations with Japanese musicians. This time, rather than cameo appearances, the guests play a much more significant (one-third) role. Nimrod (the album) is a series of improvised duets recorded live to DAT in Japan between Olive and Masahiko Ohno (Solmania), Seiichi Yamamoto (Boredoms, Omoide Hatoba), Kosei Yamamoto, and Kazuhisa Uchihashi (guitarist and collaborator with Altered States, Otomo Yoshihide's Ground Zero, as well as Hans Reichel and Fred Frith). The raw duos were shipped overseas to Asher in Vancouver, where he added sounds and murky narration, and basically completed the puzzle. What we have here with album number three is basically a baffling free-form collection of pieces that somehow fits under a number of genres: Outside jazz, noise, soundtrack, ambient...pushing this recording into any of these corners is taking the easy way out...The reality is this is a damn strange album that will challenge most if not all who dare, and reward grandly those who come back a few times for more.",

            "credits": "released May 13, 2020\nBrian Olewnick, Just Outside:\nNo credits are given as to instrumentation or composition but the first track opens with a simple, melodic electric piano line that sounds as though it’s from Paul Bley circa 1973 (I’m guessing it’s Hoffman) accompanied by the crunchiest of noise, though the latter is sparely deployed. The rest of the music isn’t this overtly mellow but it does play very nicely with the tension between surface sheen and underlying anxiety. Most of the time, one of the pair is producing softer-edged sounds (though not melodic)–rumbles, cloudy thrums, etc. while the other is worrying this weave with needlelike shards or irregular jags of static. Even the fourth track, all aflutter with rapidly fluctuating flapping sounds and screeches, sounds as though it’s being restrained, held in check by the overarching hollow throb that achieves dominance at the piece’s conclusion. The thoroughgoing sounds that are almost always in place give one a sense of stability, but the tones and textures of the other elements pick at any feeling of comfort, painting a bleak, ultimately corrosive soundscape. Really impressive work. Hoping Hoffman and Olive continue this collaboration.",

This time incorporating radios, he summons ghosts of tubes and transistors past. Tactile!",
            "credits": "released May 6, 2022\nEd Pinsent, The Sound Projector:\nTim Olive applying his disruptive and imaginative skills to radio sets, waving his arms near a hundred transistor sets and making uncanny sound art out of the noise of tuning dials and distorted voices, sounds floating mysteriously in the controlled noise, a form of concrete-noise-poem he’s creating from the airwaves. “He summons ghosts of tubes and transistors past,” states the note on Phil Maguire’s Verz Imprint page, suggesting that Tim isn’t merely manipulating the present, but is somehow reaching back into history and capturing the voices from the air, hopefully rewriting outcomes as he does so. Another essential gem with a great cover and lovely package too.\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nOlive's work has a fine brutality to it. He doesn't go for the cheap effects of plain noise, or too much repetition. There is much variety, and on various occasions, he cuts the sound away and starts something different within the piece. Great tape!",

Of course, it’s impossible to know whose sensibilities are poking through at any given moment. Both sides are blown-out documentations of unsettled materials, with Jerman using percussion, metal objects and prepared turntables while Olive opts for magnetic pickups, metal objects and circuits. Yet the flavour of the over-blowing is different on each side; “Pancakes 1” has a distortion that fizzes particularly in the upper frequencies, latching onto whistling feedback, denting the stretches of clattering, cupboard-rummage attack. In contrast, “Pancakes 2” sounds like it’s writhing out of a small radio, with textural collisions squished into a hapless speaker that can’t physically accommodate them. Is the recordist or the mixer responsible for this buckled fidelity? Perhaps a blend of both? As the name suggests, Pancakes delights in this very ambiguity: the mangling of materials, of roles, of discernible sound sources into two congealed and ungainly pucks.",

Maybe the rhythm machine is a residue left behind on one of those tapes? The music of 'Quince' is a combination, super imposition if you will, of two concert recordings. One is from their April 2016 European tour and a recording from Kyoto some eighteen months later. Both Naka and Olive have a long history when it comes to playing densely orchestrated improvised music and 'Quince' is such. The bottom end, the groundwork if you will, is laid out with some heavily textured drone-like sounds, built from radio waves and electrical sources, whereas on top things burst and bubble with Olive suggesting construction site field recordings, mixed with again with more chopped up short wave recordings. It's all about electronics, feedback, and disruption and, for the lack of a better word, noise, but all of this with a rather spacious approach. It is delicate yet dense; open in approach and closed in execution. Having spent some time with both gentlemen I am surely a bit biased, but I love it.",

Jan-Feb 2021, Kobe\nMastered by Anne-F Jacques\nCover by Evan Lindorff-Ellery\nOriginal cassette release on Notice Recordings, October 2021\nFrom Notice Recordings:\nTim Olive returns for his third album on Notice, a rare solo outing from this avid collaborator. “Ribbon” is a document of his highly developed relationship with amplified object manipulation, in a manner most cathartic and engaged, and yet informed by compositional sensibility. This release is constructed from multiple tracks of a variety of sound sources recorded in his studio in Kobe, Japan; these tracks have then been edited and layered, in shifting densities and evolving textures. Despite the abrasiveness of these recordings, there is a certain kind of sensuality in their interactions. One may sense that these pieces can be touched, as if the air has become solidified, like slowly forming glass, flecked with mineral impurities, a movement shuddering in locked-place, shedding, bristling with multi-textured shards and strands of sonic material.\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nIn good musique concrète, layers are edited and mixed to make a more or less coherent whole. What I find interesting is that Olive maintains an improvised music sensibility. Not in a chaotic way, but not editing too precisely, while at the same time taking care that sounds don't overstay their welcome. Using amplification allows for a particular distortion in his music, but that too is worked on with the highest effort, not to create a noise record, but to allow the noise to be an equal partner in the music. At times this sounds like a classical noise record, early New Blockaders in 'Ribbon 2', and then again, something introspective and 'quiet', culminating in the excellent drone ending of 'Ribbon 4'. At thirty minutes, perhaps short, but all the same, quite powerful as well.",

On the other side, he opens with such tones, which, on both sides, have a lovely ambient texture, helped by some fine reverb. The mood in the second half, the first half, is dark and moody, but also open and spacious. But then this mood becomes less spacious and closes up again, forming another, tighter mass of drones sounding still dark and moody. This is not to say that both sides are identical; far from it. 'Sheer 1' is the louder and somewhat noisier brother of 'Sheer 2'. Here, the textures are much more gentle and spaced out, but in the loosely organised first part of the dark ambience of the second part, it slowly becomes grittier, like a delicate noise beast. As said, I immensely enjoy Olive's solo studio work, and this is no different.",

            "credits": "released June 25, 2024\nFrom the label:\nTim Olive lives in and operates out of Kobe, Japan, where he has built an impressive discography of solo and collaborative recordings using magnetic pickups as a primary instrument. Sintered was created with several of these magnetic pickups, along with metal objects, radios, and spring reverb. Working with such temperamental technology, it’s clear that Olive’s intuition and timing are assets put to good use here, sharpened from decades of collaboration and improvisation, from his early work as a core member of avant noise-rock group Nimrod through his continuing collaborations with Anne-F Jacques, Jason Kahn, Takuji Naka, Kayu Nakada and many others. With a sharp ear and a steady hand at the helm, Sintered unfolds almost as if the hum and interference of the electronics were simply being presided over, carefully guided to elegant compositions of their own internal logic.\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nArmed with his array of magnetic pickups, metal objects, radios and spring reverb, all trusted partners in creating some of the more exciting forms of noise and drone music. It's at times quite heavy, and the four pieces on 'Sintered' seem notably louder than some of the other recent solo releases. From the information, I learned that he was a member of the noise-rock group Nimrod, which I may have known, but wasn't aware of. Maybe Olive thought it was about time to do something relying more on the noise aspect for this release. Each piece has a mildly distorted undercurrent or some downright feedback, such as in 'Sintered 3'. The music weighs heavy on the eardrums, but it is a pleasant sort of noise, in my opinion—nothing too loud, not too abrasive and yet with a hard edge. My favourite is the last one, where Olive puts extra menace on the drones and creates a creepy, dark atmosphere. Olive's music is somewhere between improvisation and composition and once again, excellent stuff.\nAV, Rocker magazine:\nPleasant tape of slowly paced drones, hypnotic rhythmic patterns, and crude electronics. Sintered is a relatively minimal affair overall, with some harsh tones used in service of something other than “noise”, calm electronic drones that don’t become hazy ambient, feedback that never seems shrill. Crescendos that rise in intensity but don’t give way to full explosions of chaos, creating a nice, lasting feeling of light tension throughout the release. Olive’s subtlety and tact are on full display, not going overboard in any direction, and calmly letting the sounds play out. I could see this as being nice to zone out to, particularly the third track, with its rolling metallic patterns, kind of an electronic take on Satie’s furniture music.",

While not overly intense experience, Olive manages to cram in a few rather extreme moments among a overall runtime of calmer yet still very dystopian feeling noises and sounds. On that note, dystopian is probably my favorite word to describe this album, even through there is nothing explicitly said towards this theme. The magnitude of the sounds here can seemingly vary so wildly, with moments to suddenly build into madness then fade away. But throughout the whole album, there is this almost simmering feeling, one the never lets you forget about the madness that lies ahead and behind. Smelt consists of five tracks labeled in numerical order, opposed to having formal names. The first track may throw you off a bit as it is one of the more cacophonous tracks on the album. However, the next track that follows is the one that shows us the aforementioned \"simmering\" side of the album. Low electrical hums persist throughout the track as occasional noises of scraped strings appear momentarily only the disappear again, all while the electrical feedback builds and morphs slowly. By the time we, get to the final track, that intensity we hear in the first track has returned. But then it disappears and ends our experience in that slow simmer of feedback and hum. Smelt essentially gives the impression that it is a soundtrack for a broken and dying industrial world.",

            "about": "Tim Olive — tuning forks, spring reverb\nRecorded and mixed in Kobe, May 2022\nMastered by James Armstrong\nOriginally released on DAT by Korm Plastics/NDWICM in November 2022. Priced here in accordance with label request.\nBauke van der Wal, Vital Weekly:\n\"Sticky Shed\" is almost 15 minutes of the sound of tuning forks and spring reverb. And you might now think the same as I was thinking: \"how can that be interesting?\" Well, it is! First of all, tuning forks aren't only available in one frequency (we all know the 440Hz from music lessons) but come in all sizes and materials. Because of their purpose, the sound of tuning forks is pure, so they generate a great starting point. Even though they touch the 'pain' point quite often, it never hurts. The combination with the raw edge of the spring emphasizes the purity of the forks. The digital version has an extra track which amazed me: way more subdued, lower frequencies, dronier and less experimental.",

That last element is key, as without the wry humour, the album’s reductionist style could sound dry. Instead, Olive and Bunsho’s cacophony often suggests Raymond Scott as an improviser.\nJason Bivins, Signal To Noise:\nThis disc rages with eight nasty improvised interventions in just under forty minutes; it’s a terse, inventive statement brimming with energy and imagination. There are no lines, no grooves, nothing of the sort. These fellows play machines, sound generators pure and simple. A fascinating, unexpected pleasure of twisted noise resounding from the slag heap.",

            "credits": "released February 1, 2025\nOriginal 1994 Scratch Records press release, slightly edited for brevity:\nNimrod are two Canadians (Olive and Asher) and one American (Lohman), who divide their time between Osaka and Vancouver. The Mighty Hunter/Lab36B is their second album. Tim, Zev and Sam’s past and present musical resume boasts stints with Dustdevils, Bustmonster, Soap-Jo Henshi, Arijigoku, Twerdocleb, Flying Testicle, Merzbow, No Control, Sheer Terror, Dead Voices on Air and Roughage. Nimrod have collaborated with many Japanese musicians; most notably Yoshimi (Boredoms) on Grandson, Mayuko Hino (C.C.C.C) on the Getting Rained On 7” and Masahiko Ohno (Solmania) on The Mighty Hunter.\nThis new album is actually the sum of two separate and very different recording sessions. The Mighty Hunter half was recorded in early 93 in Japan, and it features a very brutal Nimrod in their “conventional” live format of bass (Tim), drums (Sam), and toys and vocals (Zev). Shortly thereafter Zev took up residence in Vancouver, effectively leaving Nimrod with half an album (6 songs) finished. The solution saw Tim and Sam record a flurry of bass and drum tracks in a rehearsal space, send the tapes across the planet to Zev, who weaved his four track living room cut-up/collage magic. The resulting 19 snippets of skull carnage became Lab 36B.",

            "about": "Takuji Naka: tapes, spring reverb\nTim Olive: magnetic pickups\nRec. 2013, Kyoto\nMastered by Oshiro Makoto\nCover images by Tim Olive\nOriginal Release on EM Records, 2015",
            "credits": "released May 13, 2020\nLucas Schleicher, Brainwashed:\nRecorded near Kyoto in 2013, The New Attractive is named for a pamphlet written by Robert Norman, a 16th-century English navigator who discovered and described magnetic dip using a compass that moved vertically rather than horizontally. It’s an obscure nod to the technology that makes this music possible: namely magnetic tape and electricity. Some semblance of both appears in the music, whether it’s through the warped signal of manipulated tape, the metallic clang of spring reverb, or the even rise and fall of synthesized tones. Whatever Naka and Olive do with their equipment, the rawness of the noise and the fragility of the field recordings that briefly flicker in and out of it serve to emphasize the medium itself, and that includes the electromagnet as much as the ferric-oxide.Large sections of The New Attractive are aeriform, dispersed to the point that the co-existence of their parts feels like an accident. Some might call it ambient music and choose to focus on the way the different elements harmonize, and that’s a legitimate way of listening to this music. Naka and Olive mine the pleasures of synchronicity by allowing their materials to speak for themselves. But it’s perfectly natural to wonder what else is at play on an album like this one. Are the artists speaking through the music? Or is something being channelled through the artists, either despite them or because of their willingness? It’s as if the artists are giving us a glimpse of a much bigger picture, not because they’re creating sounds, but because they’re carefully, sometimes passionately, selecting them.\nEd Pinsent, The Sound Projector:\nAnother exceptional record of intimate, unusual, noisy improvised electro-acoustic music from Tim Olive is The New Attractive. Olive always has an uncanny flair for seeking out strong collaborators, like-minded souls with whom he can share the joy of music creation, and on all such endeavours I’ve heard there is always refreshing lack of ego, none of the conceitedness and bombast you might get with some of the big names of the avant-festival circuits and their promiscuous groupings. Here is an uncanny blend of Olive playing his magnetic pickups, and Naka playing a spring reverb device and selections from his library of cassette tapes. What he does with these tapes is fascinating…low-key, understated fragments of documentary sound are deployed with the sensitivity of a water-colour miniaturist, carefully and sensitively exploring tones and timbres. I like the printed description on the obi, which alludes to “out-of-date sound sources”; a phrase which might refer to the cassette player itself, a machine some regard as near-obsolescent. What we hear in these five episodes are exciting and tense tangles and knots, tiny battles where the gentle tape drift is pitched against the tide of the near-brutal grunts and slams produced by pickups and the spring reverb, generating wayward and juicy feedback eruptions. Incidentally it’s great to see Tim Olive continue his quest to “deconstruct” the electric guitar, if that is indeed what he’s doing; he’s eliminated the strings, neck and body and got it down to just the pickups, so what will he jettison next?\nThe release is decorated with cartographic speculative sleeve art by Olive, and arrives with a thoughtful sleeve note by the writer and musicologist Yu Wakao. His take on the much-discussed history of “noise music” is one of the most refreshing I’ve read, full of useful questions and speculations instead of the aggressive assertions we usually get from self-appointed experts in this area. He also mentions the 16thcentury scientific tract on magnetism from which this release takes its name. Very high recommendation for this beautiful piece of forward-looking, inventive and unusual noise.",

He moves from quiet vibrations to cacophonous clangs of metal on metal. His approach reveals the details of the sound without the emotional grandstanding that often accompanies such explorations by some of his noisier peers. The result is an organic collection of sounds, exploratory and revelatory in its subtle accumulation of detail.\nFrancois Couture, Monsieur Delire:\nA short but intense record of all-out sonic experimentation…His research is serious, in depth, and produces crude yet complex sounds that are not brutal at all. This is the strongest album I have heard from Olive yet. Impressive.",

            "credits": "released May 13, 2020\nBrian Olewnick:\nRecordings culled from two stops on a 2015 tour by the pair, each wielding an assortment of electronics. Rotational devices are clearly in effect (more from Jacques, I think) and provide an effective throb 'n' pulse to undergird the excellent grimy, raw noise that makes up the core language. It's an area explored by many others, a generation of industrial-grade sounds that cycle in varying phases, creating an infernal-factory aura. But it's also one I'm quite partial to, easily imagining myself in such a climate, immersed in the massive sound slabs, aurally buffeted by the whir and clank of rusty gears, the groans of decaying turbines, etc. The first of the two tracks is more in this dense vein, the second imparting a feeling of an abandoned space, the machines still humming but less insistently, neglected, farther along the path to end of their functional life. Good stuff.",

When these amplified and acoustic millstones of truth are combined with Olive’s basket of wasps and mosquitoes, the results are quietly spectacular, like watching a damp fireworks display upside down on the moon through sunglasses. I especially like it when we find ourselves spelunking a chasm of volcanic rock, as we do on track two, and the foothold on these treacherous surfaces is tenuous at best. The best improvised music should inculcate a certain sense of danger in the listener.",

            "credits": "released June 7, 2023\nEd Pinsent, The Sound Projector:\nOn Tuxford Fumble our favourite Canadian innovator Tim Olive gets down and dirty with his shortwave radio, and his magnetic pickups and spring reverb – devices which he uses to affect the polarity of the globe, transform objects into living creatures, and breed insects that can reverse climate change once released in sufficient numbers to swarm across the skies. The cover image seems to depict a man water-skiing, except the background is crazed like an old Renaissance wall-painting, and his activities have caused him to turn into negative-man like from an episode of The Outer Limits. The strange music of Olive can, I make no idle boast, sometimes bring about unexpected physical changes such as these. The “Tuxford fumble” refers of course to a particular move in American football, of which our man Olive is an adept, here transposed into musical actions with great success. As ever with Olive’s music, we always get the sense of genuine experimentation and genuine adventure; the outcome, if indeed any outcome is intended, is never a foregone conclusion, and he explores these unknown avenues wishing to find out what lays at the other end. Even a potential cul-de-sac turns into a gateway to a nature reserve, all hurdles in the way instantly receding into the pavement at the flick of a switch.\nFrans de Waard, Vital Weekly:\nThis is not a noisy beast, but loud and mean it most certainly is at times. Two pieces, both of the same length and starting with a collage of shortwave radio but slowly evolving and morphing into some beautiful subdued drone music; especially on 'Tuxford Fumble 2', this is the case. In 'Tuxford Fumble 1', it all stays on a rougher edge of drone music, but in both pieces, Olive shows he knows his way around some lo-fi drone music and does some excellent work in this crowded musical field.",

Among the overt sounds of metal, such as the gnashing metronomic attack of the first piece or the intermittent scrapes of the third, are the flocks of strange hums rising out of the system, unfurling into evermore complex states as the machinery continues on its endless, precarious loop. Deeply tactile and mysterious.",

This collaboration exemplifies co-creation, as each artist reworks the other's source material through their own creative lens. Specifically, parts 1 & 2 feature a broad palette of tools (electric guitar, radio, modular synthesizer, field recordings) employed by Metaxas to craft his trademark sound over the years, with Olive's concrete and collage logic enriching the textures in a powerful way, resulting in a full embodiment of the latter's personal semi-motto 'I can live without \"music\", but I need sound'. In parts 3 & 4, Metaxas distances himself from his usual processes, leveraging sonic textures from Olive (magnetic pickups, radios, envelope generator, spring reverb) to create abstract electroacoustic environments with some harsher drop-ins. The entire project maintains remarkable coherence throughout, and listeners are left with the realization that \"Wayward Acorn\" brought the two musicians as close as they can get within a broad sonic realm.\nTim Olive has been a sound explorer for more than 30 years now. Born in Canada but long residing in Japan, he works with magnetic pickups and simple analog technologies to investigate, invoke and amplify the inner voices of metal objects. His personal discography includes collaborations with artists like Jason Kahn, Takahiro Kawaguchi, Anne-F Jacques, Fritz Welch, Francisco Meirino, Matt Atkins and Frans de Waard among others. His discography with the avant noise rock band Nimrod (along with Zev Asher) include collaborations with Masonna, Mayuko Hino (C.C.C.C.), Yoshimi (Boredoms) and Masahiko Ohno (Solmania), but that's a story for another time. His work has been released on a variety of labels including BISAD, Chocolate Monk, Dasa Tapes, EM Records, Falt, Grisaille, MRM, Molt Fluid, Notice Recordings, Pilgrim Talk, Steep Gloss, Tsss Tapes, 845 Audio and more.\nSavvas Metaxas has been extremely active lately in terms of releasing music under his own name for labels like SUPERPANG, Line, noise-below, Glistening Examples, Falt, Granny Records, Grissailes and more. He co-runs the labels Granny Recods (since 2008) and Dasa Tapes (since 2021). He was part of the experiment trio Good Luck Mr Gorsky. He was Inverz. He performs with RETE. He comes from Thessaloniki, but resides in Athens. His album \"Hypnos\" (CS-30) was released by Coherent States back in 2019",
