            "about": "Ser was the project that would eventually develop into the Depressive Black Metal cult act Sadness.\nAs the definitive highlight in the project's history, \"In Fade of Memories\" is both an epic and monumental creation of Depressive Black Metal and Dark Ambient/Dungeon Synth as well as a very noteworthy release in the prolific artist's entire discography. In his own words: \"This is the most important album to me of everything I've done.\"\nWhen we came across the album several years ago, we were taken in completely by its immersive, overwhelming, and downright creepy atmosphere. To us it is the perfect soundtrack for dark and solitary nights in lost places.\nBack then, we knew immediately that it had to be released on physical format, and that it should be done by Northern Silence. We secured permission from Self-inflicted Photography to use some of her breathtaking photos for the artwork and waited for the artist to finish the album in the way it was intended.\nNow, several years later, we're finally able to release this massive, almost three-hour masterpiece on CD. For us this is one of the best and most essential releases in the history of Depressive Black Metal/DSBM and not to be missed!",

For every soft euphrasic lent of the flowers the world holds an erian glimpse of mortal love, and earthly sorrow... Her tears wept away to the fog, in mistful hideous agony and abending laughter, slowly all fluttering cheer falls to the light in a desolate scape, which illuminates those crest falling flakes unto a blanket of winter's end. To all a wander's perfection, so much of a sky even to fall with the weight of; Still dressed by an ebony flower, and bridled down a fickle trail.",

In her solitary despair , after her last frozen tear falls she bleeds into the cold, frigid bath. Her arms weak and fragile, she rests her head and all ends in cold, gritted stone. As her ghost sulks by day to the sound of laughter, children play in the woods, every night she haunts in the room, where sick and desperate love once was, where all was once stood... If not a beautiful young girl, much like her, to present into the dark few notes, a lullaby for the dearly hauntful.",

She laughs and scars, tears edges of butterfly wings and mals of gritted canvas; the window lit floor parses and aches for winds through unnerving heartache. She lightly sings a melody and pulls her arms of trembled branches, loves and longs in helpless denial, and she quivered a name... Brought to bear and petrichor of blood and sparrows' tears to fly amongst forlorn rain. A helpless, afflicted precessional towards amore and leaves, uttering few sonnets along death to moon. Lash of her arm up to ever oak ash, she yells.... \"Luciana!!!! DieVehr a lovet... I lucidly vain...\" She whispers her sanity a blood rose clover of seven memories... and cries.... Oh love her autumn, said love and as the soles of Lucy cut a rite on her heel she sculpts swallowed touch and embraces. She watches her ache and despair, her evoked pallor, a captive chant to beg a lust, for just one moment.... Where were you... for three, drei, lone eclipses....",

For that last moment she stared at the face, in despair filled beauty. She stared back, aspite the evanescence which clasped so tightly the rejoice of love, in its most painful, purest form...\r At the glimpse of her knees, fell to the earth and grave in grace of a brideless orphan. She cries to the forest sparse of anyone... at the edge of every mournful word her wrists run off light astray, parting the knowing for if anyone can hear her sing, or if finally the existential vineyard left a note...\r To lore the loom of branches, she won't know\r To love another autumn... So speaks her helpless voice",
