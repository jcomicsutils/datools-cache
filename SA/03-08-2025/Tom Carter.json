            "about": "“Ajax Peak”\nThe legendary and lengthy musical accomplishments of both Susan Alcorn and Tom Carter make it quite difficult to briefly summarize…\nWith the pedal steel guitar and her deep attention on said instrument’s voice, Alcorn’s love for innovation, experimentation, and improvisation radiates her beautiful work in amazingly cosmic ways. It has a deep discipline for transporting the listener, both physically and spiritually. It’s a higher consciousness indeed. Her continuous work, both solo and with a variety of similarly minded explorers, is never not exceptional.\nTom Carter’s iconic electric guitar playing has graced various outfits and constructions for what seems like always, most notably in the ever-shape shifting duo of Charalambides with Christina Carter. His unceasing passages between the more psychedelic sounds of rock and folk and the otherworldly places found in improvisation gives his body of work a superbly envious fluidity.\nWith their duo album, “Ajax Peak”, the instrumental and improvisational giftedness that both Susan Alcorn and Tom Carter deliver is set gorgeously ablaze for all to listen and experience. The four tracks on the album swell and swoon as Alcorn’s pedal steel guitar and Carter’s electric Les Paul variant intertwine and create an extra-sensory musical set that is perceptively attuned at being both passionate and meditative. For music as reflection, “Ajax Peak” provides this in visions and ways that are now and immediate as well as deep and long lasting.\nIn regards to relevant album information, in the words of Tom Carter, “Susan and I recorded “Ajax Peak” in Houston, Texas directly following a long car ride conversation back from Austin that we had about Hank Williams Jr.’s legendary mountain climbing accident. This topic of discussion ended up serving as a psychic framework for the album and basis for the cover-art.”\nDrawing Room is proud to bring “Ajax Peak” to the world at this time.\nDuring this extremely difficult junction in US history, a portion of cash proceeds and profits from “Ajax Peak” will go to Black Lives Matter and the Black Visions Collective. “Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist. Keep loving. Keep fighting.”",

            "about": "Lonesome Bootleg:\nAs with many legendary recorded bootlegs, the myth is always twice as tall as the truth, and that statement is only appropriate when the fable is factual. The wonder and ponder of it all is best left for cloud dreaming. In reality, headspace filled with visionary music can only be satiated when finally experienced. Yeah, we’ve all acquired a thing or two from western man’s endless unlocking of Robert Zimmerman’s magical vaults.\nUpon the extremely tardy release of Lonesome Bootleg, a secret door from the collaborations between Tom Carter and Robert Horton has finally been open, and with this unveiling, one’s dream experience now has earthbound journeys to intake. Recorded between 2007 and 2014 with Carter on guitar and Horton on a plethora of instruments, Lonesome Bootleg is a beautiful visit into the wandering American tall tale where everything and anything wonderful feels possible. It’s a gorgeous set of instrumental tunes that melds present and past US song centuries into something of its own unique time. For travelers and journeymen, it’s a required musical compass.\nTom Carter\nTom Carter's electric guitar work weaves strands of melody, drone, fuzz, and charged silence into intricately detailed instant compositions. He presently re-resides in Houston, Texas.\nBest known for his work with iconoclastic acid-folk improvisers Charalambides (which he co-founded with Christina Carter in 1991), Tom Carter has focused on solo performances and recordings since 2012. His 2015 double LP on Three Lobed Records, Long Time Underground, is the final installment of a trilogy begun in 2009 with The Dance From Which All Dances Come and continued with 2014's Numinal Entry. The Out Door/ Pitchfork selected Long Time Underground as the number-one experimental album of 2015.\nTom Carter frequently collaborates with other musicians…\nRobert Horton\nRobert Horton is a rabbit born to a banjo and a boot on an island called Post. At an early age, he strung strings upon his boot and made music. When he met Tom Carter he became human for an undisclosed reason. He was sad. He wasn't a tree but oh well. According to The Wire magazine Horton is part of a species of Americans called dumpster divers. This does seem to be true. He lives in El Cerrito, California…",

            "about": "Long Time On the Road is a pile of performances drawn from a long tour I did (along with Carter Thornton and 75 Dollar Bill on a few dates) in 2015, after I'd been playing these songs a while and was interested in breaking them down/ stretching them out. Each performance varies widely in mood, and improvisations form most of the minute count.\nAfter ruminating for months on what to do with this stuff I've decided to release these seven sets all at once. Barring discovery of something truly odd, this is the last release I'll assemble with these particular songs. Enjoy!",

            "about": "Pitchfork's #1 Experimental Album of 2015 -  pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/9773-the-best-experimental-albums-of-2015/\n--\nThis 2xLP can be purchased from our friends at Divide by Zero Records by following this link -  dividebyzerorecords.bandcamp.com/album/long-time-underground\n--\nA man in a crisis, Faulkner once wrote, always falls back upon what he knows best. Three summers ago, Brooklyn-via-Houston guitarist Tom Carter was in crisis. On tour in Europe with his pioneering psych-folk unit Charalambides, Carter was stricken with pneumonia, complications from which impelled doctors in Berlin to place him in a medically induced coma. Family members, bandmates and lovers of otherworldly music everywhere watched and waited during the six weeks Tom spent in the intensive care unit and the additional month in a rehabilitation facility. Sighs of relief were exhaled throughout the worldwide warrens of underground music when Tom finally returned to New York in August 2012, convalescent. (The incredible 99-track compilation Deserted Village released the following year to help defray Carter’s medical expenses plays like an almanac of global head music.) The steady stream of outstanding recorded music Tom Carter has released over the last two years, both solo and collaborative, suggests a man more than returned to form—falling back on what he knows best, but somehow better.\nTom Carter’s new solo album, Long Time Underground, is nothing short of stunning. While Carter shrugs off suggestions that Long Time Underground represents some sort of sea change in his approach to making music, this (along with its companion post-illness release, Numinal Entry, on Halatern) comprises his first solo work this decade. Long Time Underground, moreover, is the first solo studio recording Carter has ever done.\nLong Time Underground is almost unsettling in its purity. A collection of fractal guitar études, the album is comprised mostly of composed material—some of which was written in the studio, some worked out in performance over the past few years. Each song was set down live without overdubs, and the result is an almost confessional intimacy. The sprawling side-long opener ‘August is All’ begins in a kind of languorous humidity, Carter’s bell-like guitar chiming against a scrim of cicada song and building to a storm of jagged heat lightning before subsiding again. Carter’s guitar is painting landscapes here, conjuring a panorama in such vivid colors and textures that one is happy to idle there for a time. ‘Entreaertne’ is an electric prayer, set against the harmonium-like breathing Carter somehow elicits from his guitar. The bluesy, cascading dirge of “Carvedilol Cowboy” has just enough swagger to almost count as rock and roll. The luminous “Prussian Book of the Dead” slowly transmutes a hopeful, hymn-like progression into bright, buzzing angelic noise. (The song’s title, with its intimations of mortality in Berlin, promises something radiant, if not quite human, awaiting us all on the other side.) The album closes with an older song, “Colors for N,” an earlier version of which appeared on Carter’s 2007 Whispers to Infinity CD-R, a barbed wire song of devotion.\nNo one even passingly familiar with Tom Carter’s past work will be terribly surprised by the breathtaking musical talent displayed on Long Time Underground. Although even long time fans may be startled by the sheer completeness of the worlds Carter manages to summon with a single guitar recorded in real time. The shock, I think, is the emotional clarity of the work. The album eschews the searching, exploratory (sometimes aimless) quality typical of latter-day psychedelia because it always seems so assured of precisely where it is headed. This may, of course, be attributable to the predominance of composed over improvised material on Long Time Underground. But it may also be the emotional groundedness of a man long detained from friends and loved ones and so possessed of immensely richer sense of home. As aesthetically and emotionally complete a musical experience as you are likely to have all year, Long Time Underground is simply the work of man, mortal but still illuminated.\n-Brent S. Sirota-",

            "about": "Originally released by Digitalis Industries in an edition of 100 as part of the Arroyo subscription series, 2007.\nRecorded at a second story flat that I used to laugh at before I lived there. This was laid down in a marathon session on xmas or xmas eve 1991, details are hazy. The only documentation on the master tape lists Christina on vocals, but I can't find any trace of them (maybe she was supposed to add them later and never got around to it). Other notations deepen the mystery (\"slo playback\", says the tape, but my current 4 track seems to not screw down as far as the old Porta One).\nThe intention behind this recording was to have some sort of elongated \"ritualistic\" music to serve as soundtrack for whatever lengthy meditative task that might pop up. A 100-minute cassette, at the Tascam's slowest speed, would yield 60 minutes of music before you had to flip it over—recording one track, flipping the cassette & recording back in the other direction, and so on. The idea was for the music to be as placid as possible.\nWhat you get here is a version edited for musicality, maximum emphasis given to ecstatic guitar whatsis. As you can expect, a ton of hiss sounds, but more because one of the tracks is a microphone hung out of the window. (Pieces of this very recording turn up on a couple of later Charalambides releases—notably Our Bed Is Green and Houston).\nOriginal master title: \"Farewell to Roach Manor\". Terrible, hence the re-titling.",

Listen *closely* at the track's opening and you can hear him instructing the engine room that the goal is in sight and to push the engines just as hard as it takes. Thirty-seven minutes later, you're right there with him.",

From the 2007 Wholly Other mail order catalog description: \"Four live (mostly) improvised guitar & lap steel pieces, shimmering modal folk/blues/raga frameworks collapsing under the weight of myriad microsounds, ebows, & slides and reforming into quietly pulsing, interlocking networks. A summation of all the solo fretwork motion up to the point where that approach was back-burnered in favor of collaborative efforts, wah, & electro harmonix. Artwork by Natacha Robinson (A Vintage Burden artist) front and back.\"",
