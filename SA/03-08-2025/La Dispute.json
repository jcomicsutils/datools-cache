Some of them have been cut, arranged, and manipulated (only slightly, sometimes unintentionally) to cooperate with time of each song and to fit as well as possible with the movement of the music they accompany. It is our sincere hope that, in doing so, the author’s intended end product has not in any way been compromised.\nAll instruments recorded in the warehouse of Modern Hardware, Sunday the 6th of April, with the overhead door open, excepting Track 3, which Brad recorded in his bedroom sometime later. All vocals recorded in the ladies bathroom at Modern Hardware, during non-business hours, Thursday of last week.\nBrad recorded everything.\nWe printed/packaged everything.\nYou mean everything\nThank you.\n*This download also includes album artwork, lyrics, and liner notes.",

            "about": "All lyrics on Here, Hear II were borrowed from people far more equipped to speak them ourselves. Some of them have been cut, arranged, and manipulated (only slightly, sometimes unintentionally) to cooperate with time of each song and to fit as well as possible with the movement of the music they accompany. It is our sincere hope that, in doing so, the author’s intended end product has not in any way been compromised.\nAll instruments were recorded at various locations around Chad’s parents’ house on Hanna Lake in Caledonia, MI between the 24th and 28th of August, 2008. Vocals were recorded at the warehouse a little over a week later.\nThis is No Sleep Records 013.\nBrad recorded everything.\nTroy mastered everything.\nYou (still) mean everything.\nThank you.\n*This download also includes album artwork, lyrics, and liner notes.",

            "about": "All tracks on Here, Hear III (save for the sequenced “drum beat” in Vass’ song) recorded by Brad in the cold, unfinished, and rather noisy basement of his house, usually in spurts between the furnace turning on and off, and with recording equipment which was purchased approximately 3 weeks before we recorded, but which did not arrive until about a week prior to commencement. As a result, Brad had to learn the in’s and out’s of the programs rather rapidly. In order to compensate for that brief learning period, Brad relied heavily on his ears and the characteristics of the recording rooms to create a different tonal atmosphere for each track, which he felt was vitally important in capturing the personality differences present in each song.\nThe various album covers were composed Monday December 21, 2009. The photographs were taken by David Summers at Rogers Lakewood Park in Valparaiso, Indiana. In each, Vass is seen holding a different item. The first cover (green), Vass held a painting from his 2006 High School Art Show. The second cover (red), he held a piece of cardboard used in the shipping of our Untitled 7″. The third cover (blue), he held a 125 mesh count screen used to print a navy blue La Dispute hoodie (it had a whale on it) from the fall of 2007. Vass then digitally manipulated David’s photos to exaggerate each of their color schemes and to add the necessary text.\nThanks, and be your best to everyone, no exceptions.\n-La Dispute\n*This download also includes album artwork, lyrics, and liner notes.",

            "about": "\"Searching for a Pulse/The Worth of the World\" is the musical and emotional convergence of two groups of close friends who, while from entirely different locations and backgrounds, share a common passion for creating honest art that seeks to explore the deeper aspects of every day existence. In particular, the songs on either side of this record discuss thematically the sometimes crippling mediocrity of day-to-day life, paying special attention to the effect environment has on self while attempting to reconcile feelings of discontent in the face of self-doubt. Musically, the 7\" represents a new approach for both bands, who, in an attempt to add aesthetic continuity to the lyrical concept, focused on finding musical middle ground with the other--a process that forced both bands into new creative territories and added a consistency uncharacteristic of most splits. The end result is a 4-song collaborative examination of life, two musical snapshots from two very different cities that each show the same lingering uncertainty present everywhere, and a challenge to the creative process. This release was recorded during similar time periods both in Los Angeles and in New York and features collaborative digital and hand-drawn artwork from La Dispute's Adam Vass and Touche Amore's Nick Steinhardt, as well as vocal collaborations between each band's vocalists.",

            "about": "La Dispute spent roughly a year of its existence writing and recording their first full length album, called \"Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair,\" in hopes of accurately displaying their growth both as individuals and as a single artistic unit while creating an end product that encourages the listener to both think and feel. Drawing its title from an Asian folktale, \"Somewhere\" attempts to prompt discussion regarding the aspects of ourselves that prevent us from maintaining our happiness as people by documenting both their own experiences in the matter and the experiences of those around them, while musically encouraging the listener to expand their notions of music and art by exploring time signatures, tempos, dynamics, song structures, etc. The result of countless sleepless nights, exhaustingly precise recording sessions, and a diligence bordering psychosis, \"Somewhere\" is far and a way the bands most mature, articulate, and diverse release thus far expanding significantly upon the groundwork from its previous two short releases. Recorded at Studiotte in Grand Rapids by Joel and Troy Otte with artwork by Nick Satinover, \"Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair\" attempts to display an unceasing passion for art, emotion, love, community, and any other aspect of life that similarly inspires humanity to create for the better.",

            "about": "La Dispute’s biting debut full length ‘Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair’ is the culmination of sleepless nights and exhausting recording sessions. It was the product of a young band with an unyielding persistence that bordered on outright psychosis. As a result, the frantic guitar, unexpected time signatures and emotive vocal work has stood the test of time and remained an influence across the post-hardcore and emo scenes. To mark 10 years since it’s inception, No Sleep will be releasing an entirely new version of the anthemic album which remains a huge part of the label’s on-going success.\n‘Somewhere at the Bottom..’ may be the same record cemented in post-hardcore history, but it’s also been completely revamped. The LP was taken to Grammy-nominated recording vet Will Yip (Code Orange, The Menzingers, Circa Survive) who re-amped the guitars from the original recording files, features a new mix Dave Schiffman (Thrice, Charlie XCX, Trash Talk) and was then mastered by Emily Lazar (Coldplay, Beck, Morrissey). The 10 year retrospective also comes with re-imagined artwork by Corey Purvis to give fans a nostalgia bomb that somehow feels like a brand-new classic. Somewhere at the Bottom's retelling captures the same captivating, hectic stories fans fell in love with 10 years ago all with a shiny new coat of paint.",
            "credits": "released November 9, 2018\nGuitars re-amped by Will Yip and Chad Morgan-Sterenberg\nMixed by Dave Schiffman\nMastered by Emily Lazar at The Lodge, NY (Assisted by Chris Allgood)\nReimagined cover art by Corey Purvis.",

            "about": "We spent our first off day last tour (November 21st, 2019) home away from home at Studio 4 in Conshohocken, PA playing songs in the live room while an old friend tracked and new friends filmed. Been nearly a decade since we’d played in front of cameras without an audience so it took a second to feel comfortable, but there was some fog at least to obscure us slightly and, of course, it was just playing music in a room with good people, which is the goal so, you know—we had a blast. Big, big love and gratitude to Mr. William Yip for recording and mixing and for letting us in the door again, to the amazing Michael Parks Randa and his wonderful team for coming out to shoot and edit and make us feel at ease the whole way, and to Anays and Kirk for helping play the songs with us.\nTracklist:\nFOOTSTEPS AT THE POND\nRHODONITE AND GRIEF\nVIEW FROM OUR BEDROOM WINDOW\nEngineer\nWill Yip\nMusic\nAdam Vass - bass\nBradley Vander Lugt - drums\nChad Morgan-Sterenberg - guitar & trumpet\nCorey Stroffolino - guitar\nJordan Dreyer - vocals & tambourine\nKirk Harrington - percussion\nAnays Torres - guitar",
