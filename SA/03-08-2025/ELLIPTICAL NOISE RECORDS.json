            "about": "3LP set released by Opax Records. Includes DL coupon of entire set.\n\"[...] subtly blooming tone fields that build to the kind of beautifully vibrating monoliths that would reconcile the percussive American fantasias of Harry Partch and Moondog with the gravity devouring industrial force of Kluster. Repeating tones give the set the feel of a heady modern minimalist working but with a klanging Neubauten edge, with ringing tones and voids of blistering feedback suspended over deep pools of pitch black electricity. Long, multi-movement tracks allow for full tonal immersion.\nSet the controls for the heart of the sun! Highly recommended.\"\n- DAVID KEENAN\n\"[...] across the six sides ‘Abstract Expressionism For The Ears’ finds these sound art titans sparring to craft an intoxicating listening experience that shifts and shimmers amid serenely snoozing glassy dream weaves to full on deep and heavy galactic dronal tidal which reference wise have them perched upon a sonic axis inhabited by all manner of woozy psychedelics, futurist soundtracks and meditative mosaics whilst simultaneously operating in out there minimalist left field boundary pushing frontiers.”\n- MARKLOSINGTODAY / The Sunday Experience",

            "about": "“Beautiful liminal soundtrack work from the Opalio brothers, originally scored to accompany Roberto Opalio’s Alien Blood film that was shown as part of the Sonic Youth: Sensational Fix museum exhibition in an art edition of only 220 copies: a heady, nocturnal trip from MCIAA with distant pin-pricks of light singing beyond the horizon like orchestras of tiny angelic insects. Very minimal weeping single note guitar reveries that come over like an emotionally catatonic Loren Connors give way to choruses of shimmering cymbal work and subtle almost-Nurse With Wound style automating small instrument sci-fi. The piece builds and expands with smaller gestures and F/X modulated percussive tattoos giving it the feel of a Harry Partch or Harry Bertoia sound sculpture, slowly spinning in space, as single notes flicker like lonely satellites and bright constellations pulse in the mouth of soft, droning tunnels of heavenly reverb. One of the most eerily beautiful MCIAA releases in art paper sleeves with paste on art and insert. Comes with a download, recommended.”\n- DAVID KEENAN",

            "about": "ORIGINALLY RELEASED AS 3 CD BOX\n'ALIENACUSTICA' is a superb collection of works by Maurizio and Roberto Opalio (My Cat Is An Alien) as you have never heard before. Forget all MCIAA's noise records... this is a totally different affair: starting from January 2006 they have released 3 unusual, completely acoustic works, all in limited and sold-out editions: a soloist split lp, a private art edition cd-r, and an out-of-print cd. The different approach to these works shows another side of the Opalio brothers' musical universe: all of the electric guitars and electronic effects that have been characterizing My Cat Is An Alien from the beginning are here left aside to give space to classical and acoustic guitar strings, and to Roberto's \"human\" voice as a primordial instrument.\nIndeed, they decided to collect these precious gems under the pseudonym of BROTHERS FROM ANOTHER SPACE, so to point out how much these works are \"alien\" to the rest of their immense corpus of work.\nWithin this triple box set it reigns the celestial harmony of the same matter their beloved Western Alps are made of, as it comes out from the recordings themselves (most of which made in Spring), sometimes hiding the surrounding nature's sounds, like birds singing through the leafy branches of the trees outside the brothers' Alien Zone studio, as well as the creaking of their HQs' wood floor echoing inside their acoustic guitar bodies, the whole creating a really unique atmosphere.\nDISC 1 - ROBERTO OPALIO / MAURIZIO OPALIO 'In The Middle Of The Air / Glacier Sommeiller'\nDISC 2 - MAURIZIO & ROBERTO OPALIO 'Liquid Spring'\nDISC 3 - MY CAT IS AN ALIEN 'Folclore Alieno'",

            "about": "10 CD BOX SET\nStunning collection of works from 1998 to 2008, MY CAT IS AN ALIEN's first decade of adventure in outer space and modern music. All ultra-rare and long-out-of-print material from space brothers Maurizio and Roberto Opalio finally available for the first time in digital format, including a previously unreleased gem entitled 'Where The Lines Go To Sleep' (2004).\nThe selection starts from MY CAT IS AN ALIEN's 1999 first milestone 'Landscapes Of An Electric City' (originally spread throughout the world by Thurston Moore's Ecstatic Peace!). In these early years, MY CAT IS AN ALIEN decided to entrust thier own 'pictures of infinity' to several obscure labels specialized in producing limited as well as specially curated vinyl-only releases (not to mention the duo's own Opax Records imprint), thus creating a monumental corpus of work that gave birth to the brothers' myth.\nAmong many other fundamental works, this huge set also contains what MY CAT IS AN ALIEN have called 'The Great Void Trilogy', which was originally released on three separate LPs by Ed Hardy's legendary Eclipse Records in the middle of the last decade. The latest work presented in the set is 'Alien Blood' (2008), original soundtrack to the homonimous film by Roberto Opalio, which was shown at various European museums as part of the 'SONIC YOUTH etc: Sensational Fix' touring exhibition.\nEach work has been accurately remastered and re-edited appositely for this box set release. The box also includes extensive liner notes, plus special art cards.\nA unique occasion for every adventurous listener to experience some of the most inscrutable and essential music of all times.",

            "credits": "released December 7, 2018\nExcerpts from BYRON COLEY's liner booklet :\n\"The 2006 edition of ATP's Nightmare Before Christmas festival was one of the signal events of the early 21st Century. Curated by Thurston Moore, held at the Butlin Holiday camp in Mineshead, England from the 8th to the 10th of December, the line-up was almost beyond belief.\n[..] This Sunday dinnertime concert at Red's was the first time I'd gotten to see a live show by MCIAA, whose music I knew from their most excellent records, tapes, CDRs and whatnot. They did not disappoint.\nPlaying instruments I could not quite make out in the murky light (at least partly because apart from a guitar, they didn't really seem to look like many instruments I'd seen before), the Opalio brothers began their set with what sounded like emptying a vacuum cleaner full of locusts into a small swimming pool filled with percussion instruments and a choir of dentists. These sounds seemed to emanate from boxes and a tableful of stuff, and that guitar I mentioned. Although when I listen back to the tape of the show, I still get confused trying to pick up and identify sounds in the mix. I mean, were there really horns and that many bells?\nHaving seen MCIAA subsequently, and more soberly, I can report that my confusion was probably a bit unwarranted. I mean, these guys can come on stage with just two thimbles and turn it into a cosmic hurricane. A lot of what they do just emanates from their bodies. [..] those Opalio boys... I dunno what the fuck it is they eat. But music comes out of them in gusts.\nAnd on this night, on the South West coast of England, amidst one of the finest musical events organized in the history of sound, they were gusting like goddamn monsters. It was pretty fucking nuts.\nAs the brothers have been heard to say, \"Our wildest show ever, in the wildest festival ever!\"\nNo argument.\"\n- BYRON COLEY, 2018\nOut February 1st, 2019 on Feeding Tube Records (USA) - FTR390 LP",

The first is a beautiful slice of ghostly holy music made using nothing but glockenspiel fed through his patented ‘alientronics’. [..] Alternately meditative and mind-breakingly harsh, this is a major statement of modern minimalism.\nThe second piece, “Hic et Nunc”, applies the same cracked alientronics to vocals, with tunnels of disembodied angel vox flexing deep bass tones and hovering register leaps to the point of pure body ecstasy. [..]\nA major release, this one comes very highly recommended!\n- DAVID KEENAN / Volcanic Tongue\n[...] Comprising two elongated suites this set promises an experience like no other, applying his self-patented alientronics software and glockenspiels, Mr Opalio etches to wax what the press blurb describes as ’ghostly holy music’.

'Black Shadows from Jupiter, Volume I' was indeed issued in 2005 as one of the legendary and ultra-rare, private vinyl editions by Opalio brothers' own Opax Records imprint, pressed in 120 copies in 'Monalien Fidelity' - a clear reference/tribute to ESP's incredible 'monaural' sound recordings. Volume One consists of two long tracks, the very first music recorded by MCIAA after they moved to the new recording space located in the Western Alps, as well as the first experiments in Roberto Opalio's personal technique in the use of wordless vocals as a powerful musical instrument, which has since become one of the most original and distinctive elements of MCIAA's music, and that here can't but recall Tim Buckley's 'Starsailor' mood. Five years later, in October 2009, MCIAA decide to record almost one hour of completely new material to represent the follow-up, 'Black Shadows from Jupiter, Volume II', here all featured in Disc 2.

            "about": "> ETERNAL BEYOND > is a collaborative project set up by brothers Maurizio and Roberto Opalio aka MY CAT IS AN ALIEN (MCIAA) and JOËLLE VINCIARELLI (Talweg, La Morte Young). All began in Spring 2015, when outsider instantaneous composers MCIAA traced a new magic triangle on a map between their hometown Torino, their current “Alien Zone” secret base in Western Alps, and the mysterious area over Nice’s hills known as Le Village Nègre. Not far from there, in the small and private recording studio of French underground queen Joëlle Vinciarelli, MCIAA recorded and produced a long session of instantaneous compositions where the duo’s otherwordly sounds and Roberto’s eerie wordless vocals melted with Vinciarelli’s unique, underwordly voice. An antique upright piano soundboard, self-made wooden string instruments, modified electronic devices, an old pendulum clock mechanism, bells and an old trumpet were played during the 4-day recording session. The result, purposely bypassing the present, builds a bridge between the archaic and the future, leading the way to what can only be defined as a groundbreaking > ETERNAL BEYOND >.",

            "about": "Chapter II in the ongoing, electroshock project > ETERNAL BEYOND > carried out by My Cat Is An Alien and Joëlle Vinciarelli. > ETERNAL BEYOND > proudly fights to act as a dangerous, conspirative unit escaping all radars of our GPS-controlled society, re-affirming once again the total freedom of its unique music and vision. This second release demonstrates how much the partnership between the two space-brothers Maurizio and Roberto Opalio and the “French queen of grunt” Joëlle Vinciarelli (Talweg, La Morte Young) is growing stronger and stronger, following uniquely their own language. The trio deliberately imposes upon itself a self-exile over the edge of the sub-underground, since today the foundation of the so-called “underground music” has been corrupted for the sake of mere mystification and sneaky business. > ETERNAL BEYOND > fights for Authenticity against Emptiness.\nThus, take all your well-known notions of avant-garde, experimental music, noise, free jazz, drone, raga, minimalism, maximalism, primitive folk, ancient ritual music, ethnic sacred chants, total improvisation: shake them all together… and then thrash it all! > ETERNAL BEYOND > is “The New Thing” of tomorrow, “The New Unknown”.\nThe two instantaneous compositions have been recorded at Joëlle Vinciarelli’s private studio located in the hearth of French Maritime Alps, at the foot of the esoteric Village Nègre at Col de Vence, a labyrinth made of rock formations tortured into evocative shapes inhabited by arcane spirits, well represented by the “alienanthropomorphous” stone picked up on-site and showed in Roberto Opalio’s hands on the record cover. The trio plays modified or self-built acoustic and electric instruments and devices, in addition to an antique upright piano soundboard and a pendulum clock mechanism from the beginning of the 20th century (“> ETERNAL ECTOPLASMIC COMMUNICATION >”). Roberto Opalio and Joëlle Vinciarelli’s braided wordless vocals aren’t but \"Angels and Demons at play\". Also, while Roberto Opalio paid tribute to William Blake in a title from the first album, here he pays homage to Dylan Thomas’ poem “Do Not Go Gentle into That Good Night” in the long, epic track “> ETERNAL RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT >”, bringing on the inextricable passion for literature and poetry.\nThe record comes out in marble red purple color vinyl in hand-pasted jackets, limited to 100 hand-numbered copies only, 'cause as affirmed by the \"wanted-dead-or-alive\" Opalio brothers (MCIAA) \"we're all living the Middle Age of 21st Century and people who do really look for the real new thing must act fast and grab art before too late!\"\nREVIEWS:\n[..] I am absolutely thrilled to report that this trio has now become a recurring project and that > ETERNAL BEYOND > II is every good as its predecessor (if not even better).\n[..] the improbable collision of Vinciarelli’s \"Cro-Magnon grunt and cultic energies\" with the Opalios’ mind-melting, deep space lysergia is a perfect, unholy union, enhancing the brothers’ smeared and disorienting psychedelia with a healthy dose of seismic, elemental power.\n[..] It is truly impressive that Maurizio and Roberto managed to unleash such an apocalyptic cacophony in real-time, as the crescendo of \"> Eternal Rage (Against The Dying Of The Light) >\" sounds like a heaving maelstrom of countless rusted steel strings being viciously attacked at once.\n[..] Unsurprisingly, those ingredients make for quite a potent cocktail and \"> Eternal Rage >\" easily ranks among the best MCIAA pieces in recent memory.\n[..] with > ETERNAL BEYOND > II, the Opalios and Vinciarelli evoke something significantly different that I cannot find anywhere else: the singular collision of the imagined past versus the imagined future, the spectral versus the corporeal, and flesh-and-blood humanity versus the unknowable, abstract vastness of the cosmos.\n- ANTHONY D'AMICO - BRAINWASHED MAGAZINE (USA)\nFULL REVIEW HERE:\nbrainwashed.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12321:2020-03-29-13-45-16&catid=13:albums-and-singles&Itemid=133",

My Cat Is An Alien & Joëlle Vinciarelli's > ETERNAL BEYOND > III is the final chapter of a Trilogy born in spring 2015. Whether this might mean the end or a new beginning, we can not know.\nBased on a vision of radical and spontaneous free improvisation which the Opalio brothers have pushed to the extreme along their 23 years of tireless activity as MCIAA, the project with Joëlle Vinciarelli has immediately revealed as a key encounter, both artistically and personally.\nThe two instantaneous compositions have been recorded at Joëlle Vinciarelli’s private studio located in the hearth of French Maritime Alps, at the foot of the esoteric Village Nègre at Col de Vence, a labyrinth made of rock formations tortured into evocative shapes inhabited by arcane spirits, well represented by the “alienanthropomorphous” stone picked up on-site and showed in Roberto Opalio’s hands on the record cover. A mystic place which inspired outsider artist Jean Dubuffet and painter Hans Hartung.\n> ETERNAL BEYOND > tracks’ titles often paid tribute to figures of artists, poets, musicians and outsiders such as Albert Ayler, William Blake, Dylan Thomas, Art Ensemble Of Chicago… Here the clairvoyant title concluding the Trilogy is > ETERNAL ÉTERNITÉ > , an homage to poet Arthur Rimbaud:\n“It has been found again.\nWhat? – Eternity.\nIt is the sea fled away\nWith the sun.” - A.Rimbaud",

            "about": "“New art edition of this excellent studio album from the Opalio Brothers w/handmade sleeves, paste-on artwork and coloured vinyl: more acid folk than much of the MCIAA corpus, Fragments… features the Opalios on acoustic and electric guitar, F/X, mini keyboard and wordless vocalisations. The beautiful, delicate arpeggios seem to come out of the whole dosed/Laurel Canyon scene, just endlessly delicate, soft tumbling melodies that dance in melancholy reverie and that have the accumulative effect of pure tone hypnosis, existing almost on the periphery of sound and working best when played at a low, almost subliminal level where it has the power to transform and transport the immediate environment. Hard to describe just how oddly affecting this piece is, just very small, subtle repeat-melodic gestures, almost like a more heavenly, candyfloss Fripp & Eno but it is genuinely beautiful and makes for the sort of music you could live in forever. A major MCIAA one-off, comes with a download, very highly recommended!”\n- DAVID KEENAN",

            "about": "ORIGINALLY RELEASED AS 3 CD BOX\nThis is the official debut of the Opalio brothers' new project called MUSIC FOR PHANTOMS. It is a totally acoustic and a very ambitious project dedicated to \"total quietness\", recorded in the mountains and ONLY during the night. This is the most haunted music you can ever imagine, created playing exclusively wooden instruments: a classical guitar, and an acoustic guitar; all instrumental. This music makes you taste the distant echoes coming from the other side. Nothing can be more true. In November 2007 Maurizio and Roberto Opalio released the first album of this collection (entitled 'I') as a private press art edition cd-r of only 99 copies. On April 28 and July 20, 2010, they recorded the following two albums ('II' and 'III'), presented for the first time in this triple box set.\n\"music for phantoms is the thin curtain which permeates your neurons_music for phantoms is the numbness of the fog that holds you with its silver fluxes_music for phantoms is the whisper of the promised first snow_music for phantoms is the atonal sing-song of the branches soaked with memory reverbered by the wind_music for phantoms is the view through the praxinoscope of the Great Void_music for phantoms is the murmur of the golden leaves stripped by the agony of the autumn sun_music for phantoms is the pure vivid white light that exists as such and does not mind to show its necessity to the world_music for phantoms is everything that shines beyond space and time_music for phantoms is the shadow of the instant just sacrified in its becoming_music for phantoms is the consciousness of the senselessness of what comes afterwards_music for phantoms is the limbo between this and the other dimension_music for phantoms is the blinding darkness coming from a dying flame and a new light not yet discernible on an increasingly undefined horizon\" - Roberto Opalio (Music For Phantoms manifesto, 2007)\n\"Another rewarding sonic step into new territory from the Opalio brothers. Superb and atmospheric, a pagan ceremony to welcome winter in a forest, dancing between the unknown strange states of mind, haunted and compelling through out\" (Musique Machine)",

            "credits": "released December 6, 2019\nOn September 12, 2018 Sonic Youth co-founder Lee Ranaldo and guitarist extraordinaire Jean-Marc Montera joined Maurizio and Roberto Opalio in their hometown Torino, Italy, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the brothers’ visionary project My Cat Is An Alien. That evening the stage of Alfa Teatro—a liberty-style, historical theater built in 1928—hosted the live world premiere of this quartet, whose members already collaborated live and on records with each other during the years, yet never all the four together. The quartet live performance followed MCIAA’s radical aesthetic of “instantaneous composition”, where nothing is defined nor drafted prior to the act of music creation, and every sound and action is shaped around a higher-order scheme dictated by the empathy and synergy of the actual moment of enlightenment. The show was also accompanied by the projection of a brand new cinematic poetry dual film created by Roberto Opalio and previewed on the occasion, whose Super-8 film’s relentless flickering and ascending motion worked “ad hoc” to match the music and body gestures of the performance, thus enhancing its transcendental power.\nThat night Maurizio Opalio (self-made double-bodied wooden string instrument, pedal effects, bell), Roberto Opalio (wordless vocalizations, bodhran, Alientronics, electric guitar, space toys), Jean-Marc Montera (table top guitar, pedals, little gong), and Lee Ranaldo (vocals, electric guitar, bells) moved through still unexplored and unheard music territories.\nThis music is a pure ecstatic revelation, a unique, powerful and spiritual experience all of its own. Listening to this album we are offered a true epiphany as just uniquely gifted genius improvisers/composers of the past would grace our ears and souls.",

            "about": "The global madness which is ravaging this \"new\" world seems to call out loud the need for the strong poetics behind My Cat Is An Alien’s peculiar project called MUSIC FOR PHANTOMS, whose last release dates back to 12 years ago as a triple box set published by Elliptical Noise Records.\nMUSIC FOR PHANTOMS (IV) has been recorded in the middle of the night at MCIAA’s HQ in the Western Alps with only 2 glockenspiels, wordless vocals and a single condenser microphone to capture the essence of the screaming silence. The instantaneously composed music manifests itself as a sparkling distillate of pure poetry in an ocean of iridescent silence and estranging analog morphologies.\nIn the deepest heart of the night, in those hours that belong to the dimension inhabited by the spirits, in the same instants sealed by a silence so clear that it becomes deafening noise, every single note of the glockenspiels whispers the words of the solitary souls that emerge from the darkness like traces of shooting stars. In this perspective, MCIAA immortalized on Polaroid Duochrome films yellow dots of their light installation dragged on the snowy mantle under the night sky.\nMUSIC FOR PHANTOMS is the symbol of a urgent, poetic vision: a “light” that does not yet intend to fade away.\n- - - - - - - - -\n\"music for phantoms is the thin curtain which permeates your neurons_music for phantoms is the numbness of the fog that holds you with its silver fluxes_music for phantoms is the whisper of the promised first snow_music for phantoms is the atonal sing-song of the branches soaked with memory reverbered by the wind_music for phantoms is the view through the praxinoscope of the Great Void_music for phantoms is the murmur of the golden leaves stripped by the agony of the autumn sun_music for phantoms is the pure vivid white light that exists as such and does not mind to show its necessity to the world_music for phantoms is everything that shines beyond space and time_music for phantoms is the shadow of the instant just sacrified in its becoming_music for phantoms is the consciousness of the senselessness of what comes afterwards_music for phantoms is the limbo between this and the other dimension_music for phantoms is the blinding darkness coming from a dying flame and a new light not yet discernible on an increasingly undefined horizon\" - Roberto Opalio (Music For Phantoms manifesto, 2007)",

            "about": "It was on a winter’s night ('Nuit d'Hiver' indeed) five days before Christmas 2018, when My Cat Is An Alien and Jean-Marc Montera joined on stage to perform for the second time as a trio, proving once again their heavenly graced and powerful music-mind-soul connection. As it happened at their very first live encounter in 2015 (released by San Francisco cult label Starlight Furniture Co. under the title 'Union Of The Supreme Light' in 2017), \"Before jumping on stage NO word was spoken about the concert we were going to play, nor even trying to figure out any sort of basic music scheme to be followed\" recalls Roberto Opalio.\nIn 2018, at the opening of the final edition of the REEVOX-NUIT D’HIVER festival at GMEM inside the restored industrial complex of La Friche La Belle de Mai in Marseille, the spaceship-like dome of Le Module shook like never before. ‘Nuit d’Hiver’ is a true musical hurricane of radical free jazz and “Spiritual Noise”. Such a gifted performance could only be blessed by immortal spirits like Cecyl Taylor, Sonny Sharrock, Albert Ayler, Ornette Coleman… an otherwordly Titans’ “beauty of the fury”!\nBrothers Maurizio and Roberto Opalio, aka MCIAA, are world-renowned for their radical aesthetics of “instantaneous composition”, their innate skill in creating articulated and ever-evolving improvisations that develop as they were proper written scores from beginning to end. The same approach occurs in every duo’s collaboration with other artists too—be they Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth, Italian electronic pioneer Enore Zaffiri or Hungarian avant-garde poet-performer Endre Szkarosi to name a few—as well as in whatever situation they might be invited to perform—including the opening of Venice Art Biennale or Milan Fashion Week.\nJean-Marc Montera is a revered guitar maestro whose skill in non-idiomatic improvisation surpasses the mastery of all his companions for his willing to explore new sonic territories instead of repeating classic formulas nowadays become too much \"academic\". Co-founder of GRIM (Groupe de Recherche et d’Improvisation Musicales) in 1978 and now associated artist of GMEM in Marseille, Montera debuted as soloist on legendary label FMP (Free Music Production); during the years he has collaborated with tons of free jazz and avant-garde musicians among which Famoudou Don Moye of Art Ensemble of Chicago, Fred Frith, Chris Cutler, Barre Phillips, Jean-François Pauvros, Pauline Oliveros and Christian Wolff, and has set up several groups specialized in the interpretation of graphic scores by 20th century composers (Cornelius Cardew, John Cage, Earle Brown..).\nProduced by MCIAA in their newly branded multi-dimensional, fully dynamics-frequency spectrum “STEROALIEN FIDELITY”, this LP will make your ears feel projected into an unexplored universe of sound.\nLimited private press edition of only 100 (!!!) clear emerald green color vinyls, co-released by MCIAA’s Opax Records and JM Montera’s The End mAde RecordS own imprints.\nMCIAA & JMM created a strongly conceptual and multi-sensorial work, an immersive music, visual and tactile experience: the uniqueness of each cover artwork introduces to the uniqueness of the infinite shades of music perception. Spin the vinyl, watch the cover, then close your eyes and move your fingers across the embossed/debossed signs as Braille-like reading while music permeates your room, your ears, your soul. Indeed all covers handmade one by one, with unique variations in colors and embossing/ debossing results.\nThe cover artwork comes from a hand etching on vinyl by Roberto & Maurizio Opalio, then completed by JM Montera who printed every single cover jacket using the ancient tecniques of French “gravure” (75 hand-numbered exemplars on white jackets) and “marouflage” (25 signed and hand-numbered exemplars on black jackets).\nBoth editions will probably be gone before you finish reading this shit!",

He indeed created the “alien cat” logo, My Cat Is An Alien’s trademark, which was initially hand sprayed on the handcrafted covers of MCIAA’s first ‘self-titled’ CD-R, then associated with the brothers’ own Opax Records private imprint, printed on posters and t-shirts, even used as subject of some of the duo’s artist books. Having been doing painting, glass art and photography for several years before MCIAA formed, his own works in visual art revealed a rich source of material to use as cover artworks of the band’s 200+ albums released worldwide so far. Especially, Roberto Opalio’s iconic figure of the “Alien”, “[..] a stick figure with widely extended arms and legs, its head a single sharply elliptical eye, permanently open and staring out at the universe that surrounds it [..]” (Ken Hollings / THE WIRE), symbolizing the transfiguration of the existential vision of the last human being on Earth, gets painted, drawn or sculpted in iron wire in most of his works, including his “cinematic poetry” films projected during MCIAA’s live performances. Photography had a great impact on MCIAA’s imaginary as well, Roberto capturing with b&w 35mm films, slides and Polaroids thousands of views of his hometown Turin’s industrial monuments of early 1900’s before politicians demolished almost everything–this is the reason why the cover of MCIAA’s ‘Landscapes Of An Electric City’ released by THURSTON MOORE on his Ecstatic Peace! label is now a prime example of “ghost cover”. Polaroids played a distinctive role also during the band’s live performances: Roberto’s ‘On-Stage Live Action Series’ art installations testimony hundreds of shots taken while playing his trademarked “space toys”, which he abandoned in 2012 for primitive, modified electronic devices called “alientronics”.\nWell known for his unique wordless vocalizations, his more sporadic spoken word poems reveal Roberto Opalio’s mastery in entitling all of MCIAA’s albums and pieces since the beginning. Roberto Opalio exhibited alongside artists such as MIKE KELLEY, RAYMOND PETTIBON, TONY CONRAD, JOHN CAGE, WILLIAM S. BURROUGHS, GERARD RICHTER to name a few. With his brother Maurizio he’s been under the radar of thousands of visitors during the opening days of the 57th VENICE ART BIENNALE in May 2017, when MCIAA activated the Studio Venezia project at the French Pavilion invited by artist XAVIER VEILHAN and curator CHRISTIAN MARCLAY.\n‘Once you'll touch the sky you will never return to dust’ is a new 1-hour long instantaneous composition performed with a prepared mini-keyboard, a handmade shortwave receiver and Roberto Opalio’s patented alientronics and wordless vocalizations. It is a masterpiece of modern minimalism, an ecstatic voyage where time and space lose their meaning, thus glorifying the poetic lyricism of the “here and now”, that “eternal now” that other visionary artists and vanguards of the past have always dealt with, from FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE to MUHAL RICHARD ABRAMS. “Towards the Sun”, headed ARTHUR RIMBAUD. “Space Is The Place”, asserted SUN RA.\nCD comes in full-color gatefold digisleeve. The not-compressed mastering devised by MCIAA provides a natural, immersive listening experience. Cover art features one of the most stunning paintings by Roberto Opalio, created just before the album was sent to the pressing plant. Artwork design by MCIAA.",

            "about": "THE STRANGE STRINGS ENSEMBLE\n(My Cat Is An Alien, Joëlle Vinciarelli, Philippe Robert)\nONE FOR RA is an instantaneous composition. The music is totally improvised. Total improvisation without any preconceived score or structure equals composition for us.\nONE FOR RA is dedicated to Sun Ra. In particular it’s a tribute to the album Sun-Ra and his Astro Infinity Arkestra “Strange Strings”, first released on his own Saturn label in 1967.\nWe all played a spontaneous composition performing ancient, mostly ethnic, acoustic string instruments from Vinciarelli’s vast collection. All instruments were completely “untuned”, thus following Sun Ra’s approach to that peculiar work—which he called “a study in ignorance”. The sounds are acoustic and no electronics are involved—except for a short, real-time looped vocal part. No use of overdubs nor outtakes.\nONE FOR RA has been performed at the end of some days of intense recording sessions for My Cat Is An Alien & Joëlle Vinciarelli’s project > ETERNAL BEYOND > . The idea came out the same day during a conversation with Philippe Robert, renowned music critic and writer as well as self-declared non-musician. Thus his involvement in the performance as fourth member of the group was even more exciting and challenging.\nListening to the final piece, the extreme cohesion of sound at times makes it difficult to be sure who was playing what. Yet that’s a further point to enter into the core of the composition. We highly suggest to the listener to forget there are four people on this recording and try to hear it as a whole. ONE FOR RA, indeed!\n--Maurizio & Roberto Opalio, Saturn, Solar System, March 2021\nNOTE: this record is also conceived as a sort of compendium to the book by My Cat Is An Alien & Philippe Robert “FREE JAZZ MANIFESTO” published by Lenka lente editions in April 2021.",

            "about": "*2023 reissue* *MCIAA 25th anniversary limited edition of 200 copies*\nThis new 2023 special reissue of My Cat Is An Alien’s landmark album \"RE-SI-STEN-ZA!\" is intended to open the brotherly duo’s 25th anniversary celebrations. Originally released in 2016, the work well represents the summa of MCIAA's music activity, from their early space toys-era to the latest self-made electronics and string instruments outputs. Featuring two long compositions, the album reaches 50 minutes of pure “Spiritual Noise”—the way Maurizio and Roberto Opalio have baptized their very own music. \"RE-SI-STEN-ZA!\" is the ideal bridge for the complete communion between noise and silence, a shamanic voyage from Alpha to Omega… and beyond.\n\"Metallic Gold Wax\" private edition limited to 200 copies only, featuring a brand new cover artwork by Roberto Opalio. Includes 2 double-page A4 inserts with full credits, lyrics, black&white old photographic reproductions and a foreword by Roberto Opalio. Entirely designed by MCIAA. Comes with full-album Digital Download collector's card.\nREVIEWS:\n\"The theme of resistance is one that has arguably shaped MCIAA’s entire career, as there are few other artists who have been so unwaveringly challenging and iconoclastic for as long as the Opalios. The average My Cat Is An Alien album has absolute zero common ground with anything happening in the mundane world of the masses, as Maurizio and Roberto seem to exclusively look to the stars or search inwardly for their inspirations instead.\n[...] Everyone already indoctrinated into My Cat Is An Alien’s singular vision already knows that this is an essential release, but it may very well be the perfect entry point for the curious as well..” – Anthony D’Amico / BRAINWASHED\n“One of the pair’s bolder and more free-spirited outings” – THE WIRE\n“RE-SI-STEN-ZA!” is a super limited two-track juggernaut […] The title track finds MCIAA at the height of their wiring and warping powers, an absolute wig flipped tour de force that sees them morphing through elements of noise, musique concrete, stoner earthbeat and cosmic spiritualism to craft out a truly immense and often brutal cranium collapsing palette of psychotropic goo which across 25 minutes of head tripping groove shapeshifts with such out there aplomb that you literally fear your mind might fry.” – Mark Barton (THE SUNDAY EXPERIENCE)\n“Opalio brothers have great array of means at their disposal - both in technical sense and in terms of their creative imagination which has no limits - it bears the resemblance of a creative spirit that the last decade of XXth century was made of and brought inventive combinations - a cross between the border. This beautifully published vinyl is a proof to that.” – FELTHATREVIEWS\n“La resistenza di cui al titolo non è solamente “quella” stagione storica; la resistenza per i MCIAA ha un significato esistenziale e poetico, come essi stessi scrivono. E si sente. Un disco che merita.” – KATHODIK",

            "about": "*** 5.5 HOURS OF PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED NEW MATERIAL ***\n- RINASCIMENTO (= RENAISSANCE)\n“Spiritual Noise___RINASCIMENTO” took an entire year of self-isolation in MCIAA's secret HQ called Alien Zone up in the Western Alps to be conceived and created -- between 2021 and 2022, in the midst of a reality still plagued by pandemic, we spent our lives discovering new existential meanings projected into the deepest core of still-unknown space-time dimensions -- flowing through the spiral of the atemporal secrets of space we found new reasons to survive -- a renewed power for our Alien Souls -- as MCIAA we see/feel the infinite ocean above our heads and we call it home -- MCIAA are Warriors of the Sun -- the Light is always with us -- leading the way -- we are used to shape the dark matter and transform it into new light-life-energy-self-consciousness -- yet this time we pushed ourselves till the ineffable/inscrutable Eye of the Eternal -- we had to re-set our Alien Minds to re-connect with the Present/Past/Future -- especially the Future -- RINASCIMENTO is 100% Future in Present --\n- WHY CD-R?\nThe choice of the CD-R format in this handcrafted box set is intended as self-tribute to MCIAA's origins -- furthermore, it is our act of revolt against the record industry imperialism of the last couple of years -- MCIAA started 25 years ago using CD-R as the most apt format to represent the radical DIY esthetics behind the project -- it was indeed an independent, cheap and ready-to-go-now way to express the urgency of our music-art -- thus, in early 1998, MCIAA’s discographic debut was a self-released CD-R housed in a totally handcrafted art jacket -- MCIAA have been among the first musicians on the globe to use CD-Rs in the era of the officially printed CDs -- and the very first in our terrestrial country called Italy, where MCIAA’s debut album was a shock -- many critics, writers, magazine editors, shops, distros and listeners were not ready to take in consideration this \"unofficial\" format -- but in the end we broke the wall: it was no more possible to ignore the so-called “alien CD-R attack”, aimed at destabilizing the music market / opening human minds -- crazy how, in just a couple of years, CD-R would have become “the messenger” of the most exciting, independent and sub-underground music scenes worldwide for an entire decade -- now, on the contrary, CD-R seems the most unwanted, neglected and banned format of this pseudo-post-covid era -- exactly for this reason MCIAA are giving CD-R a renewed life of DIY possibilities for art expression and political reaction -- MCIAA will always fight for the survival of music in any kind of physical format -- wish we could be once again of example to many independent musicians -- an artist can’t be stopped by any sneaky or trendy marketing influence / exploitation -- MCIAA have always been and always will be against the tide -- “immune to spiritual disruption” --\nThanks to all of you space travellers for supporting MCIAA’s 25 years of ever-expanding aliencentric Vision --\nAlien Power + Spiritual Noise!------------Maurizio & Roberto Opalio, 2023",
            "credits": "released March 23, 2023\nREVIEWS:\n\"RINASCIMENTO is one hell of a statement. [...] Landmark MCIAA releases like this one are objectively as forward-thinking as many previous innovations that have provocatively challenged the way that people understand, experience, and appreciate organized sound (such as Just Intonation, chromaticism, John Cage's use of the I Ching, or the birth of noise).\"\n- Anthony D'Amico / BRAINWASHED\n>> full review here:  brainwashed.com/index.php/reviews-easyblog/my-cat-is-an-alien-spiritual-noise-rinascimento\n\"It has been 25 years since this fraternal Italian duo began recording as My Cat Is An Alien and a dozen years since they were Wire cover stars. In honour of these anniversaries, Roberto and Maurizio Opalio have put together this insanely overwhelming art piece featuring almost six hours of music, a poster, an art catalogue and a historical manifesto, all cooked up during the pandemic at their secret headquarters in the Italian Alps.\nThey chose the CD-R as the format for this masterwork because CD-Rs remains a revolutionary anti-industry format through which almost anyone can get their music out to the world in a tactile way. Each of the discs contains a single piece of music, ranging from six to 40 minutes, and everything was recorded during 2021–22. The material is varied as hell, employing the exotic range of homemade (or home-altered) instruments MCIAA have been using as their primary voice for the last decade.\nThe music on these discs is a wonderful example of the spiritual space noise the Opalios have made their stock in trade. The vocals float like teapots full of secrets amid music that ranges from noisily machined circular electric guitar to massed percussing bells to subliminal messages via drumming to tape looped babbling to keys based whistling outer space doughnuts to subterranean pulse rumbles to Incan flute surgery to amplified jaw harp zonking and onward. Some of the pieces are fairly obtuse, others are quite beautiful by any standard.\nI have heard some squares complain that MCIAA’s music is too loose – but what they play is not generally about linear structure. Their goal is not to script musical narratives, so much as to invent individual musical environments listeners can experience either individually or sequentially. If people wish to assemble and appreciate these discrete segments as though they told a story, that’s cool, but it’s not an inherent function of the music.\nSince they first appeared, the Opalios have focused their energy largely on spaced out abstractions in a variety of media. Their music, writing, visual art and countless collaborations all explore different iterations of noise and the alien qualities that are always part of creating work from a personal template, rather than following someone else’s prefab notions. Anyone who is open to zoned avant garde weirdness (MCIAA’s music doesn't fall into any one neat genre) will find a lot of amazing sounds in this box. The duo have a very friendly way of presenting difficult material. I’ve played my way through these 15 CD-Rs thrice thus far, and they have really been blissing me out on these hot summer days.\nI do wish I had enough spare time to gobble some acid, which I think might make the music sound even better. But I’m on deadline, y’know? You, on the other hand, are not on deadline. If you get my drift.\"\n- BYRON COLEY / THE WIRE\nALBUM CREDITS:\n= = = = =\nNOTE: MCIAA's assertion that each sound claims its own space is here extended to each individual piece of music, which has therefore been isolated in a disc entirely dedicated to it; thus the tracklisting is also intended for the listener to subvert the order, in case making use of random/chance operation à la Cage. However, each piece should not be considered except as a function of the whole work, conceived as an ever-expanding, psycho-sensory organic system.\n= = = = =\nMaurizio Opalio – self-made double-bodied string instrument, pedal effects; snare drum, floor tom, cymbals, bell cymbal, real-time percussion loops & effects (6,9); washing machine drum (13)\nRoberto Opalio – wordless vocalizations, alientronics, pedal effects, modified analog drum machine; cymbals & ball chains (6); bodhran (3); washing machine drum, real-time bodhran loops (13)\nAll instantaneous compositions performed, recorded and mixed by MCIAA at their secret Alien Zone studio in the Western Alps, over a one-year period between 2021 and 2022.\nMastering by Fabrizio Ronco.\nProduced by MCIAA in multi-dimensional, full dynamics-frequency spectrum \"STEREOALIEN FIDELITY\".\nHandcrafted box & inserts: concept & design by MCIAA.\nCover art, poster & book: collaborative artworks by Maurizio & Roberto Opalio.\nDiscs’ onbody: permanent ink pencil interventions by Maurizio & Roberto Opalio.\nMCIAA portrait: Polaroid black-and-white film by Roberto Opalio.\nArtist’s book co-published by Opax and Divinités Irritées.\nBox handstamped and handnumbered 1/199 on back.\nAll music & art © 2023 My Cat Is An Alien.

In honour of these anniversaries, Roberto and Mauricio Opalio have put together this insanely overwhelming art piece [..] Since they first appeared, the Opalios have focused their energy largely on spaced out abstractions in a variety of media. Their music, writing, visual art and countless collaborations all explore different iterations of noise and the alien qualities that are always part of creating work from a personal template, rather than following someone else’s prefab notions”\n-----\nPRESS RELEASE:\nAfter a 4-year hiatus, Antigravitational Records celebrates its return with a stunning new chapter in the ongoing series dedicated to My Cat Is An Alien's \"Spiritual Noise\" music and multimedia art experience in the 25th anniversary year of the Opalio brothers' project. Following the distinctive trademark of Antigravitational's serial jackets concept and design, this Red Marble Colored vinyl LP comes with a proper 24-page Art Book mounted on front cover. Made up of full-color immersive photographic details of a mix media painting by Roberto Opalio, the artbook includes QR codes to access free download & streaming of full album, the artbook in PDF format, as well as extra multimedia contents including an exclusive \"cinematic poetry film\" appositely created by the artist.\nAntigravitational is the multimedia imprint created and curated by iconoclastic instantaneous composers, musicians, performers and visual artists Maurizio and Roberto Opalio, aka My Cat Is An Alien (MCIAA), set up in collaboration with gallerist, editor and publisher Marco Contini (Galleria Contact Artecontemporanea, Edizioni Kappabit).\nFully focused on MCIAA’s \"aliencentric\" vision, Antigravitational’s main purpose is to offer the experience of the deepest immersion in the sound and visual matter of each work of intermedia art by the brothers–as duo, as soloists, as well as in collaborations with some of the most talented artists of our time.\nPursuing their ongoing fight against the digital-only fruition of concepts and contents of today, MCIAA privilege tactile mediums to fix and represent their art, aiming to survive the non-permanence over time.\n\"MCIAA PHASE THREE — WE BAPTIZE THE SPIRITUAL NOISE\" reads Roberto Opalio’s aesthetics Manifesto. Indeed, back in 2019, \"Spiritual Noise\" has opened the third decade of activity by the fraternal duo and this \"NEW VERB\" is now more than ever their \"MUSIC-ART-POETRY\" mission of life.\n\"Spiritual Noise ___ Ritual Of Spiritual Rebirth\" contains two full-side long tracks, both instantaneous compositions recorded at MCIAA's secret Alien Zone headquarters and studio up in the Western Alps during pandemics in 2021. Imbued with deep mysticism and shamanic power, the album's two pieces represent the most inexplicable and enlightening experience of psychic and physical dislocation in space-time, a proper \"antigravitational\" immersion in the mysterious sonic matter that has always distinguished My Cat Is An Alien's \"aliencentric\" universe, light years away from any musical reference whatsoever.\nIn order to enhance this extraterrestrial sensory experience, the entire record was produced by the Opalio brothers in their own multi-dimensional, full dynamics-frequency spectrum \"STEREOALIEN FIDELITY\", and the finest vinyl compound has been used for pressing.",

            "about": "NEW My Cat Is An Alien studio double album!\nFrom the extended foreword insert by David Keenan: \"The central fact of MCIAA’s music has always been space but they have never sounded quite so far away, so removed. [...] The music is extremely sensual. The rhythms have a contrary cold/organic quality to them, the feel of the pulse as the breath is held, but soon even that dies down and we are left with an extended, timeless moment, the space between one breath and the next. Occasionally there is the sound of strings, strange steel resonances that populate the music like ghosts, the ghosts of Roscoe Holcomb’s high, lonesome sound, of Dock Boggs and the sanctified steel of Washington Phillips. Ash Ra Tempel met Timothy Leary in the Alps [...] The transmissions are fuzzy up here and at points it makes for a music of almost terrifying quiet. It is minimal, sure, but MCIAA are not so much interested in repetition as in eternal expansion. [...] The Dance Of Oneirism is a music of unknowing, a dance with a phantom, the letting go of a dream. It is MCIAA’s greatest long form work. It has tributaries that run deep into the past, ghost channels that facilitate two-way travel, even as its destination, in the words of the late Conrad Schnitzler, is determinedly future, future, future.\" - DAVID KEENAN",

            "about": "TRACKLIST:\nLP1\n*Coral Pink Silver Marble Color LP*\nMY CAT IS AN ALIEN & TALWEG\nSide A: 'The Secret of the Space Bubble' (21:25)\nLP2\n*Marigold Silver Marble Color LP*\nMY CAT IS AN ALIEN & JOËLLE VINCIARELLI > ETERNAL BEYOND > IV\nSide A: > Eternal Ecstasy of the End > (17:40)\nDouble Single-Sided Art LP featuring the 4th and most intense episode of > ETERNAL BEYOND > (the trio project of My Cat Is An Alien & Joëlle Vinciarelli) alongside the shocking collaborative debut between MCIAA & French cult duo TALWEG (Joëlle V. & Eric Lombaert of La Morte Young). Each project fits the entire Side A of two dedicated vinyl LPs with different and distinctive colors.\nThe instantaneous compositions of both projects were recorded at Joëlle Vinciarelli’s private studio located in the hearth of French Maritime Alps, at the foot of the esoteric Village Nègre at Col de Vence, a labyrinth made of rock formations tortured into evocative shapes inhabited by arcane spirits, well represented by the “alienanthropomorphous” stone picked up on-site and showed in Roberto Opalio’s hands on the covers of > ETERNAL BEYOND > trilogy of records (‘I’, ‘II’, ‘III’). A mystic place which inspired outsider artist Jean Dubuffet and painter Hans Hartung.\nOn LP1 the conception of MY CAT IS AN ALIEN & TALWEG side-long music piece “The Secret of the Space Bubble” comes out of a vision by Roberto Opalio based on an unorthodox mix of delay & reverberation effects applied to a couple of ambient microphones only, in order to obtain (in real time during the improvised performance) a vortex of sound where all instruments, vocals and any debris of acoustic echoes & reflections are centrifuged/blend together—to create the “space bubble” effect indeed.\nIn addition, imagining themselves performing in this “antigravitational bubble” as astronauts at zero gravity, MCIAA decided not to use their own instrumentation, instead choosing at random from the wide range of instruments adorning the room, from ancient ones made of wood and metal to ethnic weirdnesses.\nPersonnel: Maurizio Opalio (three tone chime hand bell, metal coins, vibratone, bell tree, small ethnic string instruments, steel drum); Roberto Opalio (wordless vocals, 1960s Philicorda valve organ, old pendulum clock mechanism, wind chimes, ektara gopichand); Joëlle Vinciarelli (wordless vocals, flugelhorn, hurgy toy, ethnic whistles, ancient flute); Eric Lombaert (drums, cowbells, bamboo and steel percussion).\nOn LP2 > ETERNAL BEYOND > IV celebrates 10 years of uncompromising music challenges. Started in 2015, the partnership between the two space-brothers Maurizio and Roberto Opalio and the “French queen of grunt” Joëlle Vinciarelli (La Morte Young, The Strange Strings Ensemble) has been growing stronger and stronger, following uniquely its own language. The trio deliberately imposes upon itself a self-exile over the edge of the sub-underground, disgusted by the so-called “avant-music” scene which is nowadays corrupted by mere mystification and sneaky business. > ETERNAL BEYOND > fights in the name of authenticity, as a conspirative, prophetic unit escaping all radars of our GPS-controlled society.\n> ETERNAL BEYOND > tracks’ titles often paid tribute to legendary artists, poets, musicians and outsiders such as Albert Ayler, William Blake, Dylan Thomas, Art Ensemble Of Chicago and Arthur Rimbaud… Here the side-long track title “> Eternal Ecstasy of the Pain >” homages both Georges Bataille's philosophical writings and the texts of Mahāmudrā, the “great seal” of Tibetan Buddhism. The trio creates this epic masterpiece with only the use of Maurizio Opalio’s antique upright piano soundboard, Roberto Opalio’s wordless vocals and trademark alientronics, and Joëlle Vinciarelli’s unorthodox trumpet which awakens the spirits of the most creative free-jazz figures of all time.\nAs Anthony D’Amico wrote in Brainwashed, “With > ETERNAL BEYOND > the Opalios and Vinciarelli evoke something significantly different that I cannot find anywhere else: the singular collision of the imagined past versus the imagined future, the spectral versus the corporeal, and flesh-and-blood humanity versus the unknowable, abstract vastness of the cosmos”.\nThis double album is undeniably a 100% “alien” distillate of ancient ritual music, avant-garde, experimental, noise, free jazz, raga, minimalism and ethnic sacred chants. This is total music! The Opalio brothers together with Vinciarelli and Lombaert seat you by the river of space-time to experience the whole history of creative music from the dawn of time to what is yet to come.",

All rights reserved.\nⓅ & Ⓒ 2018 Opax Records / Elliptical Noise\nmycatisanalien.com\nElliptical Noise Records ΑΩ6577CD\nDESCRIPTION:\n‘The Sky With Broken Arms’ is the brand new studio album by MY CAT IS AN ALIEN which officially opens the duo’s 20th ANNIVERSARY in 2018–a year rich of exciting projects, collaborations and releases. Brothers MAURIZIO and ROBERTO OPALIO have been active as radical instantaneous composers since the beginning in early 1998, their work always characterized by the willingness to challenge oneself and throw oneself forward towards the unknown realms of art, intended as the highest projection and expression of the self. This ongoing, imperative challenge brought MCIAA’s musical research towards constant innovation, making each of their 200+ musical releases a step onward, and their entire opus simply unique. “[..] there are few other artists who have been so unwaveringly challenging and iconoclastic for as long as the Opalios\" (Anthony D’Amico, BRAINWASHED). The deep authenticity of their sound has always shined throughout the large number of collaborations set up during the years with vanguards such as SONIC YOUTH, JIM O'ROURKE, KEIJI HAINO, CHRISTIAN MARCLAY, MATS GUSTAFSSON, JEAN-MARC MONTERA, NELS CLINE, LOREN CONNORS, among many others. MCIAA’s rare live performances mirror the brothers’ vision of the creative act as the most powerful shamanic ritual, bringing together their performative action with the diverse aspects of their intermedia activities like the “cinematic poetry” films by Roberto Opalio. Their idiosyncratic improvising skill and extraordinary psychic connection have been under the radar of thousands of visitors during the opening days of the 57th VENICE ART BIENNALE in May 2017, when MCIAA activated the Studio Venezia project at the French Pavilion invited by artist XAVIER VEILHAN and curator CHRISTIAN MARCLAY.\nThe new album ‘The Sky With Broken Arms’ is therefore a further step ahead into the realm of the unknown, where the music made of minimal, dreamy guitar chords and eerie wordless vocals over a dense layer of crackling noise comes out of a strong conceptual idea.\nAs Roberto Opalio’s foreword to the work reads “A winter day two years ago I found out that an entire section of my vinyl records collection was completely ruined by an inexplicable oxidation process. [..] As a first reaction, I decided not to play those records ever again... and that I did, for a long time. ‘Til one night, exhausted, I felt the absolute urgency to listen to one of those LPs whose musical content got buried by the vinyl surface noise. In that moment the shocking epiphany: [..] slowly, I began to perceive that not only the old, beloved sounds I was used to were all still there, but also that the layer of ground noise obliged me to an even more attentive and active listening; thus I was discovering very subtle sound details now claiming their own being and pretending their own space. The idea of a new MCIAA album came out of this enlightenment. A new concept concerning the representation of music on the one hand and its perception on the other. A music so essential and precious as to be discovered by the listener little by little, because hidden by a blanket of crackling noise, which I obtained from the blank grooves of my damaged vinyls. Thus, here we are: infinite spaces of disintegration and psycho-existential ecstasy… essentially, spaces of non-limited, non-stoppable Poetry”.\nThe not-compressed, not-balanced mastering devised by MCIAA provides a natural, immersive listening experience. CD comes in full-color gatefold digisleeve. Cover art features an intense photography shot on 35mm slide film by Roberto Opalio. Artwork design by MCIAA.",

            "about": "*** Honorable mention as final step in the book \"MUSIQUES, TRAVERSES & HORIZONS: a century of music\" (Le Mot et le reste) by critic & writer PHILIPPE ROBERT:\n\"The history of the most influencial music of the past 100 years. All begins with the historic contents of Harry Smith Anthology of American Folk Music and all ends with My Cat Is An Alien \"The World that IS and IS NOT\"\n[..] Here all pertains to a gesture as part of a wider history: their own history, the whole history of music too, and even more. Since through My Cat Is An Alien we dare the eternal without being guilty of sacrilege. An Eternal which they reach exploring pathways that range from Duration to Time, from Repetition to Becoming, and from Silence to Being [..]\n[..] For the Opalio brothers the creative act is as serious as their own lives. Needless to say, this is an implicitly political act of resistance. Immersive, their own Merzbau has no limits. Space is the place.\"\n_________________________\n'The World that IS and IS NOT' is the enigmatic title of My Cat Is An Alien's new \"concept album\". 'The World that IS and IS NOT' is the existential reflection of MCIAA on 2020: a pandemic scenario where everything seems to vanish into the Void.\nExplicitly dedicating this new studio album to the dark ages we’re all living through, more than ever MCIAA stand strong to claim that Music and Art are the primary and true “cure” for spiritual disquiet and moral despair.\nThus the music herein is highly spiritual, sensitive, soft and warm… surprisingly lyrical. Its celestial melodies cannot but induce to transcendental meditations. MCIAA offer a one-way ticket to still unexplored otherwordly territories and better realms of space-time consciousness.\nAn inborn wisdom that Roberto Opalio resumes in his poem handwritten on the album insert: \"In the endless vortex of No-Thing / […] I still do believe / Art can save my Spiritual Noise soul\".\nProduced by MCIAA in multi-dimensional, fully dynamics-frequency spectrum “STEREOALIEN FIDELITY”.\nReleased on the renewed Opax Private Press imprint in a first, ultra-limited and hand-numbered edition of 100 Silver Color Vinyl LPs, housed in full-color printed jacket with folded cover/insert on Italian fine art linen textured 250g cardboard. Includes a 70x50 cm Poster. Cover and poster painting by Roberto Opalio. Design by MCIAA.",

            "about": "LP album originally released by Starlight Furniture Co. / Revolver USA\n\"Joining Maurizio and Roberto Opalio on their fourth album for Starlight Furniture Co., legendary French-Corsican guitarist and co-founder of Groupe de Recherche et d’Improvisation Musicales brings his noisy lyricism to three long tracks of oddly sensual and animalistic space howl. As their past collaborations attest, My Cat Is An Alien’s self-sustaining biosphere is an environment where the surreal dreamscapes of mavericks and eccentrics flourish. On this live recording, Jean-Marc Montera’s home-made guitar table, objects, and electronics forge metallic ribbons that twitch between the distant clangs of gigantic spores, while Maurizio (on home-made double-bodied string instrument and effects) and Roberto (on alientronics, effects, and modified electronic devices) set worms adrift in a zero-gravity aviary stocked with narcotized satsuma fowl. Roberto adds disorientation to the trio’s fog-blurred horizon with wordless vocalizations that could pass for billowing laments hooted by mutant sea mammals with enoki mushrooms growing on their larynxes.\"\n“Since the late 1990s My Cat Is An Alien have successfully renewed a commitment to psychedelia as a revealing factor of the soul,\" says French critic and writer Philippe Robert. \"Brothers Roberto and Maurizio Opalio’s interest in John Cage’s thought and in free improvisation is hardly a secret; hence the attraction toward architectures based on the concept of instantaneous composition, created from extended practices. In March 2015, serendipity brought together My Cat Is An Alien and guitarist Jean-Marc Montera in Marseille, for a concert where complicity manifested itself immediately, thanks to simpatico affinities (Montera in France is a pioneer of non-idiomatic improvisation) and encounters (among which we will just mention Thurston Moore and Lee Ranaldo). The trio set out for the beyond, in search of the Harmony of the Spheres, as they have, again and again\". - PHILIPPE ROBERT, author of \"Musiques Expèrimentales\"",
