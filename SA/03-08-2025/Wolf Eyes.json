            "about": "What happens when Detroit's Wolf Eyes and Austin's Blank Hellscape team up to provide a suitably nightmarish backdrop for USA 2020 vanquished by fear, greed, incurable disease, etc. ? Fuck if I know, it's not like they recorded their tracks in the same room while watching cable news. I mean, credit both ensembles for having an imaginative bone in their bodies or two. On the left, we have Michigan's synapse-snapping heavyweight champs. On the right, 3 fellas whose 2019 Diseased Tapes debut was one of the year's most harrowing listening experiences. This EP required no fewer than 3 mastering engineers, 2 personal trainers and 1 and a half psychologists (there was a credentials question) to complete.",

            "about": "WOLF EYES presents \"Droll Box,\" a 3CD box set accompanied by a booklet. This expansive collection resurrects a decaying wave of the Droll series on American Tapes, meticulously restored from the original cassettes recorded between winter and fall 2001. Experience the raw audio skeletons of Wolf Eyes' early basement maneuvers, showcasing their classic and intricately woven styles.\nThe set features a full-color box and a 16-page booklet, both vividly bringing to life the essence of the era. The audio, preserved in digital clarity, reflects the untamed spirit of Wolf Eyes' formative years, characterized by dank electronics and scotch tape experimentation that defies conventional musical norms. These recordings, crafted over two decades ago in Ann Arbor, Michigan, bear the indelible marks of Nate Young, Aaron Dilloway, and Johnny Olson.\nWith archival assistance and transfers by Henry Bent and Knox Mitchell, this UK import is a limited edition of 300 copies. Immerse yourself in the shadows of musical rebellion that has to this day, remained forever forward and backwards.",

            "about": "Ann Arbor, MI’s Wolf Eyes are at the forefront of a quickly expanding American noise scene. The trio of Nate Young, Aaron Dilloway and John Olson are the epitome of the self-sufficient musical entity. Olson and Dilloway have their own labels (American Tapes and Hanson Records respectively) that have been releasing cassettes, CDRs, 7\"s, LPs and just about every other format, often in painfully limited editions, of Wolf Eyes material since Young first used the moniker in 1997. Their existence as a trio dates to 2000. And they’ve since released albums on Bulb (Dread, 2001) and Troubleman Unlimited (Dead Hills, 2002). The music that Wolf Eyes creates is truly terrifying; the soundtrack to street fight that erupts into outright incineration. Sonic touchstones include Throbbing Gristle, early Cabaret Voltaire, Black Flag, Whitehouse, Pre-Asheton Destroy All Monsters, Negative Approach, Swans and early Sonic Youth. The advocacy of the latter has led to many opening slots and a spot on the entire 2004 Lollapalooza tour.",

            "about": "A selection of private press 45s featuring Nate Young, John Olson, Alex Moskos, Gretchen Gonzales, Aaron Dilloway & Raven Chacon. These collaborations between the core Wolf Eyes crew and friends was originally self-released as a series of super-limited 7” hand painted box sets, but now the core ‘hits’ have been compiled by Disciples for wider consumption.\nWolf Eyes' history with collaboration goes back almost 26 years. From the first Wolf Eyes w/Spykes concert that led to Olson joining the band to Smegma, Braxton, Richard Pinhas, Merzbow, Marshall Allen, and many more. Wolf Eyes has continued expanding musical ideas through collaboration and Difficult Messages is the first compilation of this practice.\nMany of the bands on 'Difficult Messages' exist inside an assemblage of a mail art tradition. Most of the music was made remotely and this allowed for deeper exploration into styles that might have been too uncomfortable to attempt face to face. Short Hands finds Nate Young, and Alex Moskos exchanging bass and guitar fragments with Olson’s reeds and tones overtop sculpted into odd rock songs. Wolf Raven touches on harsh electronics and pushes forward into postmodern ideas of composition. Time Designers is a duo of Alex Moskos and Nate Young using hacked drum machines and a 'design' approach to organizing sound. U Eye finds Olson and Young alongside longtime collaborators Gretchen Gonzales and Aaron Dilloway for a scrape and tape session recorded by Warren Defever. Stare Case is Olson and Young in a non-Wolf duo. Perhaps the only 'rules following' project these two have EVER had. The collection of audio tracks could be looked at as an exquisite corpse: a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. With this method over thirty tracks and four hundred paintings were created.",

            "about": "“Necessary reissue of this crucial side by the greatest underground band of your lifetime. Still sounds like nothing else.” – David Keenan (This Is Memorial Device / Volcanic Tongue)\nA sought after early Wolf Eyes album back on vinyl and CD for the first time in 17 years. Originally released on Hanson Records, American Tapes and Bulb Records in 2001. Filters circuit bent electronics, fried dub and the dystopian proto-punk of Cabaret Voltaire and Suicide through a distinctly Midwest USA sensibility. The result is a freak classic for the ages.\nThe vinyl edition comes with a double-sided fold-out A2 newsprint poster. Bonus track “Sandpapered Eyes” included on Vinyl DL card and as ‘hidden’ track on CD.\nThis release continues to establish LOWER FLOOR MUSIC as a new home for the group’s cultural vision, highlighting both new and archival work. Last year the label was minted with the release of their harrowing Undertow LP and the slowed down techno-meets-freefrom jazz devastation of the follow-up Strange Days II 12’. This is the latest fork in a path the band started forging in 1998, releasing a massive amount of small run DIY basement recorded tape and CD-R missives, as well as higher profile albums for the likes of Sub Pop, Third Man and De Stijl.\nOriginally released 2001",

            "about": "Dreams In Splattered Lines fuses together Wolf Eyes' 25 years of DIY electronics with the avant-garde sensibilities of Fluxus and the granite of dreary Midwestern life. Continuing some of the ideas explored on the Difficult Messages record of collaborations, the result is a surreal dreamscape of disorienting sound collages, where hit songs are transformed into terrariums of sonic flora and decimated fauna. As if pulled from a fever dream, the surrealists of the 1960s converge with alien electronic blues musicians in an underworld of mystery. The air is thick with car wash radio white noise, crackling and fizzing like a toxic elixir, spoken word poetry transmissions as absurd and cryptic phrases. Each corroded aural environment is a microcosm of chaos, honed to razor-sharp precision. Swept away in a whirlwind of thirteen perplexing narratives, each one an unpredictable journey through subterranean worlds, a sonic trip of reality folded into itself.",

            "about": "UNIVERSAL EYES is the culmination of UNIVERSAL INDIANS and WOLF EYES. UNIVERSAL INDIANS started in Lansing Michigan in the early shadows of the 90’s, with Gretchen Gonzales (now Gonzales Davidson), Bryan Ramirez, & Johnny “Inzane” Olson. The trio started as a Jesse Harper cover band and managed to play every single basement that had a power outlet in the tri-county area. After moving to the Detroit area in the late 90’s, Rammer was replaced by Aaron Dilloway, who along with Nathan Young were already in the throes of primitive electronic global domination that is WOLF EYES. The collective quartet played every art space, record store, and club in the Detroit area and together coined the Michigan Progressive Underground audio sprawl. Around the dawn of the 2000’s, Gretchen went full time with the moody & cold stylings of SLUMBER PARTY and after a wild Bowling Green Ohio gig, Olson joined WOLF EYES full time. After some drama that would make even Fleetwood Mac disappear into the shadows of suburbia and toss their EQ into a lonely fire, UNIVERSAL INDIANS appeared to have fate / faded into the packed history book pages of Michigan musical lore.\nAs age and time seem to dust over wounds while magically healing them, the quartet met again in the northern suburbs of Detroit on a brisk spring Sunday in 2018. They hauled modern and ancient instruments into a home studio and just like that: the dream / nightmare had hot blood pumping thru its’ duct-taped sound body once again, as if the missing years were nothing but a minute hurdle. The kings and queen of noise were reunited.\n“Four Variations On 'Artificial Society'\" is the nearly exact document of this unholy reunion captured in full detail by Warren Defever (HIS NAME IS ALIVE). The two record set will be on coke bottle clear and white vinyl presented by Trip Metal Limited label in partnership with Lower Floor, with record speeds to be determined by the listener. UNIVERSAL EYES has been born/reborn in proof that free spirits can always move forward and still be intoxicated by the horrid liquid that is ROCK & FRY. JOIN US.",

            "about": "After a year of non-stop touring in support of 2004’s Burned Mind, Wolf Eyes were ready; seasoned to travel through horrible new areas of sound. During one four-week period at the dawn of ‘06, they laid down the ideas that would shape the new album in their studio, the Terror Tank. This new slab is the first with Mike Connelly (of Hair Police and the Gods of Tundra label) replacing Aaron Dilloway. Though he no longer tours with the band, Dilloway remains involved and helped to mix the new record with BMG (who also did the deed on Burned Mind).These songs are rotten with metal, reeds, consciousness-erasing islands of black doom; bass-heavy rippers, late-night free-terror jams, afflicted dog-hearts, underwater crabs: pure mayhem. The new double bass attack is showcased on “Human Animal” and “Rusted Mange” with scraping strings and a full terror-shriek workout re-organized by Dilloway. New directions are countered by “Rationed Rot,” which revisits the eerie Throbbing Gristle-esque vocal deployment that dates from Wolf Eyes’ Dread LP. The album also features the band’s first ever cover song: a dead-on rendering of No Fucker’s rotten hXc anthem, “Noise Not Music,” which closed out a lot of shows on Wolf Eyes’ recent European tour. As ever, Wolf Eyes will be living on the road, with Australian and American tours in the works, and more on the horizon.",

            "about": "A soundclash of double dissentient duos, opening up an eternal k-hole tunnel linking the Michigan underground with the subterranean saturnalians from Washington DC.\nMusic that sounds like melting pavements and heat hazed shimmer, a million conversations overheard but only the occasional outline of a word sinks in, repetitive ad-stream mantras “ALWAYS BE BRANDING”, footing lost during stagger up information junk pile, atoms disengage and re-arrange, something like the memory of a shape.\nWolf Eyes and Model Home met in November 2022 when they played a show together at the Market Hotel in Brooklyn. Already aware of each other’s music, and sharing a connection via the Disciples label, there was an immediate recognition of kindred spirits, plans hatched for future collaboration. January 2023 saw the release of Wolf Eyes Presents Difficult Messages, a compilation LP of private press 45s originally released as a series of homemade mail order boxsets during the pandemic, featuring the core Wolf crew of Nate Young and John Olson trading long distance sounds with friends such as Raven Chacon, Alex Moskos (AIDS Wolf, Drainolith), Aaron Dilloway, and Gretchen Gonzales (Universal Indians, Infinite River). Whilst the compilation (beautifully presented as a limited clear vinyl LP + zine package) collated a highlights reel from the project, there were plenty of tracks not included for reasons of space. These recordings were handed over to Model Home to mess with further, in the same way that they had taken the His Name Is Alive ‘beat tape’ Return Versions and dubbed it into infinity. On More Difficult Messages they fracture the already disintegrating tracks into separate shards and reconstruct them into new shapes, adding hand-built synth bleeps, irregular drum machine patterns and the abstracted mic flow of NAPPYNAPPA, deftly stitched together by Pat Cain at the controls, with added floor tom by Future Times head honcho Dolo Percussion on one track. The tape is presented JA style, with vocals on one side and instrumental excursions on the flip, this is a true meeting of mangled minds.",

Plenty of room inside the sonic din collision of reeds, frozen rhythms and general hard staring into the shadowy corners of the deep audio cosmos to find your own personal universe. More questions than answers. WOLF EYES FOREVER.\nAfter the UNDERTOW washes you up on the shores of an unmarked empty island, you find yourself stuck dead center tangled inside a world where the air is filled with buzzing electronics beamed in from a arcane planet and the \"things\" that are living are hungry for marrow of anything that was considered \"music\" from the year 2391 AD. You are left alone with how to recreate sound from scratch, using nothing but the wind and mystery. Only words left from the human race are carved slowly on the trunk of a twisted tree, carefully saying \"WOLF EYES WERE HERE AND THESE WERE TRULY STRANGE DAYS.\"",

            "about": "\"Lower Floor presents TWO CIVILIZED CENTERS, a split release from Universal Eyes and Wolf Eyes. This is a seriously devastating entity of slow-motion techno, noise and beamed in live and direct from the deepest corners of the Michigan underground.\nWolf Eyes' 16 minutes plus 'C.Centers One' hunts under the wreckage of the rolling tekno gloom of the Strange Days II 12\", yet with the expansive running /crawling time of the duration of the track offers an extended coating of noise abstraction and stretched out otherworldly electronics. Universal Eyes' 'Civilized Two' and 'Civilized Three' strips everything backwards with two bleak, winter-coated drones. Perfect for cold months spent in the dead hills.\" - Bleep",

            "about": "Times of chaos ring the bells for the newest sea-bottom R&B sound lurch from radical sonic artists WOLF EYES. The U$A’s longest-running homemade primitive electronic poetry & vibes trio launch another scotched taped nuclear audio front on humanity. The 2017 release Undertow finds the trio diving into new depths of the electronic and free jazz infected world. A world they created themselves from scratch, running over the course of two decades.\nThe vinyl edition comes with a double-sided foldout A2 poster featuring album artwork on one side and a compilation of gig flyers and imagery documenting twenty years of noise and troubled chaos on the reverse. A full download card is also included.\nFormed in 1996 in Detroit, Michigan, WOLF EYES have recorded for Sub Pop, Troubleman Unlimited, De Stijl and most recently Jack White’s Third Man label, as well as their countless self-released documents of audio destruction and micro-run slabs of noise. The band has an inzane history of collaborations, side projects and solo outputs. While staying consistently road-hardened they’ve shared stages with everyone from Sonic Youth to Anthony Braxton to Andrew W.K. to Aphex Twin to Morton Subotnick. The Wolf boys also continue to play gigs with all like-minded outsider stoner/loner freaks in the world’s basements, from whence this beast originally emerged.\nLOWER FLOOR MUSIC is a brand new imprint dedicated to the group’s cultural vision. The Lower Floor Music label will be curated by Wolf Eyes and feature both new and archival visions from the band as well as work by like-minded artists. Lower Floor Music will benefit from a world-wild distribution deal providing fans of electronic music across the globe access to Wolf Eyes’ sound-vision and like-minded community spirits. The idea of a home-basement for Wolf Eyes is not new. Since 1998 the band has generated a massive tidal wave of releases nearly adding up to over 500 titles; mostly limited from 2-100 copies. Released on American Tapes, Hanson, AA, Warzone, and countless other independent/homemade labels, these documents often vanished forever into the arcane crypts of collectors. WOLF EYES has the unending thirst to explore every shadowy sonic corner of the homespun audio universe.\n\"UNDERTOW\" and \"LOWER FLOOR MUSIC\": direct expression from the rotten rat explorers to sink into the seams of your soul.",

            "about": "First release in a new multi-part series of solo releases by the Wolf Eyes frontman. An evolution from the previous Regression material, taking in elements of classic synth soundtracks, ambient and electronic body music, but filtered through a typically off-centre Michigan underground sensibility.\nIn the Regression series–Regression (2009), Stay Asleep (2011), Other Days (2012), Blinding Confusion (2013)–Young drew a compositional aesthetic from Italian library music and musique concrète. Since then, Young has been interpreting the traditional musical methods of rhythm and melody into complex synthesizer compositions. These songs were commonly made as a distraction from grief, seasonal depression, and isolation. Sometimes severely ridiculous and unrelenting; other times slow, sparse and strange; this material didn’t fit in with the Regression series. It was archived and unreleased until now. Nate Young Volume One: Dilemmas Of Identity will be released February, 2019 on Lower Floor Music.",

            "about": "\"On Dilemmas Of Identity and Nightshade, Wolf Eyes’ Nate Young found himself forging a sound that balanced a sort of disorientated take on electronic punk with the kind of melodic loops one found in the output of Feels-era Animal Collective. However, on the latest of Young’s solo EPs we see him ditching the psychedelic treatments of Panda, Avey et al.\nOn Volume Three: Dance Of The Weeping Babe, Young strips out pretty much everything bar the rhythm and the noise. This is a collection of slow, unsettling beat tracks, the roots of which lie in minimal wave, industrial music and the ‘freakbeat’ sound currently being pioneered by Black Dice’s Eric Copeland. The loping tempo of Dance Of The Weeping Babe, and the fact that the numbers here do not vary much, means that Dance Of The Weeping Babe sounds like it’s been conceived to soundtrack someone wading through a tar pit.\nYoung chooses to augment his drums sparingly. While always liberally doused with delay - a technique that evokes a latent dub influence - these tracks only bring one or two elements into play alongside the rhythms. ‘Human Pond’, for instance, features a half-sung vocal that could have been culled from the last Girl Band LP, while ‘People Lose’ focuses on an unsettling single-note piano loop. All of the space on this record makes it at once unsettling and intriguing in a manner that recalls Suicide or Cabaret Voltaire.\nThe third release in Nate Young’s ongoing 2019 solo series finds the Wolf Eyes mainstay going even further down the rabbit hole.\" - Bleep",

            "about": "\"Wolf Eyes’ Nate Young fudges around on his new set-up in ‘Volume Two: Nightshade’, the 2nd in a series of new solo releases on Lower Floor\nIn eight (mostly) succinct parts he indulges a primitivist approach to his modular synths and FX, resulting misshaped creation that sound a bit like ambient, industrial, and synth soundtracks, but not quite.\nWith classic Wolf Eyes style, they all sound off-the-cuff, coughed up in one go while possibly blindfolded. The result variously sound like a blind man trying to break his way out of a huge water tank with a spanner one minute, then like a kid who found an old keyboard and sequencer luckily plugged into an amp, or Container working off dying batteries.\" - Boomkat",

            "about": "Wolf Eyes w/ Spykes was recorded on Marshall St in Ann Arbor, Michigan on October 2nd, 2000. The group recorded this material live directly to 2-track reel to reel, giving it a raw and unrefined quality. The album credits Aaron Dilloway: electronics, tapes, and mix, John Olson: electronics and keys, and Nate Young: voice, keys, and secrets. Originally released in limited edition by Hanson Records for tour, this re-release is a glimpse into the foundation of what Wolf Eyes would become and remains a defining moment of the group's discography. Previously a two piece of Young and Dilloway, the result of this recording helped them decide to pull in Olson as a full time member and the first trio version of the band was formed. These are the strange creeping formulas that inspired Wolf Eyes to create over 300 releases and continue to push listeners towards the furthest edges of a raw homemade audio universe.\nWolf Eyes is currently performing and releasing music as a duo consisting of John Olson and Nate Young. They have garnered a reputation as one of the most frightening and weird bands in the world. Their music is not for the faint of heart and is sure to leave a lasting impression on anyone who dares to listen. Aaron Dilloway is currently recording and performing in Kathmandu, Nepal.\nMastered for vinyl by Jack Callahan, this monumental recording is pressed in an edition of 1000 copies",
