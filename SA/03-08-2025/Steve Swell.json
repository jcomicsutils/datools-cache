            "about": "Its May 2020 and I’m sheltered in place, alone in Manhattan, washing my hands, food shopping every two to four days. No gigs. Plenty of time for listening. Which is what I was doing, going through some old recordings never released or forgotten when all this Covid stuff began. That is how I discovered this session from 2007 that drummer Ray Sage had put together. As I began to listen to these tracks I gave a lot of thought to the music and uncompromising determination of Borah and Perry both of whom I had known for a number of years. It’s always amazing to me how when I listen to a musician who has passed, especially one I’ve known and worked with, how they shine more brightly now from this distance as opposed to when we played together. It is a different kind of listening. A different feeling. I guess it’s a matter of listening to them from the outside of myself now instead of remembering what it was like playing with them, from the inside. When I was playing with them and interacting to form these improvisations my focus was on the ebb and flow of those interactions. At that moment we are treasure hunters, searching for that priceless nugget. Listening back now, from this distance and isolation, everything we played seems to shine brighter and clearer now. Away from the searching, becoming a presence that is very much alive and a confirmation that this kind of work is truly special.\nBorah and Perry both have special places in the pantheon of improvised music and I was ever so fortunate to get to play with them. They brought a devotion, commitment and originality to their approaches to improvisation and the techniques they used on their chosen instruments. I first heard Borah in a live concert when I was 19 years old. He was known for his interest in using his left hand as an equal to his right. Something he could talk about extensively and that he demonstrates on his many recordings and concerts. Perry was a magician and a musical magician, always happy to play. An independent voice traveling through life wherever it took him physically and musically. His personal history is a unique one with having a successful songwriting father who was a part of Woody Guthrie’s inner circle whom Perry knew as a child.\nNow that both are gone, I am happy to have this document see the light of day that Ray was responsible for putting together. I hope it pleases and enriches you as much as it does me in this very strange time and in a free, bright future time.\nMany thanks to Borah, Perry and Ray for their uncompromising focus and originality. To Chad Fowler for releasing this to a wider audience and to Jim Clouse for his valuable expertise.\nSteve Swell\nMay 11, 2020",

            "about": "Steve Swell\nI’ve been a huge fan of trombonist Steve Swell ever since first hearing him live in Cologne, in my native Germany, in the early 1990s as a member of\nJoey Baron’s band.\nBy the late 2000s, I had relocated to New York City. While I already knew a lot of musicians from earlier visits, it took time to make new friends and be seen as a local – I had to prove that I was not just a visitor. I will forever be grateful to Karl Berger, another “Kraut in the Big Apple” and an old friend, who invited me to join his newly formed Improvisers Orchestra early on.\nRight off the bat, the group had a residency at John Zorn’s club, “The Stone,” on Avenue C in Manhattan, where we started rehearsing and performing every Monday for a year before moving on to other venues. That’s where I first met and played with Steve, and we’ve never looked back, until the beginning of the pandemic when everybody in the city just hunkered down.\nThis spring we reconnected as members of a large ensemble under the direction of bassist and composer Pascal Niggenkemper. Following that event, Steve and I decided to play duo again, something we had not done in years. After a Swell/Heberer concert at Downtown Music Gallery in the Chinatown in July, we agreed to do this recording later in the summer.\nWe sincerely hope you’ll enjoy the results, 12 improvised pieces, a back and forth between tracks that focus on extended techniques and those\nthat emphasize pitch-related materials.\nThomas Heberer, New York City, October 16, 2023\nThomas Heberer\nThomas Heberer is a longstanding member of the Instant Composers Pool (ICP). He’s a solid interpreter of some very complicated compositions from a group that is well known for its fast paced stopping and starting of different genres, rapid tempo changes, different textures and of course their very Dutch sense of humor. And all of those elements are utilized during just one piece and those elements get included in just about every other piece they perform during the course of one of their sets. And they’re all pretty well known as a wild bunch, in a good way of course. Thomas is such a great person besides being a great musician, I’ve come to believe he’s been a real grounding force for that group.\nWhen Thomas started living in New York I really didn’t know him that well. I think we might have met once or twice but I couldn’t tell you where or when. When Karl Berger started his residency at the Stone to raise money for his Creative Music Studio I signed on and found Thomas there as well. I immediately took to this fellow brass man, sitting together, making up backgrounds and trading solos each of those evenings. There were some nights that Thomas soloed so beautifully it reminded me of how you can be inspired not just by your heroes but by those musicians you share the bandstand with on any given night.\nWe had made several attempts to play duo, mostly with compositions but our busy schedules really didn’t allow for us to build a strong vocabulary. Then this past summer we decided to get together on a regular basis to play and record at Thomas’s Upper West Side apartment. We decided at that time that the best approach would be to improvise rather than play compositions. I think that it was the right approach. And we recorded everything we did. Thomas had the dual job of playing and recording and then mixing everything for this Bandcamp release. And, he came up with the idea for naming the pieces after different paradoxes which he had researched. I have to give him a lot of credit for keeping it/me going and making this happen. It was fun playing and just hanging and talking with him after being so separate from all of our musician friends for so long during Covid. The music here shows the many facets of improvising for trumpet and trombone. We hope it is a worthy representation of our efforts.\nSteve Swell, October 19, 2023, 32,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean",

            "about": "To mark bassist William Parker's 65th birthday, Philly-based reedman Bobby Zankel convened an all star sextet which included the honoree for a presentation of free jazz collectivism at the city's Painted Bride Arts Center in January 2017. Although not regular collaborators, they go back a long way. The pair first hooked up back in the loft jazz era when both gravitated towards Cecil Taylor's orbit, to perform in the pianist's legendary Carnegie Hall large ensemble concert. Taylor, and particularly his then ever present saxophonist Jimmy Lyons, have remained touchstones for Zankel over the years.\nIn his aching cry, which harks back to Charlie Parker by way of Ornette Coleman, the reedman recalls Lyons, and not only through his bittersweet tone but also in the way he builds his unfurling statements through repeated cellular motifs. Those motifs, drawn from the book for his Warriors Of The Wonderful Sound big band, act as launch pads for the accomplished improvisers assembled on this occasion. Violinist Diane Monroe, who briefly filled Billy Bang's shoes in the String Trio of New York, demonstrates her familiarity with the altoist's methods by first shadowing then extrapolating from Zankel's lead, serving to fill out the polyphonic interplay.\nSuch fare is meat and drink to trombonist Steve Swell, and he responds by weaving his inventive voicings through the ensembles, while calling on the thematic material to render supporting riffs. Pianist Dave Burrell brings an oblique perspective, providing probing yet idiosyncratic support which adds another layer of interest to the exchanges of the front line. In tandem with the pulsations of drummer Muhammad Ali, Parker largely avoids the spotlight as he creates the ceaselessly tugging momentum that underpins both the group interaction and the resultant solo spots.\nAlthough most of the individual honors go to Zankel, he ensures that everyone gets an opportunity to shine during an uninterrupted 45-minute performance demarcated into four tracks. Burrell's contribution is especially noteworthy as he distils Monkish dissonance and prancing ragtime in a sparse mix, before culminating in sweeping glissandos which add back in all the notes he left out. Of course, Parker gets his turn too, in which he exhibits the adventurous arco sawing which helped make his name in the first place, before a rhythmic phrase ushers in the concluding theme, another of Zankel's yearning lines to complete a vital tribute.\nJohn Sharpe\nAll About Jazz, April 1, 2028",

            "about": "\"The jazz life imposes a stark choice on musicians. Knuckle under to commercial pressures and cease to be who you truly are, or be who you are and labor in obscurity. Steve Swell long ago made his choice. It's a hard choice but a liberating one and Swell has taken full advantage of the freedom with which he's chosen to make his art. \"I've got nothing to lose,\" he says, \"so I just do what I do.\"\nSwell does a lot with the limitless creative leeway he claims for himself. Take this album, for instance. He makes some surprising choices. As a free musician in every sense of the term, Swell, a composer of great power, wit, and skill, elects not to use composition at all on this album; it's completely improvised. A horn player who frequently collaborates with other horn plavers both as a leader and a sideman, he decided not to use a second wind instrument in this trio. The only thing remotely suggesting a game plan for the session was he knew he wanted keyboardist Robert Boston to play organ in addition to piano. Swell is not exactly a stranger to free improvisation, but when he elects to do it, he knows what's at stake and exactly why he wants to do it. \"I just wanted to go into this session unencumbered and see what we came up with,\" he says. \"To allow the magic to happen.\"\nNot surprisingly, given the caliber of the musicians involved, the magic does indeed happen. One reason the magic happens is that Swell knows how to put together bands in which everyone clicks: it's an aspect of his leadership that isn't cited enough. In choosing drummer Michael Vatcher and keyboardist Robert Boston, he's assembled a trio with quick reflexes, plenty of imagination, and total command of their instruments. Most importantly, there's never any wrestling over control of the music, the music is in charge and they let it take them where it will.\"\nEd Hazell from the liner notes",

Their moments of collective improvisation -- whether in rhythmic counterpoint or unison fly overs – would strain even the most practiced chops.

            "about": "Track 1 recorded live Cisco Bradley's house concert on August 15, 2015\nTracks 2-8 recorded by Jason Rostkowski at GSI Studios in Manhattan on December 13, 2022\nReleased on Relative Pitch (RPR1168) July 7, 2023\nAll tracks by Steve Swell Music (BMI)\nRhina P. Espaillat is a poet whose poem “Why Publish?” (please google it!) imagines how her poetry could touch someone 100 years from now. That poem speaks of her connection with a future reader. It inspired me to see my music the same way and think what it might mean for someone who picks up this recording in the future and connect with it in a way I might not have imagined. It might inspire a future listener to take the risk of creating or doing something not done before. Or be comforted somehow knowing there was someone feeling what they are feeling. My hope is for that kind of connection.\n\"Steve Swell remains one of Downtown’s most inventive and diverse trombonists, his career stretching back to the eighties, recording on a hundred plus records as playing live as often as is possible. Mr. Swell has recorded in dozens of different bands, as well as leading a number of his own projects. But solo trombone efforts are pretty rare, hence make this one even more special. His last and only other solo offering was from 2014.  Mr. Swell has worked long and hard on his playing, hence his sound is unique. The first, recorded live at author Cisco Bradley’s house series in 2015. Swell takes his time, playing those sizzling, lower-case radiator hissing-like sounds, as well as adding different trombone sounds here and there. Swell uses the resonance of the room to give his trombone a certain depth to his sound, as well as shifting his dynamics slowly throughout the piece. The studio recording is close mic’d and has a much different, clean, less hissy sound. Swell is experimenting here, tapping on the body of his trombone while he rubs or blows into the mouthpiece. Mr. Swell put a good deal of thought and preparation into the making of this disc. On each piece, he coaxes out different sounds, showing how many sounds one can get from a trombone. There a handful of solo trombone records by Paul Rutherford also Albert Mangelsdorff. We can add this one to the list of rare solo trombone gems\" - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG",

            "about": "The limited edition, vinyl-only release Dreamtime is like one of those conversations between two accomplished raconteurs that feels like a blessing to overhear. Recorded live April 2022 at St. Johann in Tyrol, Austria, this album brings together two musicians whose orbits have revolved around each other for many years, but only rarely coincided.\nReedman Mats Gustafsson, as one-third of the Scandinavian power trio The Thing and a fixture in the Peter Brötzmann Chicago Tentet, has earned a reputation as a ferocious flamethrower, but in his small group improvisational work he often reveals a more nuanced, timbrally-curious aspect in his playing. Here he furthers his explorations by wielding not only his customary baritone saxophone, but also flute, slide flute, fluteophone and slide sax, which dramatically alter his sonic\nfingerprint. Alongside him stands Steve Swell, one of the leading trombonists of the New York avant scene, and a partner of choice for musicians such as William Parker, the late Jemeel Moondoc and Jason Kao Hwang.\nThe exposed duet format allows both men to flex their muscles as well as demonstrate their sensitivity. They call on all manner of expressive techniques to create a litany of unconventional sounds: percussive plosives, breathy chunters, choked cries, fluttering murmurs and buzzing overtones. While Swell utilizes such strategies alongside the normal range of the trombone, the closest Gustafsson comes to convention is the visceral baritone sax blurts emitted during the ironically named “No More Melodies, Please”. He spends much of the 42-minute running time on his various flutes, and proves himself to be a fine exponent with a distinctive approach, notably so on the opening title track. The musicians’ interaction proceeds with a hair-trigger responsiveness—not working in direct relationship, but more obliquely in terms of matched density, volume and pace. They avoid either melodic or rhythmic agreement until the very end when, during the nicely judged “Song for Another time”, Gustafsson introduces a slow baritone bass-line over which Swell expounds a blues-inflected moan to round off an absorbing set.\nJohn Sharpe, NYCJR October 2023",

            "about": "There is nothing nothing surprising in this live recording of three great improvisers - German reed titan Peter Brötzmann, American trombonist Steve Swell and Norwegian powerhouse drummer Paal Nilssen-Love - that took place at the Alchemia club in Krakow, Poland on February, 2015, during the trio first ever tour. Still, it is a great one. All three are in top form throughout this demanding and intense 75-minutes performance.\nThis trio was formed out of the continuous work of Brötzmann and Nilssen-Love since the days of the Chicago Tentet, occasionally expanding the duo format with guest musicians as the innovative Japanese koto player Michiyo Yagi (Head On and Volda, both on Idiolect, 2008 and 2010) and the Moroccan gnawa guimbri player Maâllem Mokhtar Gania. Swell is an experienced leader who collaborated before with many innovative improvisers as Anthony Braxton and William Parker, to name just a few.\nSwell fits immediately to this high-octane format. He adds another strongly articulated voice as he contrasts the full-blast, intense interplay of and Nilssen-Love on the opening \"Oneiric Memories\". But this trio begins to deliver its great potential on the following, the completely different, 37-minutes “Full Spectrum Response” with its many shifting dynamics. After A short introduction by Nilssen-Love who explores his set cymbals, various gongs and drums skins resonating range, Brötzmann begins to explore his reeds timbral range, incorporating gentle and moving melodic themes, still, played in his typical tough manner. When Swell joins Brötzmann and Nilssen-Love, he expands the sonic envelope with his own sense of structure and melodic development. Now the trio sound as a balanced, organic unit of three opinionated individuals, enjoying this kind of immediate, constant changing dynamics and pulses. The trio develops the next piece, the slow-burning 13-minutes “Scotopia”, from three different angles, wisely and patiently the three voices are interwoven into a complex, nuanced texture. This excellent performance concludes with a return to to the full-blast vein of the opening pieces, with “Road Zipper”, highlighting the massive energy and the rich and powerful spectrum of this trio.\nKrakow Nights is Brötzmann’s best album in the last year and this trio is one of his best ones in recent years.\nEyal Hareuveni (Free Jazz Blog)",

Brötzmann, in top fiery form, outlines the urgent, angry theme, sets the trio dynamics on a volcanic course that gains more volume and more momentum... The other, shorter pieces highlight further the rich and profound vocabulary of this trio.\" -Eyal Hareuveni, Free Jazz Blog",

            "about": "\"If ever a group deserved the title of “free jazz power trio,” it would be this one. Legendary reedist Brötzmann, American trombonist Steve Swell, and the mighty Nilssen-Love have been playing together since early 2015, and have two masterful live sets under their belt, Krakow Nights and Live in Copenhagen. Both of those recordings boast a dense, muscular, yet occasionally free-wheeling sound that, in many ways, perfectly encapsulates just what these three players are all about - namely, raw power and fierce creativity. Live in Tel Aviv, which documents an October ‘16 performance by the trio, is the perfect entry-point for those who might be intimidated by the relatively long lengths of those prior albums - at only three-quarters of an hour, it is a thrilling condensation of the group’s strengths.\" -Derek Stone, Free Jazz Blog\n—",

Racing around to calm down Skyrocketing to happiness land in duct taped vehicles that have no center of gravity shaking out of control  veering into unconscious consciousness in a narcotic stupor that passes for living Oh what a condition This continuous perdition  This unrelenting schism This American edition Stagnant wages, rising debt  Propaganda that wildly demands your love of car, country, cash, credit, cookies, corn, cops, clover, criminals, clowns, creeps, comedy, cow pies and a clearly capitalist consumer collectivist consciousness that takes you  Deeper into the unsympathetic  Ass kicking brass knuckled grip of more Oh what a condition Our human condition The slime and stench of greed and the  Tangled reasoning that makes it good and holy Standing on truths that only Hollywood could convince you exists Without any sense of a shared experience or continuity of spirit Blunted hearts soaring with a million ways to take lunch  Or to get rich or famous  or ahead  or elected or  laid or dead The human condition Oh what a position This latest edition Evolving at the rate of snails While the tentacles of money and power and thoughtlessness Squeeze our souls to the tune of a higher tax rate As we squeal for more, screw our neighbor and end up with less than we deserve The bellowing, bewildered anxiety  of it all Just when the handle of certainty manages to wrap it’s warped little fingers around your mind The deeper self throws a knuckle ball your way to remind you to wake up but our blunted instincts swing wildly and miss Twisted dead dry hollowed out shells Supported and backed up by other twisted shells Perceiving faint shadows of the real  fighting to remember to break out  Ineptly attempted and too tired to try again Yet its there,  the poet, the painter the possible Popping up its head looking out over the woeful landscape  Crying amongst the underbrush of confusion and directionless Clearing a path to travel even if for a bit Singing bravely into the face of torpor and lethargy Switching on the lights in longing hearts and eyes Hearing the music, reading the books, igniting the soul So that we may know that there are options  and breath, and space, and time  and each other\t\t\t\t\t July 22, 2012",

                    "lyrics": "POETS OF THE NOW Hoarding shards of perceptionless vibrations, Smiling down tirelessly suffocating fears, Crossing rivers on the backs of formless jealousies, Climbing over the last dead, rotting insecurity. There and then, the Now appears Opening arms so as not to take them up, Lifting the front end of strollers up subway stairs, Listening to the silence of the void, before the first note touches the air, Gazing on the endless power and possibilities of the present. Witness this harvest of the Now from which such  sweet fruit is bared Glint of night retreating from newly sown seeds of breath, From behind glass walls, fragile self-esteem steps aside As soul reaches out, knocking it all away -- Free to connect to the world again, Sending isolation to its lonely grave. Yet staying vigilant, listening for the next crowding in of thoughts, Unwittingly ready to erect new enclosures. What’s it like to live in the past or future of your mind, I’ve mostly forgot, Confusing the Now with the fantasy of some other place and time, Some other experience, never resembling mine. Maybe seeing where I am right now is not where I’d hoped to be, But being able to BE that NOW in THIS time and space and KNOW The transitoriness of a situation and NOT let it determine who I am, But to know the wholeness of it all And not be swept away, lost, somehow, in the cluttered musings of some illusion. This is the lucidity of the immediate, The arrival of living. No more prisons of the mind, body or spirit, No more how-it-is-your-supposed-to-be police, Rambling, ramble Slowing, slow Center, centering Now, now The five skandas, both simultaneously present and destroyed, This is the challenge. The rich, the poor, The shuckster, the hustler, The businessman, the homeless, Those most proud of being gas guzzlers. All in need of this Now, Not simply a bunch of words, But something once found, The beauty of which paves a lush path to the infinite, Transforming the victims of the swamp into the  Poets of the Now.

That’s him!” and rejoice, telling everyone  until I saw him with my own two eyes He sang of such beautiful things fairness and liberty I wished and waited for his beautiful songs to materialize I wanted to tell everyone that it was true, it was him I’ve not only heard what you’ve been hearing but I saw him finally, and the things he sang of were real As I listened all week, I could see him in my minds eye Picturing him as his trilling crumbled hate and stupidity freeing the addict and housing the homeless Flying from tree to tree singing a just and tolerant world into existence Melting guns and tanks into food and housing  Yet I’ve heard him for so long without seeing him I realized that I  Must see him to be sure that those Beautiful things he was singing of would soon arrive  I wanted so very much to believe in what he was singing And today, I saw him On the top of a tree, alone, singing And just as I began to smile, he flew away Steve Swell 6/21/2020",

The other boys in his line stood motionless and never said \tanything either Then as quickly as it started it was over and we were moving again, in opposite directions,  the entire episode forgotten, by us But I will never forget that kid or his reaction and frustration  not being able to speak back to the taunts  as it was still too soon in our story as a country to push back on such slanders  I know now the only power he held was to deny his provocateurs any satisfaction in their \t\tcrude mockeries \t\t\t And in that moment a small but honorable victory was undeniably his 2014",

Traveling all this way to inhale God knows what?  We amble to the stage with its loose floor boards,  dust rising from the shabby curtains the smell of stale beer permeates the air  The band starts Our first notes signal that the rebellion has begun  Sometimes quietly, other times with a direct clarion call to  action  The oppressiveness of the space begins to notice  its presence is challenged It fights us with an arsenal of odd acoustics and  whirring cappuccino machines  but we persist  Soon  Foul odors begin to run from the poetry of trombone and  stumbles  becoming flowers  Darting flares of trumpet pierce the dark clouds above  painting yellow ribbons on the ceiling  Bass stands firm against the cynicism of this deliberate ruin,  our sanctuary of sound  Saxophone begins crushing the walls from every angle  screaming, crying  stinging the unsuspecting bitterness  Every howl and hymn beamed from our mob  speeds the reclamation of the space  Quickly  Doubt and jadedness are the first to exit  sunlight blinding them and melting their  sad whining into the pavement  Low expectations recoil and cower in each corner  Hatred loses its appeal and vanishes  like the mirage it always was  Our job is done, the arena is ours  transformed  2/17/2017",

            "about": "Fans of free jazz will delight in the band's energy, which seems inexhaustible, as well as the album's variety, with pieces ranging from heavy and Ornette Coleman-esque to lighthearted. Swell's opening solo on \"Not Their Kind\" gives the listener an apt introduction to his improvisational style. His trombone playing is intensely textural. Light years away from the scalar approaches of mainstream jazzers, and even quite removed from other well-known free players like Albert Mangelsdorff, whose use of multiphonics became so popular among trombonists. Swell spends the vast majority of his solos working \"across the grain\" of the trombone slide, using his athletic embouchure to flutter quickly, even spasmodically, between partials. This effervescent virtuosity can sound exhausting, but Swell rarely backs down. His tone has the characteristic buzz of a small-bore trombone, which compliments Sabir Mateen's saxophone playing. Like Swell, Mateen is adept at more vertically-oriented improvisation, able to deftly spring from the altissimo register to low, edgy growls. (Jacob Teichroew)\n***\n...the musicians always keep things interesting and things never fall into tedium. Mateen is the key to the success of the album, he shifts between a battery of instruments with a Sam Rivers like fluidity. (jazzandblues.blogspot)\n***\nThe loose, intrepid, liberating playing of Swell's Slammin' the Infinite is riveting and lively stuff, though, and this record exemplifies the spirit of musical freedom as well as any other I've heard recently. (Jordan Richardson)\n***\nThe album title alludes to a Walt Whitman essay suggesting that great art comes through perseverance, but, in fact, Swell's success rate is consistently high and with 5000 Poems the trombonist smashes another home run.

            "about": "Steve Swell is an adventurous, in-demand jazz trombonist that has been a stalwart of New York’s downtown free jazz scene for more than four decades. For this fresh album, he convened skilled workfellows who understand his creative trade inside out. This cross-generational sextet has the particularity of featuring the highly esteemed veteran drummer Andrew Cyrille and a newly discovered young harmonica player, the Israeli Ariel Bart, who demonstrates to have an instinctive musicality. Rounding out the group are Swell’s regular collaborators, violinist Jason Kao Hwang, keyboardist Robert Boston and cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm.\n“Celestial Navigation” opens the record as an energetic romp filled with piercing sounds and whimsical drumming. The imaginative routes and mysterious encounters suggested in the music come with a psychedelic touch spread by strings, chromatic harmonica and organ. For the period that Swell pours out an unorthodox statement, there’s a density of buzzing sounds filling the background.\nHaving its epic theme replicated between sections, “The Center Will Hold” carries a whirling pianism and loose pulsation in its finely wrought procedures. A warped trombone solo and respective piano comping form an exquisite combination of dissonance and countermelody, and then it’s Cyrille who, after joining Boston’s anarchic playing, responds with a discreet, rich and polished drum talk.\nThe tonally rich “Mikrokosmos II” makes reference to klezmer music in a mercurial transition that leads to wah-wah violin infusions. Hwang also employs this effect on the fantastic “Robo Call”, an explorative tune couched with a sturdy trombone riff and violin countermelody, an inviting groove in six, and a great harmonica solo that picks up exactly where the trombone left off. One can sense an abundance of life here, and that feel had already been conveyed on the piece that preceded it, “Laugh So You Don’t Cry”. Here, the rhythm team pilots the ship by adhering to a fast swinging acceleration, while the effusive clamoring is accented by Boston’s Cecil Taylor-esque abstractions and Bart’s serpentine itineraries.\nThese musicians work really well together, giving Swell’s compositions the stunning aesthetics they deserve. With no lessening of enthusiasm, The Center Will Hold is a dazzler of a record.\nFilipe Freitas, Jazz Trail",

            "about": "Distinguished jazz and improvisation artists, pianist Dave Burrell and trombonist Steve Swell have crafted one of the most exciting and unique duo presentations I've heard in quite some time. The album moniker Turning Point is the third in a series of five suites honoring the individuals and events of the American Civil War. Here, Burrell ruminates upon Civil War era Americana, integrated with a progressive jazz flair amid lofty improvisational sequences and humbly stated melodic choruses via the artists' respective sensibilities of this landmark event in American history.\nRecorded at the Library of the Free Library of Philadelphia, the duo mingles playful dialogues with bold exchanges, including Swell's gutsy and soul-drenched jazz lines, tinted with tremolo and blistering solo spots. Nonetheless, the musicians generate and reconstruct Civil War era stylizations, often heard by way of strings quartets or solo banjo and piano performances. Hence, Burrell's delicately executed melodies and rhythmically sculpted block chords capture this period in music, where sorrow and reflectiveness seemed to be the basis for simple, yet heartwarming harmonic motifs. However, pieces such as \"Church Picnic Celebration\" and \"Paradox of Freedom\" are fashioned with bluesy and drawling riffs and full throttle improv segments, contrasted by abstract variations and rollicking breakouts. It's so interesting to hear the jazz vernacular retuned in such a way.\nOn \"Fancy Trade Nightmare,\" Swell's raspy and down home lines ignite a sense of angst as Burrell quietly comps in the background; whereas, the final track \"Battle at Vicksburg\"—the final campaign of the Civil War —sounds like a eulogy, where closure is attained with Burrell's solemn voicings and moderate metrical flows. Otherwise, I'll go out on very a short limb, advising that Turning Point is a must listen for most if not all jazz aficionados.\nGlenn Astarita",
