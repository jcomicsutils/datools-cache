            "about": "“Dröm Sång,\" emerges as a poignant ballad, it blends melancholic melodies with an introspective narrative. Now available for pre-order, the new single will be available on 7-inch in two color variants, white and black, alongside the 2023 single \"Wanderer.\"\nRooted in a draft originally conceived during the Pale Swordsman sessions in 2021, “Dröm Sång” carries a familiar resonance, particularly reminiscent of the track \"Swordsman\" from the same album. However, its creation followed an unconventional path, with recording taking place under spontaneous, often cramped conditions across Berlin, Germany, and Tokyo, Japan.\nDespite its softer tone, \"Dröm Sång\" does not signal a departure from Këkht Aräkh’s black metal focus. The track remains a testament to the project's versatility, while staying true to its core ethos.",

The song was recorded in 2015 and released only 7 years after, on a compilation “Domains of the Deceased” by Livor Mortis.\nThe lyrics to the song were written by my friend, as my knowledge of English back then was too poor to write any. They were inspired by Japanese folklore and history.\nHome-made, unintentionally raw and sloppy, with lyrics full of grammar and spelling mistakes — this is what the project was like in its early days.\nThe track is available on the major streaming platforms.",

Recording took place in two different locations - Berlin, Germany, and Espoo, Finland. Every borrowed guitar and impromptu studio session became a vital thread in the song's intricate tapestry.\nWanja from Mrtva Vod lent his raw drumming, Chase, the Galrög from Lore Liege, played a crucial role in shaping the song's brooding sound, and Nick from IC3PEAK provided a creative haven for the visceral vocal work. The eerie tranquility of the Finnish woods delivered the necessary space for Këkht Aräkh to breathe life into the song. Here, the finishing touches were added - the delicate keys and haunting vocals.",
