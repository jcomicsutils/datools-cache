            "about": "With his move to Klammklang following a series of elegant yet deceptively unsettling noir techno records for Pinkman, Créme Organization and Phonica among the other labels, Art Crime has managed to consistently reinvent his sound, not only retaining the trademark melodism but improving it further and expanding far into the unknown. Composed and produced in a bedroom studio in downtown Moscow his new album exists in a private world apart from previously explored club music tropes.\nA Constant Lack is a testimony to Art Crime's subtle and fragile take on everything avant-garde and experimental. Opening with the hazy and intimate soundscapes of All The Paths To Go Down and ethereal piano samples in Skin Smell, the record then evolves into cascading sequences and imperfect chord progressions evoking the dance floor echoes to culminate with haunting minimalism of album's title piece and dramatic strings of closing track Relapse, A Constant Lack's emotional zenith. It is a brilliantly crafted and carefully selected collection of tracks, a thing of extensive, spellbinding beauty.",

            "about": "Aseptic Stir is a new project of the Berlin-based artist Alexandra Zakharenko, whose debut on Klammklang is an examination of sound by means of bodily practices. In ‘Year of Detachment’ she presents the intimate diary of self-study that transcends boundaries and exposes vulnerability through music, voice and movement, creating a subtle medium for desires to emerge.\nWoven from drones, hisses and noise, her album seemingly mimics heartbeats, echoes pulsing blood and rustlings of skin. It’s a continuous journey through the body to the transmutation of the libidinal into the liminal. Reflections on corporeal processes and movements, that express the inner self, appear to be so close to flesh and blood, you could hear emotions and desires boiling.\nDeeply immersed in overcoming the rift between mind and body, Aseptic Stir shows the ability of the latter to speak so clearly and unequivocally as no one verbally could. A thought always precedes a phrase, but it’s unable to predict actions of the Other. That’s exactly what ‘Year of Detachment’ does by establishing communication between sense and eroticism, revealing what is hidden to the consciousness.",

            "about": "Being both too vague for concrete music and too substantial for what one might call a 'conventional' music language, oo Flips directs the ear toward the denial. Denial of geographies, events, skills and any attempts to grab the Meaningful out of the hands of Chaos.\nAlthough chaotic is often interpreted as destructive, there is no sense of danger or violence in quiet and discrete sonic elements that are trying to coexist, though in most cases this cooperation means smashing into one another at the breakneck speed. Tiny grains of these sonorous events are being reconstructed constantly, as if there's an intention to face the mirror in every possible formation. So is Nikita Bugaev, who addresses himself as ‘nonmusician’, exploring ways to disconnect electronic music from the digital domain. Due to the short and rather 'raw' nature of tracks, those who listen might change their everyday roles and find themselves inside these seamless moments of magic when unintentional exercises and simply bringing bits of sounds together become music.\nIf there is an instrument to describe Nikita’s new artwork, it lies in our memory of intimately encountering sound objects like gently leaning on the table with our ear and hearing the whisper within the matter when the surface is being touched.",

            "about": "Sergei Demin was born in Eastern Siberia, in a small town of Lesosibirsk (literally translates as 'a forest Siberian town'). In 2016, after almost ten years of spinning records at finest local underground raves, he released his debut album Pangram on Klammklang. Since then, many things happen — i.e. Sergei moved to Netherlands to reside in a (yet another) small town of Hilversum. Anyway, we're very happy to have him back.\nIt's jungle here, served on a plate: ungrasped, decoded, dissected, wrecked and regenerated. The flux dismantled into tiny grains and transported to the the genres' outer realms where any signs stop making sense. It's at the point where all formal procedures turn into immersive hallucinations. Where semiotics descend into virotechnics. And while techno is about high frequency, jungle is about jungle is about jungle is about jungle is about jungle is about jungle is about jungle is about [ˈʤʌŋgl ɪz əˈbaʊt] [[[*[][][]] [* [ * ]] *[ ]]********* [*] *[ ]] *[][] [][][]**[][][]] [*[[]]]]] []* [*[[]]* ]][ ]]]*[][ ]]***** [*] *]]]**][**[][] [][] []**[]** [*] ******][] and HEAVY BASS.\nHowever you prefer working with sonic archetypes — please stop calling it 'deconstruction'.",

            "about": "Shchelkovo-based artist and sound researcher Diana Romanova appears on Klammklang with her debut «Exercice d'écoute non-humaine». Despite being composed out of multitude field recordings, it seems unnecessary to talk about this record as a collection of documented sound events or in a context of sound ecology. It is not about original sound sources or sonic preservation at all. It is about listening – the specific listening mode that makes me forget causal listening has ever excited.\n/ . .\nI open it. I am waiting.\nIt is happening twice. Stops.\nArises – rustling and soft.\nBlows.\nCrackles.\nDies.\nNot happening.\nAbsent.\nReappearing. The tiniest\nsound\nfeels\nlike\na deafening\nexplosion.\n. _\nExercice d'écoute non-humaine is a reflection on sounds beyond human hearing, not in a way that is not accessible to humans, but in a way that almost changes my organic structures, makes me transform into something beyond. In order to turn me into this extreme phenomenological listener, Diana’s compositions remain demanding. They do not guide me, they more likely show me the entry point – mutating and developing, they make me slow down, wait, live throughout blind spots, prick up my ears. It is the question of my attention how much of Diana’s sound universe I am capable to hear, see and feel with all my senses. When I am lucky to switch on this specific perception mode, while waiting in delusive «absence», trying to catch sounds and succeeding in it, I become more present than ever.\nBeing a synesthetic person, Diana talks about how she hears visual objects, sees sound or uses body in her practice to dance the music sometimes. In this case, six zines with its minimalistic graphics, replacing the conventional media such as cassettes, CDs and vinyl, feel the most non-obvious and fitting solution. Six zines are media for the six tracks, they give not guidelines but another entry. I am flipping though pages, I hold my gaze on the black spots. I hear dots. All my feelings are active. It is hard to imagine more correct representation of this music – resounding silence, restrained events that to the end feel massive and dense, than white space of the sheet and small drawn objects. I can literally touch the music pieces, participate even without playback. It is reflections on sounds beyond human hearing for sure, the sounds that should not be produced to remain sounds.\nFades away.\n. .\nI return to the real world, steady, attentive. I am an active subject, and from now I hear, see and feel more.",

            "about": "In the early days of Klammklang, Egor Klochikhin played a pivotal role in establishing our intentions to create an experiment-friendly musical platform and quickly became one of the label's defining artists. Following various multiple releases, installation and exhibition works, Egor has returned to Klammklang to release the new conceptual album Karaul, his first record in the label in over the last four years.\nSound-wise, Karaul is set to represent Foresteppe's recent musical styles evolved out of the label's back catalogue highlights – a conceptual tape collage Kosichkin Tapes (Klamm05) made up of pieces, splices, and overlapping layers of half-anonymous Soviet-era home recordings, and his solo masterpiece Diafilms (Klamm08) featuring Egor's trademark post-folk sound. Nevertheless, Karaul goes beyond what one might expect from Foresteppe's album, combining a vast palette of drones and noises with some brushstrokes of power electronics, martial industrial and even meticulously deconstructed club music shaded by the artist's more accustomed tools: acoustic guitar, tape machines, all sorts of toy pianos, pipes, horns and other implements of previously usual freaky electroacoustic ambience. This archeo-modern musical shape of things that came was inspired by Egor's solitary instance of mandatory military service – a rather traumatic experience commonly spread among many Russian young men.\nThe word 'karaul' designates both a kind of pompous sentry, mundane army guarding duty, and bitterly humorous call for help in horrific cases along. All of these meanings rhyme perfectly with the motto of Strategic Missile Forces, Egor’s former service troops: \"После нас – тишина\" (‘Après nous, le silence’). But the silence appearing here is not only the silence of ashen wastes covering the Earth's surface after a missile strike. It's also the inner, personal silence in lack of emotions to the bunk neighbour in barracks; it's the silence of thousands souls and bodies stomped the parade ground before. It's the silence of imaginary presence of military Golden Age – a failed fiction of propaganda forces, whose inability of chaining the individuals into the ruthless machine still works even in traumatising situations of what one might call a separated male brotherhood.\nIt was told once to the protagonist in Masaki Kobayashi’s Ningen no jōken: ‘A brave man will always find a kindred spirit’. However, what if this spirit could not be found in the circle of obliged? The time starts to run into the joint again; a brave man begins to search the weapon against victimisation in mind of his own and minds long gone. Karaul stands for this exact matter. Think of it as of a field journal of non-inclusion into enclosed repressive system and guide of non-alignment in ‘the more you think, the worse grows fear’ circumstances.\n⏚\n\"Foresteppe выпустил новый альбом “Karaul”\nСлужба в армии никого не опускает сразу. Дембельские истории надолго поселяются в повседневном репертуаре и становятся неиссякаемым источником баек и внутренней воронкой, которую хочется заполнить обычной жизнью\nУчитывая, что все государственные организации (а также любые объединения, формирования и другие формы существования) - это и есть государство в миниатюре, армейские будни дают чётко понять, как всё устроено\nЕгор Клочихин отслужил в ракетных войсках и полученный опыт оформил в звуковое полотно. Даже уместнее сказать, “в ветошь”, которая заполнила всю обложку. Сам Егор в шутку назвал жанр этой пластинки “дембель-эмбиентом”, что довольно метко отражает её настроение\nОднако передать все эмоции звуками одного эмбиента, которым Foresteppe владеет очень хорошо, недостаточно. Поэтому выход из зоны комфорта здесь происходит самым жёстким способом - привычная форма разламывается индастриалом (“Almaz // Radian”), впадает в дроуновый ступор (“Smena Smen”) и всё время где-то маячит ощущение тревоги\nНо это ощущение не из-за подготовки к войне или ожидания врага, оно идёт изнутри, где мирно дремало пока его не разбудили жернова милитаристской мельницы\nЗвуки на пластинке намекают, что “караул” здесь означает не только несение службы, но и крик о помощи, который остаётся неуслышанным, как и вся лирика на альбоме\nКстати, лирика показательна, но с ней лучше ознакомиться отдельно, например, на странице альбома на Bandcamp, потому что расслышать её сложно. Она присутствует только в двух треках - “Almaz // Radian” и “lil one”, представляя собой грубоватые выдержки из армейских высказываний и гордые строчки о солдатском звании\nНо все они, подобно ветоши, имеют прикладное значение и уделять им внимания стоит не больше, чем простому расходному материалу. Потому что в отличие от напускного дембельского бахвальства, здесь интересна сама музыка, которая наполнена живым человеческим наблюдением за жерновами огромного бездушного механизма\"\nt.me/akuliymalchish/300",

            "about": "Almost two years down the line from his debut on Gost Zvuk, one of Russia's most prominent labels of today, Moscow's INFX appears on Klammklang with another outlandish take on electronic music's current zeitgeist in Consume Your Own Identity.\nWith his background as visual artist, it feels like INFX is treating the acoustic space in the same three-dimensional fashion using sound as a more tangible agent to explore the effects of attention and anticipation. The moment you start to perceive this music as a peculiar sonic sculpture inside your brain, it turns into a spatio-temporal whirlwind. Patterns fall apart and the amusing sound you just discovered in between rhythms gets immediately dissolved in yet another disruptive timbre. You expect things to happen, but they prefer not to. Sometimes it causes vertigo, but the whole experience is like the most fabulous roller coaster ride one can imagine. Existing on the margins of various electronic music genres, Consume Your Own Identity is not about the frustrated expectation, but the primal expression. Rich in textures and frequencies, focused on dynamics it's not abstract at all. It's corporeal as f**k.",

            "about": "Over the course of more than 10 years, since the beginning of the 70-ies to the first half of the 80-ies, the head of an ordinary Soviet family, using a reel tape machine, recorded songs sung by his wife, poems recited by his children, his favourite music played from vinyl and aired on the radio and lots of other things. Miraculously, the archive remained intact. The new Klammklang release is a collage pieced together from these recordings.",

            "about": "«А не кажется ли вам иногда, Князь, что мы сейчас живем на переломе истории? Никогда не появляется у вас это ощущение? На переломе истории ужасно неуютно: сквозит, пахнет, тревожно, страшно, ненадежно, но с другой стороны - счастлив, кто посетил сей мир в его минуты роковые...»\n– Аркадий и Борис Стругацкие, «Отягощенные злом»\n_______________\n«Did it ever occur to you, Prince, that now we are living at the turning point of history? Have you ever had this feeling? The turning point feels terribly uncomfortable: there's a draught here, a smell, anxiety, fear, insecurity, but on the other hand — how fortunate are those who visited the world in its fateful minutes...»\n– Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, «Those Burdened By Evil»\nAlthough the quote above may seem to convey a potentially profound meaning, it is merely a plain description of how we see the world today. And this is the idea which lies behind our first ever label compilation.\nFortunately, music doesn't care about your place of birth and skin colour, gender and sexual orientation, age and social class. Most likely it won't change the world, but at least it can make it a better place – there's nothing magical and esoteric about that fact.\nOur modest contribution is the selection of these twelve tracks from artists around the world: Russia and Ukraine, Germany and USA, Kazakhstan and Siberia.\nWishing you a year of strength, happiness, faith and love.",

            "about": "VII is dedicated to Klammklang's seventh year of existence, and, coincidentally, this is also our seventh release in 2020. But rather than recollecting the past, this compilation is intended to be a statement towards our label's further evolution.\nI. DEBUTS\nThe album starts with an electroacoustic etude pour saxophone, gong, bass guitar and field recordings by label's debutant Kolya Dykhne, a Moscow-based sound and visual artist who creates some outlandish musical objects, instruments, sculptures and paintings. We're also thrilled to present a piece by another young muscovite Diana Romanova, an upcoming neo-concrète composer with her special taste to subtle sounds semi-existing between the long periods of silence.\nII. DUETS\nIt's already been more than two years since we've been working with Vlad Dobrovolski, and the man never fails to surprise. What he brought to the table once was this amazing composition Vlad made together with Sugai Ken, a renowned Japanese experimental composer. And thus, the duo's multifaceted blend of timbres, melodies, textures and found sounds has became the compilation's first building block. Another joint effort on VII is an edited fragment of live performance that was held in the studio of Berlin's Cashmere Radio. This one is a collaboration between two outstanding sound artists based in Germany's capital city: Hugo Esquinca (a part of Klammklang extended international fam) with his digital algorithms processing the inimitable vocal oscillations of Audrey Chen, a Chinese/Taiwanese-American artist discovering the possibilities of human voice. Last but not least, there's another debut backed by one Klammklang's key artists Nikita Bugaev, and also another attempt to set up a dialogue between a voice and software, where Nikita has designed a virtual space for an audiovisual artist Elina Bolshenkova's chants and uttered incantations.\nIII. DOCUMENTS\nDocumenting sound was one of our main courses for years, so we had no choice but to add a few here. First of all, there are some bits of Kirstine Elisa Kjeldsen's sound performance at the club Mózg in Bydgoszcz, Poland where the Danish-born, Berlin-based artist had showcased her very own, walls-shattering approach to processed feedback. VII's final track is a documentation of Egor Klochikhin aka Foresteppe's kinetic/sonic installation he made last year for an art exhibition in Novosibirsk, for which he utilised three reel-to-reel tape machines and a bunch of voice recordings related to the Soviet pastimes — from a speech of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, to an interview with the prominent literary scholar and semiotician Yuri Lotman.\nIV—V—VI—VII. ... AND WHATEVER COMES NEXT\nThree years after her brilliant debut record Zangezur, we are to release the new album by Lusia Kazaryan-Topchyan aka Margenrot — a Moscow-based artist and performer who puts together everything noisy, punk-ish and ethnical. Another Russian artist we proud to have on board is Zurkas Tepla; and while we're all patiently waiting for his new full-length to come in 2021, there's an archival composition demonstrating his trademark uneasy and alarming musical styles. The next year will also mark the Klammklang debut for Felicity Mangan, an Australian sound and composer based in Berlin and known for her in-depth research of biophonic and geophonic sonic entities. For VII she composed the short-yet-effective piece utilising the field recordings made by KK's Stas Sharifullin at Matovo village (Kaluga Oblast), Vlad Dobrovolski's secret summer hideout.\nArtists links (in alphabetical order):\nAudrey Chen —  www.audreychen.com\nDiana Romanova —  soundcloud.com/diaromma\nEgor Klochikhin —  foresteppe.bandcamp.com\nElina Bolshenkova —  soundcloud.com/elinabolshenkova\nFelicity Mangan —  felicitymangan.org\nHugo Esquinca —  www.dekj.org\nKirstine Elisa Kjeldsen —  www.kirstineelisakjeldsen.com\nKolya Dykhne —  instagram.com/enhkyd.aylok\nMargenrot —  soundcloud.com/margenrot\nNikita Bugaev —  neccss.bandcamp.com\nSugai Ken —  sugaiken.bandcamp.com\nVlad Dobrovolski —  www.dobrovolski.net\nZurkas Tepla —  www.zurkastepla.com",

            "about": "Bringing joy and enormous amount of energy, the UK-based open-ended performance group Katz Mulk join Klammklang with their new full-length Vital Attachments, a documentation of their performances commissioned for the 2019 editions of the Counterflows and Experimentica festivals. Katz Mulk are a many headed hydra, working with sound, voice, movement, sculpture and more, transgressing it into vigorous and multifaceted artworks on the margins of various genres and media.\n\"look at the space from a low angle and feel the floor\" — says the graphic score for the performance. It seems important to follow the instructions so the peculiar sonic events reach your spine, skin, and bones through the floor surface. This music expects you to change your habitual vertical position, reconfigure your senses — to actually use all of them simultaneously while absurdly directing your gaze upwards. The graphic piece with lines and not-so-figurative pictures, despite being an artifact of the particular event, establishes space for participation; it weirdly welcomes everyone to enter the sonic space, explore it, and to see what is being heard at the moment.\nThe documentation is powerful in its totality — it is not only interesting to listen to, it also encourages on to watch it, dance it, touch it, smell it. Vital is pervasive, it is chaotic as well, but Katz Mulk’s chaos is somehow organized. Structured rhythms are trying to withhold restless sound improvisations and voices that are ready to burst from rapid changes, shifting from one ear to another. The structure reveals a mess. Altogether, dance patterns, vague fragments of narrative, raw vocals, graphic schemes, and instructions are giving hints, not a full picture and, for sure, not serenity. This music might have been a lucky finding fallen from outer space, with the sound of nature that is being unexpectedly mixed with very grounded music of our present in the stratosphere somewhere. It carries you to a state you have never thought you would end up in, an almost inhuman state in-between, but in the end the most human and lively one can imagine. As if this state uncovers parts of a human body that have been hidden, but, as vital and irreplaceable, are always there.",

            "about": "Enclosed in a case sparkling like ice, our final release of the year takes the traditional form of sound collage assembled by Lisa Smirnova – a Moscow-based artist locally famous for mind-bending DJ sets, who finally breaks out of the comfort zone and makes her debut as a producer. The result is a hybrid album/mixtape blending together 28 tracks from the label's back catalogue – all sliced, cut into pieces and set back together to reflect Klammklang's current zeitgeist. Each copy comes with a silver pendant, exclusively designed and manufactured by SUMEI, Lisa's very own minimalist jewelry brand.\nIn 2019 our label turns six, and this release ultimately marks the end of what we've ironically called the Golden Age of Klammklang – early days in Siberia, happy and carefree (or at least that's how we see it today in a rather romanticised manner). Thus, the silver pendant might seem as quite a straightforward metaphor: summer's leaving, winter's coming. Nevertheless, while usually people think of winter as something dark and gloomy, for us it's time of peace – and what's more important, it's time of hope.\nIt's December now, but there's no snow in Moscow, and no sun either. By the end of the decade it's quite easy to be pessimistic about the future. But whatever comes next, it's great just to be here around the people you met on the way, staying strong together and waiting for the snow to come and enfold your sorrows.\nThere's certainly a long way to go, but has it ever been about the destination?",

            "about": "The debut album by Siberia-born, Moscow-based artist Lusia Kazaryan-Topchyan – a dark and mesmerising journey into the subterranean, inspired by her Armenian roots and murky sounds of 80-90s industrial music.\n______\n\"Margenrot is the solo project of Moscow-based musician Lusia Kazaryan-Topchyan, who also used to sing and play keys for the iconic post-punk band Fanny Kaplan. Her solo endeavor explores more intriguing sonic territories by merging Eastern flavors with gloomy industrial rhythms and atmospheres.\nThe album shares its name with a conflict-ridden historical region in southeast Armenia. Margenrot’s inspiration, however, goes beyond geopolitics, and is rooted in the myth of the region’s name. According to Armenian folklore, the name Zangezur came into use after Timur’s conquest, who conquered the Syunik province after a renegade Armenian prince sabotaged the area’s alarm bells. As the province fell, its inhabitants wondered why the bells never rang, giving birth to the phrase “the ring is in vain,” or “zange zur” in Armenian\".\n– INRUSSIA\ninrussia.com/ridges-of-zangezur",

            "about": "The endless journey of Mårble, aka Siberia-born and Saint Petersburg-based Anton Glebov, takes a pit stop on Klammklang, with his seventh (and the darkest yet) full-length. 'Criminal Russia' is a patchwork travelogue arranged by blurred dubs, quasi-tropicalia, animistic jazz and quirky fourth worldtronica, which compose a sonorous body equally suitable for tribal dances in one's own room as for the group meditation on the dancefloor. A surrealistic path through the urban jungle of a replicated Saint Petersburg, one which is marked with unexpected meetings, strange attractions and eerie occurrences. These dynamic reaches an apex in 'Criminal Russia' with the participation of Slavic Ipatov in sax&rhythm bomb 'Coco Dub' and Minereed’s synth waves on 'Tsarstvo' and 'Jablochki'.\nAnton’s peek into the underside of modern human myth is that of the reflector, which conversely acts as a false looking glass, one that constantly distorts the visible (and hearable) image. Its projections appear ambiguously spectacular and horrendous, weird or stupendous, yet they still display the fragility and complexity of verbal language anticipating a musical one. The highlighting of such contradictions, are joyfully transformed into an act of anomalous beauty, one driven not with fear and wish to possess, but only with the interest to caress.",

One from the city, the other from the countryside; growing in diverse settings, one closer to the human presence, the other to the animal kingdom. As the first had to imagine a world, building stories and construct phantasies, the latter always had it close. Having their backgrounds in visual arts and sharing mutual interest in musical expression, they've been exchanging their sounds, exuding and absorbing from each other. Thus, this album is the first ever documented report of the ongoing collaboration.\nDeveloped through free improvisation sessions, Lettere Animali consists of eleven pieces exploring the analogy between not thinking and acting by instinct (like an animal would do) through both spontaneous interaction between musicians and next ensuing studio arrangements. These compositions might be seen as \"animal letters\" addressed to the listener, and that's exactly where the album name comes from. It's the music of beautiful contrasts and paradoxes: it's structured but also liberated from the usual framework of Western composition; it's highly melodic and making it easy to follow, but still remains challenging while utilizing some non-obvious timbres, rhythms and techniques. It's full of beautiful biophonic recordings, masterly integrated into the musical context, so it's a bit utopian as well. If we imagine only for a moment that it's still not too late for humans and animals to co-exist in harmony, listening to each other could be the missing link.",

            "about": "\"Listening to Tepla’s work can initially feel like being strapped in a very fast-moving vehicle, buffeted by the rush of the creative energy swirling about you. You may also flinch each time you experience the assault of various gradations of sonic scree thrown at you. It’s only later, maybe in retrospect, that you can piece together the structures that give form to the whole\" - The Quietus\nMoscow-based experimentalist Zurkas Tepla debuts on Klammklang with his fourth album, a long awaited follow-up to his records previously released with Forest Swords' Dense Truth label and Karelian Full of Nothing imprint. Lurking in the overlapping shadows of musique spectrale and musique concrete, post club tendencies and some of the most abrasive noises you'll ever hear, Occasion Smell is not a decontextualized matter as it may seem. While completely instrumental, the album deploys sonic bodies which develop its own language, producing a cryptic semblance of narratives.\nThe six tracks present the listener with distinctive, yet interrelated sonorous traces, covering a multifaceted span of harmonic and textural mise-en-scènes. From the haunting intermitting synthetic strings merging the halting bass line of the opening sequence in Kazus Perevodchika to the album's counterpoints Rehearsal of Repeat and Pets Conversation resonating in a WWII Messiaen meeting Tristan Murail and Gérard Grisey, to the stalking rhythms of the album's ending title Dirt Digging Nose resembling some of Chicago's finest TRAXXX, Zurkas Tepla hands over some of his most lunatic ideas through a solid, multifarious, conceptual full-length. It's an uneasy but equally rewarding experience.\n+It has some PDF with comic book inside. Great conversation starter.\n\"What’s most disconcerting here, though, is the sense you might be the only human left in this nightmarish place. Sure, wastelands of concrete and glass abound, and the smoke of some recent disaster still lingers, but listening to “White Hands Washed Eye Black Gas” and “Estrade Variety” just might have you wondering where everybody’s gone\" - Live Eye Tv",
