            "about": "\"A Cosmic stomper and highest recommendations!\" Edward Ka-Spel\n“The emphasis is definitely on the “Journey” as mysterious drone-meets-psychedelia act Armchair Migraine Journey embarks on this new trip. Beginning with a medley of dark ambient drones, buzzes, fades and washes, MAGNETIC BLOOD DROWNING, the initial offering on the two-track Blood Coupling Magnet, lays on thick atmosphere before coalescing into a dark psych-rock jam backed by distortion-drenched drums. In the fashion of the best and most “out there” prog, it effortlessly skirts the line between noise and melody; just when you think things are turning into a morass of self-indulgent feedback, the guitar pulls back just enough to get your head nodding again to the moody Krautrock-inspired rhythm. The second composition, REBIRTH BLOOD ΩM, shifts even more drastically, traveling further out into the sonic and philosophical void. Industrial rock drums and heavy overdriven guitar chords straight out of some early Pigface demo open things before suddenly giving way to the gentlest ambient, delicately drawn out chiming tones over a quiet heartbeat punctuated by heavy breaths. Soon, the otherworldly growling trance-drone of Tuvan throat-singing—courtesy of Soriah's Enrique Ugalde—brings the ethereal down to earth. A Buddhist mantra, sung by Prajna, forms the backbone to the song's latter half, as the throat-singing takes turns with a fuzzed out, effects-drenched tanpura to follow the melody of the chant, drifting in and out of harmony with Prajna's voice. Cosmic, earthy, ominous, uplifting and even spiritual, Blood Coupling Magnet is sonically fascinating, but more than that, it's emotionally affecting. Plenty of experimental music can manage to do interesting things with your head (especially if you're that breed of music nerd that likes to spend time thinking about experimental music) but Blood Coupling Magnet works its way into your gut, too.” Matthew Johnson",

            "about": "“Cosmic Space Drone” lives up to its name, travelling into the deepest void, its gaping maw swallowing up meteoric dust and wayward celestial souls alike to fuel its endless journey into the infinite. Your journey will follow two long tracks, the first a fuzzy, electronic spacerock whiplash effect that surges and shudders, wrenching you away from the scorched earth and all that you know. Once escape velocity is achieved, you will find yourself drifting ever further from home, your only company the thrum and hum of the engines - a soundtrack for a doomed crew. Is it grim, even frightening? Yes, at times. But it’s your only hope for survival -and you’ll thank us when your friends are nothing but smoldering cinders on a world gone mad. So don’t delay! Buy your brain a ticket to ride on these tracks of tachyons, but be warned: this is a one way trip into uncharted territories where ancient machines hum and throb to the forgotten rhythms of distant long-dead pulsars. Once the polychrome porter punches your ticket, there is no hope of return - your consciousness will slowly cook in a churning, burning dark matter stew simmering slowly in a cosmic cauldron. Please, sir, may I have some more?",

We will attempt reconnection. Transmutation of genetic code will soon be online again. Our agents are working to fulfill your orders. You may continue transmitting, though be warned: your signal may be transformed beyond recognition. You may experience dizziness and disorientation as you acclimate to the new medium. Armchair Migraine Journey can not be held responsible for lost luggage, missed connections or broken synapses. Hurry up now! The signal flows at a breakneck pace. Chop chop! Splice Splice! Don't be afraid of the space between the genomes. The eyes in the back of our heads will illuminate the passage. Nuclei erupted and chromosomes corrupted, it's a buzzsawed jigsaw of something nature never intended! It isn't pretty, but a re-scripted biological imperative screams: Get the message across before it's too late! Stop wallowing in primordial soup! Transmit! Mutation! Drone! Transmit. Mutation. Drone.\nTwo: The new limbs have been difficult to integrate and the birth canal has proven far too delicate for this new form. Additionally, the maternal host has displayed an unexpected reaction to sudden interference in telepathic signals. We must insure survival. Transmission must be completed, despite increased risk to the carrier. Initiate somatic response. Anesthetize the host and commence processing the signal. Engage dream sequence 11-B. Ensure the host's comfort. Complete phase cancellation will remove outward stimuli. Soothing images may distract the patient from any aural discomfort. Neurosurgical team on standby. The engineers have been briefed. Wait… wait… We have contact! The signal has awakened! Hurry! Complete the circuit! Transmit! Mutation! Drone!",

            "about": "Part One features Ty Hodson on bowed cymbals and Pascal Godjikian (La STPO) on vocals/lyrics.\nTransmit. Mutation. Drone. One: Transmigration: done. Your call could not be completed. We will attempt reconnection. Transmutation of genetic code will soon be online again. Our agents are working to fulfill your orders. You may continue transmitting, though be warned: your signal may be transformed beyond recognition. You may experience dizziness and disorientation as you acclimate to the new medium. Armchair Migraine Journey can not be held responsible for lost luggage, missed connections or broken synapses. Hurry up now! The signal flows at a breakneck pace. Chop chop! Splice Splice! Don't be afraid of the space between the genomes. The eyes in the back of our heads will illuminate the passage. Nuclei erupted and chromosomes corrupted, it's a buzzsawed jigsaw of something nature never intended! It isn't pretty, but a re-scripted biological imperative screams: Get the message across before it's too late! Stop wallowing in primordial soup! Transmit! Mutation! Drone!\nTransmit. Mutation. Drone. Two: The new limbs have been difficult to integrate and the birth canal has proven far too delicate for this new form. Additionally, the maternal host has displayed an unexpected reaction to sudden interference in telepathic signals. We must insure survival. Transmission must be completed, despite increased risk to the carrier. Initiate somatic response. Anesthetize the host and commence processing the signal. Engage dream sequence 11-B. Ensure the host's comfort. Complete phase cancellation will remove outward stimuli. Soothing images may distract the patient from any aural discomfort. Neurosurgical team on standby. The engineers have been briefed. Wait… wait… We have contact! The signal has awakened! Hurry! Complete the circuit! Transmit! Mutation! Drone!",
