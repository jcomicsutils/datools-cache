            "about": "\"Behind the hills when sinks the western sun,\nAnd falling dews breathe fragrance thro' the air,\nRefreshing every field with coolness mild:\nThen let me walk the twilight meadows green,\nOr breezy up-lands, near thick-branching elms,\nWhile the still landscape sooths my soul to rest,\nAnd every care subsides to calmest peace:\nThe mists slow-rising from the rivers dank,\nThe woods scarce stirring at the whispering wind,\nThe streaky clouds, that tinge their darken'd tops\nWith russet hues, and fainter gleams of light,\nThe solitude that all around becalms\"\n-Thomas Warton, excerpt from \"Five Pastoral Eclogues\" (1770)\n---\n'A Balm of Conduction' is the twenty-ninth Sleepbuilding broadcast to be published, originally recorded overnight on May 12, 2023. It is an exploration of the Mixolydian scale using a wavetable voice within Expert Sleepers' Disting Mk4 multipurpose module. As of this writing, it was the oldest broadcast from the archive of unpublished sessions, and was chosen for release solely for this fact.\nMusically, 'Conduction' resembles distant horns, or woodwinds, blown from across a wide-open landscape, calling home weary travelers. It feels like an apt piece of music for a Summer that has been filled with heavy rain and gloomy news from all corners of the globe, a soporific sedative to force the brain and body to relax a little, to disconnect from the noise of the world and perhaps try to keep ourselves from losing too much of the hope that offsets the darkness.\nSometimes, I just need music to take me out of situational stress, nothing more and nothing less, and that is what a release like 'Conduction' is designed to do. I hope it offers a similar method of transport across this uncertain gradient for you too, if and when you need one.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "A Blanket Of Infinite Repetitions - released seven years ago during a humid June in subtropical South Carolina. As with many Milieu recordings, the weather and atmosphere played a huge part in influencing what went onto those miles of tape, and how fast or slow it actually happened. ABOIR was created using custom hand-cut tape loops for my Roberts 450A reel to reel machine, in conjunction with an extensive rig of outboard FX like loopers, reverbs, delays and low pass filters. Into this system, I played the ever-present Lowrey organ, and a little guitar (if memory serves), lazily plinking away at notes until the tape loops and delay repeats started to self-oscillate, but never feeding back. It was designed to maintain itself just at that precipice of spinning around in circles but never quite moving anywhere or losing momentum. The resulting sounds were backed by a recording of the room itself, during my preparation between takes, running through the tape machine and FX, painting a unique sonic image of a sun-warmed workshop slowly filling up with a colorful fog. Thin membranes of midrange and bedroom texture between 10,000-14,000 kHz gently ebbing along for forty minutes, in some moments even providing a precursory take on the approach that would define Phosphene Weather and Thriambus later.\nFor the occasion of renewing and reviving ABOIR in this breezy Daytonian valley I now reside in, I felt it appropriate to go back to the original tape rips and generate a Coppice Halifax excavation of the source material. This mix utilizes all five of the original ABOIR recordings in their most raw state, and builds itself using only those things as source. It provides a rich, slightly denser counterpoint to the album tracks - if ABOIR is the Summer air, then the CH excavation is the Spring rain-drenched Earth beneath it.\nAdditionally, returning to these cassettes has yielded a new extended drone mix of the entire record, issued separately as a 2xCD set titled Accumulation States:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/aboir-accumulation-states",
            "credits": "released April 21, 2017\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Rolling Knoll, Spring-Summer 2009. #6 remixed & produced by Coppice Halifax using only the original cassette recordings. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at White Pillar Workshop, April 2017. This is Milieu Music number AD30, and issue #30 in the Arboreal Digest reissue catalog.",

Recording for the album ended with the closing track \"Xanadu\", improvised live over Independence Day fireworks. Originally released on a limited CD-R edition at Milieu Music in 2005 with no catalog number designate, and then issued as a free download at Rope Swing Cities in 2007. Additionally, the tracks \"Seashell Breeze\", \"Slumber Notes\" and \"Xanadu\" appeared in edited forms on the 2006 album Night Currents at U-Cover. Available here for the first time ever in FLAC format.",

            "about": "One of the earlier entries in the Milieu canon, A DUSTY BOX OF OLD MEMORIES originated as an informal cassette, filling two sides of improvisations on a forgettable Casio keyboard, a few FX pedals and a four track tape machine. It was another hot Carolinian Summer in Columbia, June or July of 2005, and my wife and I had just moved into our first actual house together. There was pretty much zero furniture, I don't even think we had a bed yet, and all of our collective belongings were still in stacks of boxes that no one had any energy left to unpack.\nThe situation struck me as mundane and profound at the same time, a moment of surrealistic-domestic alignment, some kind of a lucid moment that shocked me into the sense that childhood was over, that adult years had arrived. So, in both the need to roll tape and document whatever this newly minted moment was, as well as the naive urge to refute the implication of \"adulthood\", I set myself up on the carpet of what would soon become my first don't-call-it-a-studio space, with the window overlooking my front porch, chimes, green lawn and both the Columbia water tower and Birch Park across the street. I'd unboxed a cheap Casio keyboard that was given to me for free, along with various FX pedals leftover from my several years of pretending to be in a rock band, my tape deck and an accompanying box of old tapes and photos.\nThe old tapes, as you may or may not be able to hear, were themselves used as instruments here, being sampled in different ways on 'Daisies' and 'Dry L.S.F. Station' among other less apparent moments on the album. The photographs could also be considered as voices in this session, which were shots from all different eras of my growing up, plus a couple notable old photos of my grandparents on my mother's side - my grandfather pushing a plow on his farm, my grandmother wearing a dress on a park bench - which ended up as the original two cover photographs for the public editions of this album. The album became complete when I filled the second side with a single lengthy improvisation over/under a Radio Shack microphone placed in the bedroom window, recording Fourth of July fireworks outside in our new neighborhood.\nIt was issued first later that year as a simple ink-stamped CD-R in a papersleeve via my homely Milieu Music imprint, which at the time was totally just a badly-designed website I coded by hand in Notepad, with some PayPal cart buttons and maybe even some MP3s as samples? In the pre-Bandcamp world, things were different, and Milieu Music's formative years were closer to a punk rock mailorder catalogue than anything it resembles now. One year following the Milieu Music CD-R, aspects of the album were included on NIGHT CURRENTS, my second album for the Belgian label U-Cover, which was most likely the first time many listeners interacted with these pieces. In late 2007, the full album was given a wider release through Rope Swing Cities, a netlabel helmed by Josh23, who was rooming with Ten and Tracer at the time, issued in high-fidelity 192 KBPS MP3 format. It wasn't until a full eight years later that I remastered the album at my Botany Bay studio, and mined the two CH remixes (Membrane / Dusty Acre) from the original session tapes, and these recordings themselves would wait another three years before seeing a release on a limited edition cassette at Illuminated Paths, the DIY imprint that also brought you first editions of DAUGHTER and the Party Mix of SHALLOW EARTH. Once again, two more years have passed from even that recent map marker, and for the first time ever, the remastered and expanded edition of A DUSTY BOX sees a complete presentation in lossless digital format, with new artwork taken once again from the archives of my grandparents' photo albums.\nAll of this history, and I have barely discussed the music itself. How very me. Well, by now I couldn't be faulted for assuming most people who are familiar with Milieu are also aware of this album, but for the newcomers, who I do not wish to alienate or invalidate, but welcome: This album is a warm blanket of many of the ambient sounds, melodic motifs and crumbly textures that are the sum total of synaesthetic comfort for me. The music is pretty, but also a bit disconnected, held back minimalistically not out of a desire to be minimal, but rather, an inability to know my way around a keyboard, at least back then. It could be argued that what I lacked in technical ability, I gained in ambition, and many early Milieu recordings seem to illustrate this sense of reaching past what my capabilities were, sometimes for better and sometimes for worse, but trying to grow through these aching waveforms all the same. Fifteen years later, listening to these sounds now, I feel filled with a charming sense of naivete, fully aware of the fact that even five years in my own creative continent is a lifetime of distance, so fifteen years is truly ancient history. I am, more than anything, glad that I took the time and spent the effort recording these improvisations, encapsulating a moment that may have otherwise been forgotten, or at best, eroded down to a funny feeling in the back of your mind, a sense of deja vu, instead of this object you now see before you, that both of us can interact with and revisit as often as we like. These recordings are even better than the memories themselves, because they haven't aged the way human recall itself has, and now, here in a snowed-in basement studio in Ohio, remembering feels voyeuristic, but it still feels like me, it still feels like home.\nNOTE: The Coppice Halifax remixes are also available separately as digital downloads here:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/dusty-acre",

            "about": "\"A Pentacle in Red Sapphire\" collects five minimalist pieces that were recorded on June 24th, 2022, documenting the patching process with my modular system that subsequently became the first step towards \"Transient Logics.\"\nIt consists of two modules from the Buchla 200 system - the 258t dual-oscillator and the 281t Quad Function Generator - exploring the Mixolydian (1/3/5) and Whole Tone (2/4) scales through the soft-focus lens of Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay and Mutable Instruments' Clouds granular resampling processors. The Mixolydian pieces were sequenced using the Sequins dual-channel sequencer in Ornament & Crime, with timing information coming from Cute Labs' Missed Opportunities (a subtractive divider with probabilistic outputs) in both clocked and non-clocked modes. Certain takes were also aided by Behringer's remake of the ARP 2600 \"Blue Marvin\" synthesizer, particularly its low-frequency noise generator and spring reverb tank. The Whole Tone pieces were reduced down to loop studies, using the Quantermain sequencer in Ornament & Crime, this time utilizing the integer sequence digsum(n) (or digital sum) to provide the sequencing (  oeis.org/A007953  )\nFollowing that initial session, the five pieces offered here were final-glossed and mastered over two years later at the end of the Summer season in 2024, using various processors from Arturia and Airwindows (including some DSP designed to reproduce the plate reverb at Abbey Road) to shape the more primordial material into what you now hear.\nWhat emerged from this lengthy process of working was something that I did not feel would fit particularly well in the Vibratelepathos catalog, where it was most likely to end up, and this was mostly to do with the fact that there were five inseparable sessions rather than just one or two. \"Pentacle\" is thus situated somewhere between a Vibra session and a much lengthier overnight session from the Sleepbuilding series, perhaps again prosaically reiterating its fundamental association with \"Transient Logics,\" which accumulated no less than one Coppice Halifax album and two Milieu albums of four and five discs each respectively.\n\"Pentacle\" exists apart from those albums, formally, as it is far less composed and more experimental than the \"Logics\" recordings, but in thinking about them adjacent to one another, I like to think of \"Pentacle\" as being the \"weltlandschaft\" in the background of \"Transient Logics\" - a distant and wide-open vista of diffused color and light, with great mountains that are so tall they can be seen from impossibly far away, reduced to dark waveforms drawn across a deep horizon line.",

            "about": "\"O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you,\nAs I walk by your side or sit near, or remain in the same room with you,\nLittle you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake is playing within me.\"\n-Walt Whitman\n'A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods' was originally broadcast for about fourteen hours from the evening of December 27th to the afternoon of December 28th, 2022. It is a piece of generative music, created with the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, primarily focusing upon the Karplus-Strong synthesizer within Noise Engineering's Versio module (running Spectra mode in the user-designed Multi Versio firmware), which played soft and fuzzy ambient music in a custom scale. I revisited the patch two different times during the night, each time in a progressively more relaxed and sleepy state, which allowed for three distinct variations to materialize.\nThis recording follows November's 'Creation' in form and function, and is designed as a name-your-price longform ambient work that I hope will offer you some relief from the world when it is tiresome, and also enrich that same world when you are ready to return to it. There is no right or wrong way to use this recording, and I encourage listeners to experiment with it as if it were a renewable utility in their day to day lives.\nTwelve hours of the original broadcast were captured and archived at YouTube here:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=csaqqBaYTOk\nPATCH NOTES:\nVoice: Noise Eng Multi Versio (Spectra mode)\nSequencing: Multi Versio (Custom tuned scale)\nTiming: Cute Labs Missed Opportunities, Blue Lantern CMOS Party (Boolean) + Doepfer A-160-1 divider\nFilters: 2HP LPF, Doepfer A-121-3 LPF\nModulation: Behringer 150, Buchla 266t Source of Uncertainty\nFX: Mutable Inst Clouds (Vanilla)\nMixer: Behringer 305, Zoom H1",

            "about": "\"Fall to the Earth, for That alone is fixt.\"\n-Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea (1713)\n---\n\"A Stone Arch in the Wilderness\" is the 34th Sleepbuilding broadcast to be mastered and published. As with all prior 33 releases in the Sleepbuilding series, it is a free download. It was originally streamed overnight on 5th November 2024, in the perhaps vain hope of offering some respite from the oppressive atmosphere of the presidential election.\nNot six months have since passed, and it already feels like so long ago, likely due to the density of each day's events that followed. I've already written enough to refute these changes in my country, to feel that all I need to say here is able to be said by the music itself. I am, like many of you, exhausted, and it is not even halfway through the second month of the year.\nSo once again I return to this structure, this shelter I found in the woods of my own meandering imagination. A weathered stone doorway is all that remains of whatever larger building once stood in the forest, but it is enough. Enough for us to rest beneath it, blocking out some of the rain, perhaps to build a small fire and keep the approaching darkness at bay.\nThe world is moving on, whether we wish it to or not, but I want you to know that whenever you need to forget about it for a little while, I will still be here, excavating these ruins, making small camps in the unmapped expanses of this uncertain landscape. You are always welcome to stay a while, and I will always be happy for your presence.\n---\nAll 33 prior Sleepbuilding releases are FREE here:  campsite.bio/oscillog",

            "about": "\"A Table of Tides\" is the thirty-first Sleepbuilding release to be mastered and published. Originally broadcast overnight on 30th May 2023, it is an exploration of Noise Engineering's Versio module - an open source digital signal processing platform, with both officially designed and user-designed firmware variations which can be interchangeably installed as desired.\nIn the case of \"A Table of Tides,\" the module had been flashed with the user-designed Multi Versio firmware, which offers eight different modes of operation. The voice of this broadcast originated from the Spectra mode, which is a resonator tuned to play five different notes that are themselves determined by an analysis of the harmonic content of all incoming audio. For \"Tides,\" Spectra was given nothing but pink noise from a Behringer 150 noise generator. The timing of the resultant melodic translations was determined via the usual array of triggers in my modular system, which consists of multiple dividers (even-numbered and probabilistic) and Boolean gates.\nAs usual, all of this writing about the technical side of how the sound was shaped, and nothing written at all about the sound itself. The music that emanated from this patch brought to mind a large oceanic vista, uninterrupted by landscapes or other structures, only waves and wind and a gradient sky above it, the slow oscillation from low tide to high cycling back and forth forever.\nThe sea has factored into so much writing, music and visual matter in my work throughout my entire life, and no matter how often I return to the subject, it never feels tired or old - it feels ageless and ever-present, it feels the way I imagined early civilizations felt when they gazed out at this seemingly endless border around their world, so much older and deeper and wilder than they could fathom, and the sea became an entity, a deity perhaps, something with a voice, even if it said things no one would ever understand.\nSomewhere, in the gulf of distance between our understanding of the world, and the true nature of the sea, I feel there must be an acceptance, a respect given to this impossibly large thing that contains everything but the skies (although perhaps it contains even that), a debt of gratitude for even being alive to witness it.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "A Warm Wooden Hollow was originally released on a limited edition run at Infraction Records in 2008, and like nothing else I had released at that time, it went out of print within a month's time. I was satisfied to let AWWH rest after that, so that the people who supported the release could relish it like a piece of special jewelry that you only wear on formal occasions.\nThese days, AWWH has become a sort of mythical beast, rarely appearing in the wild, and prized by collectors in a way that few other Milieu records have been. I don't listen to it very often, and when I do, it makes me very sad, but I am content with that as it was designed from its very skeleton to be a sad album.\nExpanding on that a little: the previous album I released with Infraction - Beyond The Sea Lies The Stars - was a longform ambient affair built solely out of juxtaposed and heavily processed orchestral tape loops. Following that aesthetic and atmosphere, I began the recording phase for Wooden Hollow with a distinct goal - to once again carefully pluck small melodic phrases, strums and swells from orchestral vinyl I loved, but this time I would use these sounds as a seafloor to build an ocean on top of. They would simultaneously shape the composition that grew around the loops like a vine, and color it in ways non-looped instruments never really could.\nAnd so Wooden Hollow is an ambient album built with the bones of my favorite composers - Smetana, Delius, Satie, Stravinsky, Mussorgsky, Debussy - and presented as a personal walk through the psychedelic gardens of Milieu's estate eight years ago. The visual aesthetic of AWWH is unlike any other, thanks to Luke Hazard's iconic and powerful processed photography, and those images have been preserved and carried over here, for this reissue.\nRounding out the double-disc set of AWWH is the incredibly rare EP Smokebuilder's Woodshop, itself only made available on 50 3\" CD-Rs sent out with the first fifty orders of the CD from Infraction. Woodshop is a three-track, 24 minute microcosm of dusty sunbeams lazily coloring an old Russian man's quiet apartment in Brighton Beach - steeped in that special kind of disconnected sadness you can only experience when you lose someone you love.\nIn addition to this EP, the second disc of this reissue also contains a forty minute Coppice Halifax mix of the closing track on AWWH, Inside The Sun. When AWWH was originally being conceived and created in 2006, Coppice Halifax was blooming to life as a new project, and the 1983 sessions were concurrent with the AWWH recordings. Thus, it felt appropriate to revisit Inside The Sun, itself a lengthy ambient piece whose chords echo the deep CH epics of the time, such as Bronze or Soil, and provide a very \"classic Halifaxian\" treatment to the master tape. What you hear is a sound sculpture that has one foot in 2006 and one foot in 2015, and enough delay to make that trip several times over. An appropriate and immersive counterpoint to Wooden Hollow's Impressionistic ambience.\nSo I relinquish this surreal pile of tape, compression and sadness to you, the curious listeners. Long may you mine it for the jewels it is rumored to contain...",

            "about": "Upon returning to the original, raw cassette recordings for A Blanket Of Infinite Repetitions, laid to sun-baked tape in 2010 in South Carolina, the temptation to play with the material became too great to bear, and subsequently these extended ambient pieces were generated. Built using a convoluted process of both wearing down the original cassette sound until it is nearly unlistenably textured, then elongating it digitally to allow for these textural events to pull themselves apart in unique ways, the resultant recordings were further processed live via an FX chain of exponential reverb saturations and pitch shifts up/down two octaves. This process allowed for moments that may have otherwise been very small melodic transitions in the original pieces to become far more pronounced and overt, effectively building huge atmospheres from a very singular provenance. These pieces have been especially mastered at a lower volume level to allow for the listener's momentary environment to color the playback, although they will also work sufficiently with a nicer set of headphones.\nThe original recordings have been remastered (albeit more traditionally) and augmented with a 40-minute Coppice Halifax remix here:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-blanket-of-infinite-repetitions-expanded-remastered",
            "credits": "released April 21, 2017\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Processed & recorded at White Pillar Workshop, April 2017, using only the original cassette recordings for A Blanket Of Infinite Repetitions. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Milieu Music number MML121.",

            "about": "As Milieu reaches its 9th year as a project, what better way to celebrate but with a brand new record? Academy Stripes is Milieu's 36th full-length album of original material, and the first at Recycled Plastics. So what should you expect to hear? A colorful assortment of happy-sad melodies in about a dozen different flavors, cast like a sunbeam over energetic drum machine programming and funky bass that floats elegantly like sex in space. The trademark attributes of the Milieu sound are still there - lots of creative detuning, analog signal processing and a focus on psychedelics that should bring a smile to just about anyone. Carefree feel-good music is complemented by elements of dualities (or maybe even stripes) that are noticeable in both the music and the track titles. Right on time for the Summer, released on Brian's 30th birthday, and ready to lovingly caress large and small speakers everywhere.",
            "credits": "released May 17, 2013\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Botany Bay, 2011-2013. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Album design by Eric Adrian Lee. A knowing wink, secret handshake and friendly high-five to Richard on track #8. Thanks to Herc, Hastings, Japp and Lemon. This is Recycled Plastics number RP5.",

            "about": "\"The mural was always his landmark, a mental metric to measure other distances against, relative to how close they were to it. It was a mundane painting of an old steamboat on the river that ran beside it, perhaps historic at one time, but now just a sun-baked wall of eroded paint. It had become totemic, almost a natural part of the landscape, rather than something an artist would have once toiled over, and it comforted him. He ran his palm across the faded blue of the painted river water, once a deeper navy, now worn down to a nearly baby blue. The sun was here too, hiding within the wall, sleeping underneath the mural. He thought he'd like that - it seemed like a beautiful place to be still, and it had only taken him most of his life to appreciate the need for stillness, the concrete importance of doing nothing.\"",

            "about": "\"Each of us like you\nhas died once,\nhas passed through drift of wood-leaves,\ncracked and bent\nand tortured and unbent\nin the winter-frost,\nthe burnt into gold points,\nlighted afresh,\ncrisp amber, scales of gold-leaf,\ngold turned and re-welded\nin the sun;\neach of us like you\nhas died once,\neach of us has crossed an old wood-path\nand found the winter-leaves\nso golden in the sun-fire\nthat even the live wood-flowers\nwere dark.\"\n-H.D., excerpt from 'Adonis'\n---\n'Aeolian Yellow' is the 23rd Sleepbuilding broadcast to be published here for free, as all prior entries in that series have been. It totals about fourteen hours of runtime, exploring the Aeolian scale through the voice of the Buchla 258t dual-oscillator and the extensive signal-processing veins of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system.\nThe Ohioan Winter we're still in the midst of has seemed to, this time, be very mild, with only two significant snowfalls giving way to much more rain and sleet instead. As I type this now, it already feels like Spring is advancing fast upon us, much earlier than it should be, and for this reason I have chosen 'Aeolian Yellow' as the aural counterpart to what is certainly an uncharacteristic February in the midwest - full with the sensation that this warmth is some kind of artifice, or perhaps a side-effect of an unseen process that is changing the world. Sarcastically, I wonder aloud what that process might be?\nStill, we can only ever exist in the place and time we're thrust into - we do not get to ask or choose - and it follows that for my part in this, I prefer to focus on the things that I can choose, the areas of my life and the world around me that I can change. Sessions such as this one have drawn a continuous line through my time on this planet, expressing (if nothing else) my contentment in wanting to share the mechanisms that bring me joy and comfort.\n'Aeolian Yellow' reminds me, at times, of previous Milieu albums like 'Beyond the Sea/Stars' at Infraction, which emerged as far back as eighteen years ago now, perhaps illustrating how little my tastes have changed in the palette of sound I like to explore - or even more possible, how little my tastes are even able to change, beyond the momentary and topical.\nWhether it is one or the other - a fixed conclusion in my brain's design, or something more mutable, changed imperceptibly by factors I cannot determine - the result is still clearly the same. My work, as offered here, is \"always returning\" as Eno once said, always fulfilling the same role in my life, and this can only lead me to speculate that while I may be able to offer you the fruits of my creative process as a method of putting positive change into the world around me, this process is in and of itself somewhat unable to be changed, and I am not the originator or director of this process, but merely another part of it.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "Following the STELLAR DEBRIS album are two EPs of additional material from the same sessions, cultivated from final-glossing tracks started in 2010-2011 a decade later - STANFORD TAURUS was the first of the supplemental recordings, and this, AFTERLIFE BLUES, is the second.\nWhere AFTERLIFE differs slightly from TAURUS is the presence of three tracks that are alternative versions of tracks included on H IS FOR HOLOGRAM - the title track, \"Dustybootz\" and \"Almaz Iso-Tanks\" - while the other four tracks are entirely new compositions. The three mixes came about while I was going through the original archived recordings for HOLOGRAM, with intent to remaster them, so they were well-suited to being included in the STELLAR DEBRIS session, which was much more a case of transfiguring the past into something suitable and cogent in the present. In this way, the versions can be seen as updates on their decade-older counterparts.\nAltogether, AFTERLIFE BLUES offers a set of heavier dance music with distorted rhythms and unusually textured percussion and bass, intercut against beautiful deep ambient techno pieces - the latter including the fourth entry in the extrasolar Caladan Waveforms suite...could there still be others?\nWith AFTERLIFE BLUES now published alongside the ambient epilogue of ANDROMEDAN DELTAS, the entire cycle of H IS FOR HOLOGRAM's 10th anniversary celebration is over. Everything brought up to current standards and practices, here in the future, hopefully ready to weather another ten years. It only makes sense to assemble a special set collecting all seven entries, so if you're interested in acquiring all of the HOLOGRAM reissue materials and their adjacent new works in one go, please check out the STARCOM SEPTET package here: XXXX",

            "about": "Upon returning to my session recordings for Bell'n Dither, it became apparent that I'd laid the groundwork for an ambient companion piece, much in the same way I later did with Inland By Night - rearranging Pawleys Island songs, reducing them to just melodies and ambience. For whatever reasons that I can no longer remember, these six tracks sat unrendered/unrealized/unreleased until I stumbled over them looking for other materials. With a little effort and processing, they now appear as a supporting fourth act with the reissues of Bell'n Dither  (milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/belln-dither),  Sadhills  (milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/sadhills)  and Amtrax  (milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/amtrax-plus).\nMusically, these songs bear more resemblance to my Statuettes album for Lee Norris' Txt label in the UK - ornamental and pretty, but also isolated and melancholic. Obvious influences from Aphex Twin's SAW II, Cylob's Cylobian Sunset, Eno and Budd's The Pearl and probably even Philip Glass' organ works. As I finalized them, I felt as if each track was a magical wand that, when used to strike bells, would ring out these beautiful melodies of longing and nostalgic fantasy. They have been named as such, although eagle-eared Milieu listeners will likely be able to work out what each track is a version of.\nAmbell Suns is a unique ambient perspective on Bell'n Dither's often glitchy and programmed approach, and stands on its own as a beatless Milieu monument built for sleep and introspection.",

            "about": "Amber Petrol'r is the first of two singles for/from the full-length affair Shallow Earth, issued at Recycled Plastics on May 17th. Opening with detuned breaths of polysynth pad, the mood quickly establishes itself with a ballooned FM bassline over a DR-660 digital drum machine. Slices of pop radio vocal flit around the stereo field, coagulating into a funky fuzz (or is that a fuzzy funk?). From there, Milieu turns on the cruise control, while the glistening melodies seep out of the speakers and stain the floorboards of the car. This all feels so very familiar, doesn't it? Have we all been here before? A moment's hesitation...\"Wait a minute, wait a minute...\" before a slow realization dawns: \"We've met before, haven't we? It was at your house, don't you remember?\" At this instant, we're no longer riding in a car, but falling upward into a fireworks show, surrounded by smoke and neon and electric heat. We're vaporized into a billion fluorescent particles of light, scattered across the horizon line like a radioactive rainfall, surfing on purple clouds in a sleepy night sky.\nSupporting Amber on her debut single are two non-album b-side tracks from the Shallow Earth sessions, Nectar Mag and Alpine Valet.

            "about": "Originally issued discreetly as a bonus 3\" CD-R packaged with the sprawling 8xCD-R box of live-in-studio Milieu sets HOUSEWORKS, the two beatless pieces that comprised the HOME WORKS EP (Ambisthmus / Rainspasture) share more common ground with the Statuettes recordings than the acidic braindancing techno of the Milieu live performances. It's been a full year (to the month) since that box set came out, and now that the Autumn is upon us, I feel like it's an apt moment to give these recordings a proper release of their own, instead of the bonus disc footnote that they were relegated to earlier on.\nMusically, these are pieces that manifested during rehearsals for (or post-set cooldowns from) the sessions that were broadcast online and released in the HW catalog subset. They are intimate and quietly majestic swoons of analog synthesizers played back in a dark basement studio, lit only by the blinking LEDs of the mixing board and the many pieces of hardware surrounding it. In the time since I pulled them off the tapes and memory cards they were laid onto, I've found three additional recordings that grew out of other live broadcasts in very much the same way, using primarily an analog polysynth that I now no longer possess. With these augmentations, AMBISTHMUS transforms from an afterthought into something much more resembling an album, a concerted effort that I am enjoying today as much as I hope you will too, and an admirable companion piece to be issued alongside the expanded PHOSPHENE WEATHER as it celebrates a 10th anniversary reissue.",

            "about": "Upon leaving South Carolina and moving to Ohio late last year, I was sad about having to leave my Lowrey organ behind. Everything we were taking had to fit into one shipping container, and there simply wasn't any room for it. The organ has been a mainstay in my studio, appearing in some capacity on nearly every single album I've recorded since buying it in 2002. Longtime friend and collaborator David Tagg was going to try to drive out and pick it up, but he hasn't been able to swing it. At this moment, it's set to be left on the curb outside my old house, for either the county waste pickup or some curious passerby to pick up, free.\nSo, as I enjoy settling into my new White Pillar Workshop, things still only feel as if they are 90% complete without the organ here. I'll eventually replace it, of course, but I'll likely opt for a different model or something even more graduated than the Lowrey. Thrift shoppers can't be too choosy. This is why I felt it pertinent to craft a special sendoff to the old Lowrey, something to wave goodbye to an old reliable friend with. The result of this initiative is Ambitropic Bedroom Carnival.\nA 2-track long player, containing brother-sister mixes of the same piece, has been built using only sounds from my Lowrey, sampled and taped and backed up across the years of use. It also features some field recordings of a windy spring day outside my first Columbian studio, 114RKD, which is visible in the Holga photograph used on the cover. The first piece is for the late nights that turned into mornings in that space, and the second is for the evenings that turned into late nights. A warm missive for something that's been such a vital part of my exploration as a musician.",

            "about": "Milieu has had a busy year, with regard to issuing \"pop\" albums of melodic composition and rhythmic reliability - Blurry Thursday, Thalline Dress, Stellar Debris and the Fan Club exclusive High In The Middle all see me in ultra-stimming mode, programming all kinds of details in my little square-pushing drum machines and coaxing all manner of color-tonality overload from a varied synthesizer collection and a 1.5-year old modular system that seems to be finally able to pull itself up on furniture and occasionally say \"Daddy.\"\nSo then, it should come as no surprise at all that I've still not yet exhausted myself on this pop-music funtime trip I seem to be on, and I have a new single packed tight with the good stuff, ready to be vaporized in celebration of the arrival of Autumn. '21 has been a shit year for the most part, just like '20, and perhaps this is what has compelled me toward both hyper-melodic and stimulation-seeking ends (as well as further into the deep end of meditation and disconnection via Vibratelepathos and Workingman's Drone sessions) - it's not possible to be sure, but in lieu of certainty and self-assurance, I am happy to offer up yet another slice of self-deprecating bedroom techno for you to peruse, hopefully subtracting you from our miserable worldly situations just that little bit more...\nAMBROX ORANGE feels like it could have been included on Thalline Dress or Stellar Debris or High In The Middle, and perhaps for that reason, it's better to put it out alone...or nearly alone. It's a psychedelic wide-lens barnburner that isn't quite acid or jungle or glitched out braindance, but somewhere between all of those things like a piece of sun-dried bubblegum in the sidewalk. It also brings me back to moments on Academy Stripes and Polypsilon, which is nice because it means there's a lot going on in only seven minutes. I've been lucky to come into five (!!!) chopped and screwed and totally BLUNTED remixes made lovingly by BLACK WICK (aka the owner of the illustrious Illuminated Paths tape label that issued Daughter and the remastered Dusty Box, among other things - he is also half of Poolside Rail Bus with me, for those wondering). Needing some sequential glue, as I often do, I dug out a couple outtakes from various sessions this Summer and last and included them here - ETHER CYMBAL, a tropical wonk interlude from a livestream session, and DUSK TREADER, a reduced version of the lesser-known b-side BORIS & HIS BEDROOM BEAT.\nAll eight tracks coalesce to form a unique and slightly spooky experience, music for trick-or-treating in Milieu-Land if you like. I'm calling AMBROX a single, but in truth you're getting almost 40 minutes of jams. Special thanks are due to Black Wick for his talents and time, and Sophia for helping out with titles and putting up with me getting stoned and playing back tracks over and over again to get my mixing notes straight. Extra special ORANGE thanks to Ross - without his Juno 106-shaped contribution to the Workshop, this recording could not exist.",

Here, almost eight years later, I've returned to the source recordings, tapes and software files for the occasion of reissuing Bell'n Dither, and expanded Amtrax to a robust 15 track album all its own.\nThe original five mixes of Afterschool Trak, Amtrac, Archeocyathid, Golden Hill and The Light In The Lake appear here, re-sequenced and granted their original mix headings as well. Beyond these, the original version of Afterschool Trak (from the Pinwheel Carousels compilation) appears here, as well as Star Bath, an EP cut from 2005 that has only managed to surface on scarce physical iterations until now. Further rounding out the substance of the album are a number of Bell'n Dither outtakes, many of which feel more loose and \"jammy\", despite their intricately programmed rhythms and analog melodic textures. For this reason, they were likely omitted from both the Sadhills companion album and Amtrax, only now surfacing to greet curious ears.\nListening back to these tracks today, it becomes more than apparent how much of a love affair with my Korg ER-1 drum machine this album was. The ER-1 appears on every single cut, often in multiple juxtapositions, providing not only rhythm but tonal parts and other textures that are likely to be recognized as skeletal forms within other Bell'n Dither tracks. An interesting tableaux of works that makes for a stimulating excursion alongside Bell'n Dither and Sadhills, and a proper issuing of many of these oft overlooked cuts.",

            "about": "Analogg Breakfasts is not the new Milieu album, but it is a new Milieu album. A nice sizzling audio fry-up. Everything live on hardware, fumbled over with sleepy hands, one take, no overdubs, \"warts and all\" as they say. A set of simple and fun electronic tracks for the sheer enjoyment of the act. Perhaps, on some deeper level, this is the Milieu equivalent to something like Coppice Halifax's Bedroom Carpet? It's certainly just as informal and not-produced. So there you have it...Moogs were sufficiently Moogy, Penny was sufficiently Penny and happy times were had by all. Time to go to bed, because I'm going to see Autechre tomorrow!",
            "credits": "released October 8, 2015\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Botany Bay, Spring-Autumn 2015. Vaguely mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Milieu Music number MMD029. All part of a balanced breakfast.",

            "about": "Asleep at the dashboard, in an egg-shaped chair, with a paperback of Clarke short stories leaning against a uniformed knee, you're jostled awake by the sound of a sputtering signal coming through the radio. Drifting for months between systems, you've become all too comfortable with the silence of the surrounding void, almost forgetting what the radio even sounded like.\nYou hurriedly put your fingers to the receiver, instinctively nudging the orange Bakelite dials to slowly guide the blue meter into a more greenish frequency band - muscle memory returns, and it's just like all those seemingly endless nights at the academy, manning the port station as a glorified air-traffic controller, logging merchant vessel after merchant vessel, with the occasional barge bearing a higher clearance than you were permitted to discuss, all the while feeling a grandiose boredom, wondering when, if ever, you'd be able to leave on one of those outgoing ships, and see if the stars somewhere else were any more interesting than the one you were stuck orbiting.\nThat was a long time ago, though, and you find it more than funny now to consider it in a nostalgic way - memory is a truly malleable thing, as fickle as the past may be. By now, the signal is coming in strong, with little edges of noise brushing up against the insides of the amplifier. You'd ping it for an ident, if you even knew what it was, but this sound pouring out of the dash cones was completely foreign. It began as something more static, but the more you listen to it, the more you are able to perceive details, tonal shifts, little hills and valleys of what sounds like music, if you were being honest. A steadily approaching cosm of oboes and clarinets, woodwinds that could be neither wood nor wind, a surrealistic orchestra coming from nowhere.\nYou glance at the positioning of the signal's origin, and feel oddly unsurprised to find that the ship has detected absolutely nothing. Just the same unwavering needle on the sheet that you've been nodding off to for the last six months. The oscilloscope is full of life, however, proving to you that what you're hearing is not just in your own mind.\nStruck with an idea, you quickly pivot around the U-shaped console and open the manual system. The latches come loose with a little extra prying, having stayed inert and unused for a very long time. The stick and levers inside the box are pristine, but somehow the smell of dust still pervades. You activate the control top, flicking three sequential red switches on the underside of the panel, and the blue backlights illuminate the handles and buttons, letting you know the reins have now been passed to your hands. You grasp them hesitantly, carefully, considering every gentle pause and minute push as having a massive effect on the ship's steering. A slight whirring sound from a few decks away tells you the engines are responding properly to even your slight alterations.\nIt's just as you thought - the moment the ship alters course, the radio signal begins to fade again. You'll have to make careful adjustments by hand in order to follow it, and hopefully, this will lead you to wherever, or whatever, it may be. After a few tries around the compass, you manage to arc the ship slightly more northwest from its original heading, and the sounds shimmer in a beautiful harmonic unison, as if smiling, welcoming you to some new land.\nAfter about twenty minutes of the course remaining stable with the sustained radio reception, you lock the coordinates in and return the ship to cruise control. Walking across the cabin to the viewscreen, you look at where the ship's been pointed for the first time, and you finally see it - a slowly swelling orb of white light. A different type of light, not like other stars...this light seems to be thicker, perhaps with something moving beneath its surface, like a swirling sphere made of intensely bright fog.\nWhen you found this ship, months ago, docked with a dead captain inside, and decided to take his ident for your own and finally leave the station, you had no idea of what you might find, only a vague set of possible destinations and enough fuel to take you to all of them and then some. You never in your wildest dreams thought you'd stumble into something so...alien, profound, perfect.\nThe growing curtain of white slowly blankets the entire cabin, and the sound, oh what a sound it is, pealing through the ship's intercoms like the horns of angels, announcing your ascent into heaven. \"Heaven,\" you say it out loud, and then softly chuckle. Even paradise is simply called home by those lucky enough to find it.",

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe first set, cryptically titled ANDROPHOTIC NURSE MASK, was completely improvised and broadcast online as audio/video from the White Pillar Workshop studio, privately to the Milieu Music Fan Club. It was created using only four Korg Volca units (Keys, Bass, Beats and Sample), in conjunction with outboard FX like an Alesis Quadraverb, a Pioneer spring reverb box, a BBE analog delay and a Boss RV-3 digital reverb, all channeled through the able faders and paths of a Peavey FX2x24 mixing desk. The choice was made to index different tracks throughout the different phases of the set, in order to make it easier to navigate, although playback should still remain as seamless as it was when it was performed.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",

            "about": "Time is just a wind blowing through, pushing the past behind you. All the moments you ever remember are interred, unreachable, with every other moment you've forgotten, building up across years like sand on a beach. Sand that fills the belly of a hungry hourglass, succumbing to gravity, inevitable and finite. You gaze through the glass, and sometimes, you can see things - artifacts and debris, pulled ever downward into that mindless quicksand. Remembrance, romance, reflection, cast onto time's windswept dunes, themselves once majestic mountains and stone temples, where the song of memory could be heard blowing through the air, ageless wind swaying the green leaves on the trees, now forever asleep and returned to that still Earth.\nThis recording would appeal to devotees of albums such as Beyond The Sea Lies The Stars, Leaves Painted Purple, Phosphene Weather and Thriambus.",

            "about": "\"Let us welcome the season, and taste of that bliss, which the sun-shine and daylight forbids.\"\n-Thomas Brerewood, excerpt from 'Autumn' (1770)\n---\n'April's Blissed Communion' is the sixteenth Sleepbuilding session to mastered and published. It was broadcast on the evening of April 24, 2023 using the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, primarily focusing on two granular samplers that were being fed the signal from Wildfire Laboratories' Yanqui oscillator - a fixed-frequency 389 hertz CMOS oscillator with no controls whatsoever - as both samplers were then directed to relay this audio information back in the Dorian scale.\nA much more 'modest' length of session, 'April's Blissed Communion' offers an accessible return to the Sleepbuilding series after taking a month off, in order to complete recording work for 'Watch the Head.' Although it was recorded in April, as rainstorms coated the green valley with the yearly promise of new life, the textural personality of this session felt apt for the onset of Autumn as well, now creeping in very slowly and subtly this year. Sometimes, there is enough cool air and wind compelling it over the Far Hills, that if you were to close your eyes, Spring and Autumn in Ohio would feel interchangeable. Having spent 33 long and sweltering years in the green Hell of the deep south, I am always in awe of the abundant beauty of where I now reside. It is my sincere hope that this soft-focus synthesizer pastorale also accompanies you, wherever you are, in a gentle and pleasant way. '23 has been a long and chaotic year, and now, it is finally ending.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Originally issued only as a digital download, given as gracious thanks to patrons who donated toward the costs of retrieving data from a failed studio hard drive. Thankfully, with my studio back in working order, Auf / On can enjoy some time in the sunlight. I've put together a limited edition CD-R version of this, for all the collectors and people who may not have had the chance to get this album the first time, and it has been appropriately designed to fit alongside Quebrith & Yarrow, a similar album that was also previously only available for a charity.\nAuf / On was recorded live using only the following hardware: Korg ER-1/ES-1/Volca Bass/Beats/Keys, Boss DR-660/880, Roland SH-32/TR-505, Moog MF-101/102, Alesis Quadraverb, Mackie ProFX8, Pioneer SR-202W and a Tascam DR-07.",

            "about": "Long since separated and meant to be companion pieces from the start, Aurora Borealis and Night Currents were two albums whose sessions ran back to back. Borealis was given to U-Cover in Belgium, in 2005, to release as a physical format introduction to Milieu. As such, it contains tracks that previously appeared on Slow Lid Close and Songs We Found In The Sand (a couple of which are alternate mixes) alongside tracks that were recorded specifically for it (although Narthex, Statuettes and Inline Track were all recorded much earlier than that in 2004).\nPretty much right after Borealis was issued, I started work on Night Currents, and the two albums segue together almost perfectly, with Borealis ending on the ambient meditation of Hidden Paths, and Currents starting with the elaborate opener Journey By Heliodrome, which washes over as pure ambient for the first two minutes or so. Stylistically, Currents gets darker than Borealis, which sounds very sunny for the most part, and this was always intended as a daytime/nighttime counterpoint.\nUntil now, both albums were given simple CD-R reissues in stamped white paper sleeves, following the U-Cover versions going out of print, and I've always wanted to see them justified as a 2CD release with renewed album art and stylish presentation. This reissue is as close to my original intent as I think I can get, and it's appropriate that it's happening on the tenth anniversary of the Milieu name. The music here is playful, exploratory, naive and uninhibited, but I think it still works well as both an early introduction to my work and a summer listening experience.",

            "about": "\"... the pure clear song of that meadowlark perch’d on a fence-stake, with glad notes of daybreak, two or three liquid-simple notes, repeated at intervals, full of careless happiness and hope.\nFresh and rosy red the sun is mounting high, The flashing sun bursts through in unlooked-for directions, silently mounts in the broad clear sky.\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from 'Morning'\n---\n\"Auroral Pageant\" is the 35th Sleepbuilding broadcast to be mastered and published for free. It runs for just over fourteen hours, and was originally streamed live overnight at YouTube on 6th March 2024 - a year ago, almost to the day. It consists of two Doepfer A-188 feedback units exploring two different (though very similar) scales in two different keys - one plays Mixolydian in F sharp, the other plays Dorian in B.\n\"Pageant\" is somewhat unremarkable in its topicality - it is a pleasant and operatively endless landscape of peaks and valleys, one that I have likely visited and logged before, but given the tumultuous nature of the landscape around me, outside of my studio, I feel that now is the time for familiarity and validation. My music has performed many different roles, both utilitarian and aesthetic, throughout the last twenty years, for me and for you, but sometimes it is necessary to not move the needle with each peak of a waveform, but instead soften the momentary uncertainties with predictable comfort.\nIn this way, \"Auroral Pageant\" is closer to what brilliant minds like JS Bach may have described as \"absolute music\" - that is to say, music without a subject, simply written for the joy of having done so. This wouldn't be entirely true, as I most definitely had a subject in mind while patching it - easy to guess - but again, returning to a source as fundamental and omnipresent as the sun for compositional direction doesn't contradict my feeling that this is meant to merely be more of what I've already done many times over in the past, albeit in a gracious and joyful way.\nThe idea of the novel being superior to the perennial is something that is perhaps deceptive - no doubt an idea that has been reinforced throughout our lives by capitalism, even if and when it may ring incidentally true - and I feel that thinking only seeks to further distance us from the recognition of our deeper and \"truer\" selves, not as humans in the intelligent design sense, but as biological organisms who enjoy vibrations, temperatures and other stimulating physical and chemical sensations over and over again for no other reason besides that they make sense to some distant and primordial part of our brains and bodies.\nI often wonder about this, about how full-circle certain things seem to become, when centuries of compositional and artistic progress become simple colored shapes and textures like Rothko, Mondrian, Pollock, echoing more of the natural world than they do not, or JS Bach's ornate arrangements eventually give way to Autechre and Merzbow, themselves closer in feel and shape to a crackling fire or a rushing river. These observations hopefully reinforce my notion that we have, whether we are consciously aware of it or not, sought out the same sensory experiences over and over, and with that in mind, here is another pleasant dream of the sun that you and I have had a thousand times over, offered to you at a time when too many things around us are no longer the same has they have been.\n---\nALL 35 SLEEPBUILDING RELEASES ARE FREE HERE:  campsite.bio/oscillog",

            "about": "\"After the dazzle of day is gone,\nOnly the dark, dark night shows to my eyes the stars;\nAfter the clangor of organ majestic, or chorus, or perfect band,\nSilent, athwart my soul, moves the symphony true.\"\n-Walt Whitman, \"After the Dazzle of Day\"\n'Beams of the Declining Sun' is the twelfth published recording in the open-ended Sleepbuilding catalog of generative ambient music, culled from overnight broadcasts on YouTube with the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, Open Broadcaster Software and two budget webcams. This piece runs for nine and one-half hours, and was created using the voice of the 'CSAW' sawtooth synthesizer mode in Mutable Instruments Braids (modeled after the Yamaha CS-80 from 1977) to play the Ionian scale, with a complex array of probabilistic/subdivided triggers for timing and a Turing machine-based sequencer. It was originally broadcast on April 25th, 2023.\nMusically, the piece feels empty - not in a necessarily sparse or minimalistic sense (although it is still very much both of those things), but in a pastoral sense - like a landscape open in all directions, stretching beyond the vanishing point, composed of unoccupied space. Ground, distance and sky, lit by the remnants of a sun that has already sunk beneath the horizon. It is beautiful and also debilitating in its loneliness, the fullest embodiment of being truly lost and disconnected, an ocean of terrestrial space.\nFollowing my previous consultation with the I Ching for suggestions on where to go, what to do, with 'Burned Oath,' it felt pertinent to once again ask the void for a direction. This time, the I Ching impressed upon me two clear ideas: Reduction of speed when I am able to detect a positive situation, and subsequently making progress through a dangerous situation without fear that something bad will happen to me. As with any aspects of the I Ching, there are many ways to interpret the poems, and apply them, but in this case, I feel that the key notion at play here is the sense that I am able to carry the warmth of happiness with me through the darker lands of uncertainty, that the work I'm doing to offer something constructive to the world can insulate me when the doom closes in again.\nSo I find myself weary at the end of long days of work, which as of late have been filled with brain-scrambling compositional chiseling and pedantic programming for what will eventually be my next significantly composed work. It is comforting for many different reasons to have these extended seas of pleasant emptiness within arm's reach, to slip into and slow down beside. The open landscape is not really so lonely after a while, only still and quiet, and it's reassuring to know that when I am fed up with wracking my brain over a microbial detail in a song that only I will notice has changed, this painterly plain of ego erasure is never too far away.\n----\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Almost eight years later, after Bell'n Dither was issued on only 100 copies and swiftly went out of print, it finally re-emerges in a proper reissue! Repackaged with an updated cover design with a matte cover sticker printed by David Tagg, in an edition that matches the three companion releases Sadhills  (milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/sadhills),  Amtrax Plus  (milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/amtrax-plus)  and the previously unreleased Ambell Suns  (milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/ambell-suns).\n\"Needing something soft, moody and bittersweet for those humid Summer nights on the way? Look no further. Bell'n Dither is a spiritual follow-up to 2006's dusky electronic effort Night Currents, and probably the most electronic Milieu album yet. Dither is overloaded with skittering, microscopically manipulated beats and spacious pools of warm chords. Droplets of sad, rainy melodies cover a hulking rusted sub-bass contraption while you roll the windows down in your car just so you can smell the air before a thunderstorm. Dither could be considered both a return to form as well as exploratory and new for Milieu, and should satisfy even the most discriminating of Milieu listeners.

            "about": "Bent Appletrees first appeared as a volume of unreleased Milieu tracks in 2006, at the Decisive Sound netlabel. Over time, five more volumes of outtakes, alternate versions, live tracks and other ephemera from various recording sessions surfaced, filling out a series of releases that were intended to be as informal as possible. Owing nods to the bootleg collecting, discography checking, record shop hunting days of my youth (who am I kidding, those days aren't over by a long shot) and to patchwork releases like Ovuca's Onclements and Odd Nosdam tapes, Bent Appletrees is an almost diary-like catalogue of interesting jewels collected and retrieved from years and years of recording work. Many tracks are just loops, while others are more fleshed out demos of things that would later be finished and properly released. There are also fully finished tracks that, for one reason or a million, never made it anywhere. After much archival work, plugging in old hard drives, going through old tapes and CD-Rs, scrubbing FTP directories, I think I've mostly brought Bent Appletrees up to a respectable speed today. This collection, Bent Applefarm, compiles every track from volumes 1-6 of Bent Appletrees and 28 more previously unreleased tracks from various sessions (these being referred to as Bent Appleleaves). There will probably be more collections of Appletracks in the future, as time goes on, but for now, this set should serve to both satisfy the eager listener and Milieu collector, and establish the current canon of Bent Appletrees material in a nice solid physical print run. So, here's 99 Milieu orphans, and here's to 99 more...",

            "about": "In October of 2015, I released an exhaustive completionist set called Bent Applefarm, which collected all six volumes of the Bent Appletrees series and one new volume - Bent Appleleaves. The set is comprised of outtakes, unreleased and alternate versions, live tracks and demos, and Appleleaves was a nice tableaux of extras to include in the collection. Since then, I've received several requests for a standalone Appleleaves release, for the collectors who already own Appletrees I-VI, which only makes sense. So, here's a single-disc microverse of Milieu outtakes and unreleased tracks that do not appear elsewhere!",

            "about": "Bent Appletape was an album that was recorded in 2005-2006 and ultimately shelved in favor of things like Our Blue Rainbow and New Drugs. Considering that it was recorded during the same time as the aforementioned two albums, it is easy to hear resemblance to many other Milieu tracks on this album. Two versions of \"Kontour\" appear, while two other versions would appear on the first Bent Appletrees album. \"Applejack Beats\" contains the inclusion of jazz and funk drum breaks - a staple of the New Drugs sound that came afterward. \"Sleepy Route\" contains very obvious melodic elements that later appeared in ambient form on \"The Sleeping Earth\", a track recorded for the Grassland Melodies split with Quosp. \"Nite Lite\" contains the fuzz bass that was present on In Hills Made Of Clouds and Pillowtone Poems. \"Powerliner\" is led by loops of guitar feedback, something that I would not fully explore until a year later working on Three Space Songs. \"Wood Weed\" is only one version of a track that was given about a dozen different versions, never to be included on anything. \"Pillbox Piano\" was the first track recorded for The Tandem Series 5 split at Boltfish, but was never used for reasons unknown. \"Schoolbus Beats\" could even be seen as a predecessor to \"Alvin Sparks\", using the same synths. Overall, Bent Appletape is an interesting artifact from a time that has totally passed within my work. I could not hope to make an album that sounds like this now, even if I tried. Like some distilled alcohol that matures over time, I have cultivated a fondness for the playfulness and naivete in these songs since they were initially created. Hopefully you enjoy them too.",

Originally released as a free 192 KBPS download at Decisive Sound in 2006, this is the first time this material has been made available in a high-quality/lossless digital format. Musically it could be considered a distant relative to 2010's Bell'n Dither album, with several tracks focusing on detailed drum programming and playful bittersweet melodies.",

Containing forgotten tracks from 2004-2008, these records are chock full of outtakes, demos, live and alternate versions. For those of you wanting more stuff from the earlier Milieu days (Night Currents, Our Blue Rainbow) these two volumes are ripe with material from those sessions especially. Tracks like \"Treebark Honey\" and \"Red Balloons Over A Blue Shore\" are real gems that I'm almost mad at myself for leaving off of proper albums!",

            "about": "Available now for download in the digital shop are the fifth and sixth installments to the ever-eclectic Bent Appletrees series. Containing forgotten tracks from 2004-2008, these records are chock full of outtakes, demos, live and alternate versions. For those of you wanting more stuff from the earlier Milieu days (Night Currents, Our Blue Rainbow) these two volumes are ripe with material from those sessions especially. Tracks like \"Treebark Honey\" and \"Red Balloons Over A Blue Shore\" are real gems that I'm almost mad at myself for leaving off of proper albums!",

            "about": "On May 7th, 2023 I unexpectedly recorded something very pretty with my modular system, troubleshooting a couple modules after a power blip and testing their fidelity after a full day without being powered on. I plugged up a very simple patch with the Buchla 258t dual-oscillator, playing a Mixolydian scale with timing information coming from a Turing machine, into two granular processors and a tapped delay. The resultant recording felt both active and still in beautiful ways, and after a little post-processing and overdubbing an uneventful field recording from my basement window in June of 2018, Beside a Green Window was complete.\nI'm issuing this recording for free on the occasion of my fortieth year on this planet, wanting nothing more from it than a simple relaxing pastorale to accompany a pleasantly empty day of reflection and time with my family. Whatever meaning you find within it, or place upon it, is complete and correct. I seem to forever find myself beside one green window or another, pondering and patching and playfully exploring things while the sun goes up and comes back down again, day after day. This is a sunny day like any other, notable only because I can look back to 5:45 PM exactly forty years ago, and look no further, and this recording is something for me to mark that passage of time with.\nI hope to be here a while longer to share things like this with you, wherever and whenever you are when you discover them. It goes without saying, but I'll say it all the same, that I am very proud to know my work has brought any sizeable peace or distraction to anyone besides myself - that I am content to be a part of it myself, just as you are, and to know that in the crystallized moment, frozen in the perpetual now of these recordings, we're able to be together, and I can say the things I want to say without speaking to you at all, and you can understand them too. Thank you for reading all of my verbose meandering, listening to and experiencing these wordless clouds of vibration with me. It means more than you think.",

            "about": "Originally issued on a CD edition of 505 copies at Infraction Records in 2006, and now available for the first time in a lossless digital format. BTSLTS was a nearly accidental album in the making, with recording sessions taking place during a two-day stretch of consumption and sleep deprivation. Largely a loosely planned conceptual experiment, BTSLTS utilized a unique system of creating entire tracks from single tape loops of carefully sampled orchestral vinyl, juxtaposing them in dozens of different ways to create flowing and hypnotic compositions. Due to the large amount of tape hiss layered onto the mix with each subsequent iteration of the loops, the music adopted a nautical atmosphere similar to the washed out sounds one might hear while floating out at sea, completely disconnected from any landmass. This album is a landmark piece among the Milieu oeuvre, representing a first step into the textural ambient works that the Milieu name would come to be associated with today, and enduring the test of passing time as a recording that seems to come from no era, no actual space, with no author. It simply seems to exist.",

            "about": "After the Parallax album Blisschord was completed in May 2004, and the Milieu project began to fully take form, the original idea of Blisschord was most definitely still very present in my mind. Through the years, I've revisited the idea, first on the Three Space Songs EP in 2007, then again on the Broken Pieces compilation at Gravity Halo in 2010. Once more I've gone back to the concept for a liveset I performed in March, 2011. All three variations have been assembled here, and I think they make for a fascinating companion piece to the Blisschord album.\n-Brian, May 2011",

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe third volume, BLOODY KNUCKLES BETAPHASE, consists of two different live sets and a rehearsal track between them. The first of the two sets, Lastgasp Dusk Returner, was drafted as an \"encore\" performance for someone who missed the live stream of Sine Wand Honeydowsing. It bears some similarities in patterns and melodic sequences, but is an altogether more frantic and technoid entity, building up through patches of off-kilter breaks and bent acid lines to a barnstorming kickdrum fantasy at the end. The intermission cut, TEST ACID, is a recording of the first ever video broadcast from the White Pillar Workshop, created to ascertain and calibrate volume levels and distortion thresholds. The second set, the titular Bloody Knuckles Betaphase, was a proof-of-concept set made on the bedroom carpet, with a smaller Mackie mixer (instead of the usual Peavey mammoth) and a suitcase-rig of MIDI-free mostly analog instruments. It goes from an uptempo Analord-style approach to an industro dub lurch, with rugged distorted drum machines, shuddering glitch sequences and metallic pad chords, which tightens back up by the end and lays down the law with gigantic planetary collapse rhythmic fervor.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",
            "credits": "released March 13, 2018\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Improvised and recorded live at White Pillar Workshop on November 4th, 2017 (#1-6), November 2nd, 2017 (#7) and January 10, 2018 (#8-12). #1-7 created using Korg Volca Beats/Bass/Keys/Sample, with outboard FX and a Peavey FX2x24 mixing desk. #8-12 created using a Boss DR-110, 4x Korg Volcas and Bliptronic 5000, with Ibanez SM7 / Boss RV-3 / Synthrotek PT2399 FX and a Mackie ProFX8 mixer.

            "about": "BLURRY THURSDAY is the affectionate title given to three new Milieu pieces, developed in tandem between a hardware setup of analog synths and drum machines, a couple different FM synth boxes and a DAW with more overdubs, sampling and FM synths to round everything off. The result exists contentedly in the post-SUN CAST landscape, with lots of melodic melancholy, funky bass riffs, 83 BPM drum grooves and slow-burn dynamism that lets you get comfortable for the ride.\nThe title track could be a sister recording for SUNDAY MEADOW BLUSH, as both recordings are whole-side-of-a-12\" affairs, and both revisit the very \"downtempo\" Milieu sound of the earlier albums. \"Housewares & Highlighters\" picks the pace back up again with a breezy house feeling, slipping in hints of my influences from DJ Sprinkles, early Metamatics and Kerrier District, coalescing with some distinctly New Wave bass work and some acidic subtleties for added bounce. Closing the album's second side is \"Terpentine Xylophone\", the first piece I've recorded with the Yamaha TX81Z, which drapes a cloak of quiet contemplation over the last eight minutes, recalling music from prior recordings like IMPROVISATIONS FOR HYLIAN PIANO & WOODWINDS, ELIDE and some of the VIBRATELEPATHIC ANTIVIRAL BROADCASTS.\nAltogether, BLURRY THURSDAY represents a \"best foot forward\" contribution from Milieu, with the optimism of a new year in mind, being the first recording of its kind to appear in 2021 so far. As you can plainly hear, Milieu is alive and well beneath all that Ohioan ice and snow, and as Spring and Summer approach, with their green revivals, you'll be hearing from him more and more.",

            "about": "Originally issued in April 2009, Brittle Paper Cathedrals has remained a somewhat under-the-radar Milieu album. In many ways, it was drafted as a kind of travelogue, to illustrate the different pastoral fields, oceanside stretches and sad dusky evenings that Milieu was host to across a span of five years.\nLooking back at it now, it is easy to imagine parts of this album comfortably appearing on other albums. The four-part Rural Dialogues suite could have been included on the countryside eclogue Silver Horns Heard Over Green Hills, with its warped guitar source material and filter-passed texture beds. The first of the two Imagined Histories pieces recalls striking similarities to the Nine Billion Names album, full of delayed organ feedback trails and pedal bass hum, while the second part feels right in between the first two Ocean Lion albums and Phosphene Weather, burbling restrained chords and melodies over a slow two-note bass motif. Finally, the closing two-track suite of Sand Dunes immediately conjures up reference points of Brother's endless sad refrains and the nautically blissed out Beyond The Sea/Stars recordings for Infraction Records three years before.\nPerhaps this is why the album has gone out of print and unattended for over nine years now - that it always felt so fractured between these crystalline sonic identities, that it never really belonged to itself. The title, whose original meaning has been lost to me now, seems to outline this fragility, and emphasize the macrocosmic grandeur found within barely held together aural ecosystems. Truly, remastering this material was a challenge, as much of it was generated using very low-fidelity equipment and recording processes, and the entirety of the album's voice resides within a very narrow set of frequency bands, where even the slightest equalizer nudge can offset the temperature of the atmosphere a whole lot. I can, however, report that I am happier now with the sound of these pieces than I was when I released them.\nTo support this reissue edition, I've also included the out of print Dialogue Five EP, which was an outtake from the Rural Dialogues session, as well as a sixth Rural Dialogues session cut, omitted for some reason at the time. Perhaps inevitably, I have also spent considerable time drafting a Coppice Halifax excavation of the original Sand Dunes session, which runs just over forty minutes long and provides a modern counterpoint to the album proper. Also updated is the album's artwork - which was previously a simple wallpaper pattern I reproduced - now a black and white photograph from the ravine behind my current studio.",

            "about": "Brother is a double-album that took years for me to complete. Recording work began in 2004 after the concept was drafted, and the album wasn't released in full until 2007 when it was finished. An abridged 10-track version, featuring the songs in a different, much cleaner mix, was released at Metanoia Media in 2005 while the remainder of the material was completed. Brother was limited to only 50 copies of 2xCD-R sets in 2007, and went out of print almost immediately. I've been somewhat open about my lack of faith in the album as the years pass - I don't feel that the sound of it has dated all that well, although I do stand behind many of the pieces from a compositional standpoint. Several of my friends and fans have continually praised this album, so I feel that my disconnection from it must be a more personal one. It was conceptualized as a sort of abstracted offering to my would-be brother - an idea I'd been unable to shake since my mother miscarried in the mid-1980s. Hopefully, the concept provides just the right amount of context for what is ultimately a deep and dark and very brooding ambient album. The sadness is caked on in layer after layer of purple reverb and grey tape hiss, and is finally presented here for the first time since the limited 2007 release.\n\"This album is a solid, and significant achievement in the world of ambient. Each piece is well thought out, carefully constructed, and deeply moving; much like the works of Brian Eno or Tangerine Dream, it is intelligent and mature. Milieu's prolific nature might lead some to believe the quality of his work suffers, but when the kind of time and dedication calls out to him to create works of this intensity, the results are stunning.\"\n-Luke Hazard, 2005",

            "about": "\"Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,\nNo birth, identity, form - no object of the world.\nNor life, nor force, nor any visible thing;\nAppearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain.\nAmple are time and space - ample the fields of Nature.\nThe body, sluggish, aged, cold - the embers left from earlier fires,\nThe light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again;\nThe sun now low in the west\nrises for mornings and for noons continual;\nTo frozen clods ever the spring's invisible law returns,\nWith grass and flowers and summer fruits and corn.\"\n-Walt Whitman, \"Continuities\"\n'Burned Oath' is the eleventh overnight Broadcast to be mastered and released, selected from a steadily growing archive of Sleepbuilding sessions. It was generated by the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, using the voice of a 2HP Pluck Karplus-Strong paraphonic digital synthesizer playing the Locrian scale. It was originally broadcast on April 7th, 2023, following the listening party event celebrating the release of 'Ocean Lion IV' by Coppice Halifax. Owing to this earlier starting time, 'Burned Oath' runs even longer than the twelve-hour runtime that has come to be (more or less) the working standard for the Sleepbuilding releases.\nMusically, this session exists somewhere between very formative Milieu recordings such as 'Beyond the Sea Lies the Stars' (which was semi-generative) and elements of the 'Sun-Day' series, evoking a sepia-tinted remembrance of a shoreline, a sea breeze, forestial islands scattered across a purple-orange horizon, held just above the surface as they allude to ruins and shipwrecks beneath the waves. A drowsy orange sun hovers overhead, warming the air into a blanket that compels us downward and reclining upon the soft sand, blinded in the radiance, until the starry firmament unfurls, inverting everything.\nConsidering how many sessions have already come to pass in this fashion, I've begun to play with how I even approach this now well-developed process, from selecting which broadcast to publish next, aligning it with a Kupka painting and a passage of poetry, and reassessing what the entire act even means to me. In order to arrive at 'Burned Oath' I decided to consult the void on the subject, and threw the I Ching, which I take quite seriously in the sense that I have no business asking the universe what it thinks if I am not willing to accept the answer. This is a wondrous method of deductive logic to use in the creative act, because if I realize that I am too afraid of getting an answer from the I Ching that I will not like, I have effectively determined what I desire the outcome to be, and have answered my own question.\nIn some situations, I prefer to embrace the chaos of this process, and so the I Ching suggested that I break with tradition a bit, and to not see anything before me as rigid or predetermined. It is for this reason I selected this broadcast, because it has been (to date) the only broadcast that came to pass without a given name, simply being labeled as \"Sleepbuilding\" in my haste of preparing the entire 'Ocean Lion IV' album, and its subsequent listening party and afterparty ambient patch all within two weeks. In mulling over what I could name this session for publication, I felt compelled to give the individual partitions of the work unique names, rather than labeling them all in deference to the overall session, but until the I Ching pointed out that this should be the way forward, I'd put it out of my mind as breaking with the format I'd come to enjoy with these broadcast releases.\nAnd so, like all aspects of the Sleepbuilding sessions that seem to derive their idiosyncrasies from a deep well of my decisions, inspirations, experiences and desires, the titles chosen here have been plucked from a novel that affected me quite profoundly - themselves the name of a fictional philosophical lecture given within the story - and offered without any further contexts, despite their quite pointed relationships with either my own personal life at this moment, or some aspect of the creative process and the tools used that would be uninteresting or irrelevant to just about anyone else.\nAs the Whitman passage explains - \"ample are time and space\" - the void contains everything, and in doing so, remembers it for us, and this is functionally mirrored in the generative music I've been so enamored with this year; a prolific configuration of nesting dolls that each illustrate a specific law of their own universe, cascading and reflecting their incommensurable paths over and under one another, until the tangle of electricity and decisiveness accumulates a critical mass, and is vaporized in a single suspended moment of bliss.\nSurely, somewhere within our universe, or any other, we can find the answers we are willing to accept, if we are bold enough to ask the questions. And, if we are not yet confident enough in our convictions to inquire, then we already know, and have already decided.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "On the evening of July 26, 2019, an online release party was organized for the Sunbather's Pharmacopeia Vol. 1 CD release at Touched UK, which began with DJ sets from Steve Brown (Combinations In Electronic Sound) and Brian Damage (yours truly, premiering the set that would later be released as 'Like A River To The C' at Illuminated Paths:  illuminatedpaths.bandcamp.com/album/morning-c  ) and finally a full playthrough of the Touched CD. Everyone in attendance was having such a fun time, myself included, that the sporadic decision was made to migrate the party from the Touched chatroom to my personal Twitch account, where I booted up all of my machines, turned my webcams on and jammed out a full-bodied live set of bedroom techno. This set was recorded and, until now, has not been issued publicly anywhere. It's been carefully mastered to make the absolute most of the wide sound spectrum inhabited by all of these machines, and feels appropriate for the very end of Summer time, as the cool evenings are slipping in while you're still warmly distracted by the orange rays of sunshine.\nMusically, Burnt Pharm Afterparty continues where things like my Housework series and Lenticular Carpet Surfboard left off - lots of squiggles of acid lines and wobbly lead melodies, bent LFOs and super warped envelopes, cresting like waves over thick analog basslines and funky drum computers. Along with the also recently unearthed Morning Acid recordings, Afterparty embodies all the peak time playfulness of Milieu with just hints and shades of the melancholy that sometimes fully defines the project.",

            "about": "Butcher Block Andromeda (graciously christened by Kirk Marrison of Kiln) represents a decade of Milieu music, from its inauguration in May of 2004 to its 10th anniversary celebration in May of 2014. Fifty tracks, carefully selected from dozens of albums, EPs, singles and compilations, lovingly remastered (and in some cases appended for time) to be presented here in this thorough and detailed \"beginner's guide\". Across the three-disc, four-hour affair, we hear facets of all the various phases Milieu has gone through over the years - from the mid-fi melodies over slow tempos to the house and techno-inflected groovers, from the glitchy atmospheric pieces to the deep ambient odysseys, right on up to present day Milieu, a playful bedroom braindance sound. For both longtime listeners and new recruits, Butcher Block Andromeda should be a fresh and colorful experience of vibrant electronic music, newly minted with a 2014 paint job.\n**Digital version comes with seven high-resolution Milieu desktop wallpapers, designed by Eric Adrian Lee.",

            "about": "Following the first tripartite volume of 'Butcher Block Andromeda' - a 2014 retrospective that collected fifty tracks from a decade of work - is this second volume, another thirty-three tracks across another three discs that looks back on the second decade of Milieu recordings.\nWhat can even be said now, that will accurately sum up what twenty years of creative work felt like? Certainly nothing more can be added to what the music itself already offers, but as with all these anniversaries and round-numbered milestones, it feels more than a little shallow to speak up and tell everyone it's your birthday again. It is from this perspective that I often feel like I am not really the man behind the music, that I have only deceived everyone into thinking that I'm an artist - *this* artist, even - and that the flood of material accumulated across twenty years has simply happened around me.\nNo, it's a dissonant feeling - wanting to celebrate the things you feel you have accomplished, however jaundiced and unnatural they may appear to be, while also feeling as if you're a stranger at your own birthday party, surrounded and overwhelmed by the evidence that yes, you are that person who did these things - these things that, over time, less and less resemble what you thought you were doing, or what you meant to be saying, instead revealed to be artifacts from a process in motion, merely evidence that you were there, and you're only misremembering what happened.\nIt has been a long and tiresome process to sift through another ten years of recordings this year, having started the process loosely in the end of the last Winter, formally in April, and realizing as the months pass that you're much further away from a complete thought than you initially estimated. Were it not for close friends and confidantes helping me along the way, giving me contexts and feedback where I needed it, 'Butcher Block II' may have sunk completely out of the weight of my uncertainties. Immense gratitude is owed to Greg Lawhun, who beautifully realized the visual world that these collected artifacts existed in, illustrating no less than three inset color-themed panels (one for each side of this volume), a huge gatefold image of my fantasist landscape, and two more pieces for an accompanying book (more on that shortly).\nThe thirty-three tracks chosen for 'Butcher Block II' are all of my favorite compositions from the last decade, and while I tried very hard to be equitable with regard to \"one track from a given album per disc,\" the reality is simply that two albums in particular - 'The Flower to Disappear' and 'Watch the Head' - have far outshined much of what preceded them, in terms of my own personal appraisal of process/result, and as such they occupy a slightly larger percentage of the three discs than I initially intended. I hope you will find, however, that ultimately the decisions made for sequencing and arrangement won out, and that all three discs of 'Butcher Block II' feel like three of the very best albums I've ever made.\nI've also made my peace with the opposite possibility - that doing this retrospective in no way overwrites or erases the original albums, their original mastering jobs or any of my original ideas. 'Butcher Block II' is exactly what it says it is - a beginner's guide to Milieu, a twenty year long project of hundreds of albums and EPs that is doomed to come up short in how accurately it portrays the amount of recordings there are, even with three discs covering only the last ten years. The other active element to consider with Milieu recordings from 2014 on is that Milieu tracks have themselves become longer and denser, and it's been a very long time since I was regularly writing three or four-minute tracks. I'm still not sure what this says about me, whether it's a Frank Herbert \"there's just so much material and editing it is a lost cause\" situation, or if the compositions themselves are justified in the runtime they occupy - that part is for you to decide.\nThere's been so many things bubbling up to the surface as I've arranged this set - not just memories of writing and recording the music, but the desires, events, locations and people who helped shape them in the first place. It wasn't so much a sense of nostalgia as a critical mass of information, and I soon realized that three panels of a CD sleeve with some penned liner notes would never work. So the idea then became to write a few things for every track I chose to be here - sort of like what Billy did in the liner notes for 'Pisces Iscariot' - and, as you can then imagine, I felt like the idea was sound enough to apply it to all of the major Milieu retrospectives - both volumes of 'Butcher Block' and all three volumes of the supplemental 'Sunbather's Pharmacopeia' collections, totaling 124 tracks across nine discs of music - leaving me with a paperback book of just over 200 pages.\nThis book, aptly titled 'Knows No Bounds' is intended as a \"listener's companion\" to Milieu, specifically using the retrospective albums as a map. It delves into the technical and romantic sides of my creative process, carrying with it a fair amount of self-deprecating humor and gratitude for many other brilliant people who are just as bound up in the last twenty years of Milieu as I. It probably answers quite a few questions, avoiding others and asking quite a few more. It also contains a text discography for all Milieu recordings, up to the point of the next album, at least.\nThat said, it's completely superfluous. All that ever matters here is the music, and anything I can write about it will only ever return to the act of listening. This feels correct to me, because after twenty years of work, I feel less that I have made anything, and much more that I have spent the time listening and exploring, drawing a frame around the moments that felt special or interesting, sometimes (if I was lucky) even profound. It has become my life's work to repeat this process, to let the soundwaves carry me tangentially where they will, and to relay back my travelogues in the hopes that somewhere - or somewhen - somebody else understands it.\nWhether you have drifted this far out with me across the decades, or your own travels have crossed paths with mine at some other junction point, I want to thank you for being a part of it, a participant in this surrealistic conversation. I raise my glass to you - here's to another twenty years.",

            "about": "\"Collecting, I traverse the garden, the world—but soon\nI pass the gates,\nNow along the pond-side—now wading in a little,\nfearing not the wet,\nNow by the post-and-rail fences,\nwhere the old stones thrown there,\npick'd from the fields, have accumulated,\nWild-flowers and vines and weeds come up\nthrough the stones,\nand partly cover them—Beyond these I pass,\nFar, far in the forest, before I think where I go,\nSolitary, smelling the earthy smell,\nstopping now and then in the silence\"\n-W. Whitman, excerpt from 'These I, Singing in Spring'\nChiasmus follows the considerable lineage of longform generative ambient works such as Creation, A Small Fire, Cirrus and Zephyrean with a nearly nine-hour meditation on the duality of nature, the cross-modulation of desire and contentment and the gradient of temperature and barometric changes in the transition from Winter to Spring.\nAll of these things exist definitively within Chiasmus, and yet, Chiasmus is simply a wordless expression of a process, guided by the ghost of emotional impulse and preconceived notions of what the future may yet become. It fills the empty vessels of space and time with an invisible element that vibrates and resounds, and echoes back the questions I hadn't quite thought to ask.\nIt is this mirrored relationship between mind and pseudo-mind (or machine, for those following my abstract analogies) that conveys the real and true purpose of the creative act - the ability to build just enough of a facsimile of my own thoughts and decisions in order to converse with it, and hopefully understand better what I thought I understood before.\nHave I taught myself anything? Is this even possible? Is the feedback of talking to oneself about oneself capable of accumulating into an expansion of awareness? Or is the human condition simply this mundane and easily tricked? Are all the elaborate programs and systems we design merely fragmented mirrors of our own thinking, capable only of surpassing us in our most fleeting of resources, our greatest and irreparable weakness - time?\nDoes the act of fast-tracking human decisions and thought processes in fact give us a new vantage point on a life fully lived, a program run to its logical completion? Is a generative system, in this way, a window to that oft-imagined afterworld? The divinity of the last new knowledge?\nAnd when I say this aloud, and write it in the air, as I am saying and doing right now, do we share in this moment of disconnected understanding? If I slip a message into time's frothing currents, and I am gone by the time you receive it, does my message change? Am I doomed to be the only one to ever ask or answer any of my own questions?\nChiasmus is an offering of gentle and sonorous sound, to soften the blow of these considerations, to round off the edges of this tragic philosophical maw. I would like it to be something that leads you slowly by the hand, whispering secrets in runic murmurs, drawing you toward exotic and unexpected lands of discovery, all the while tracing a line like a river across the map, where the terminus leads not only to a wider, endless ocean of new understanding, but the realization that you have been alone all along.\nOriginal YouTube broadcast:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=S35bXf2YLDs\nFor at least 2 new generative ambient releases delivered to your inbox each month, consider subscribing to Vibratelepathos:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\nVibratelepathos: It's music...I think.",

            "about": "Colortone was recorded in 2008 and released in 2009, and remains one of the most well-known and loved Milieu albums. It is arguably the last iteration of the \"downtempo\" Milieu sound, in that the following album (Swaying Palms) began to incorporate more processing and dance-oriented material, rather than dedicated slow and feel-good music. Colortone is an incredibly melodic set of warm Summer electronics, and both the sound of the album and the idyllic Holga-shot cover photograph live up to the title. Warped and psychedelic at times, reserved and contemplative at others. A lot of love went into making Colortone, and so it is only fair that this reissue include all relevant remixes, outtakes and alternate versions from the original session recordings. This comprehensive double-disc set compiles all material on both the Cropduster and Jacket Holograph EPs, as well as the exclusive tracks from Suntanned Melodies (a bonus disc included in only the first 25 copies of the original pressing). Superb remix work appears from Mrs Jynx (Planet Mu), Ten and Tracer (U-Cover), Forrest (U-Cover) and Obfusc (Boltfish).",
            "credits": "released April 20, 2013\nW/P by Brian Grainger, except where noted. Recorded at 114RKD, 2008. This is Milieu Music number AD8, and eighth in the ongoing Arboreal Digest reissue series.",

            "about": "\"This is thy hour O Soul,\nthy free flight into the wordless,\nAway from books, away from art,\nthe day erased, the lesson done,\nThee fully forth emerging, silent, gazing,\npondering the themes thou lovest best,\nNight, sleep, death and the stars.\"\n-Walt Whitman, \"A Clear Midnight\"\n'Compline' is the ninth published recording in the ongoing Sleepbuilding series, originally broadcast live on February 26, 2023. It consists of the beloved 2HP Pluck synthesizer, a paraphonic Karplus-Strong device, playing an Aeolian scale with timing information for the sequencer originating from a Turing machine, even-numbered and Boolean clock dividers and Missed Opportunities' probabilistic/subtractive trigger array. This is all an overly detailed way of explaining that 'Compline' is a fully generative composition, like all Sleepbuilding broadcasts, made manifest by an arrangement of directed electricity and some simple mathematics.\nA small note about the title I have chosen for this piece: 'Compline' is the last of the canonical hours in the day, observed in many variations by many different Western religions, which is devoted to late night introspection, relaxation and silence. It is my intent to only use the visual idea of this canonical hour to represent something that is designed for late night usage - a vibratelepathic candle to light beside your bed, perhaps - and not imply a deeper or more symbolic reference to any religious view at all. I have always felt that one can be in accord with spiritual matters while also not ascribing to religious considerations, and this is the context I wish to invoke for 'Compline.' Of course, if you are yourself a pious person, then my intention for 'Compline' should not exclude you from enjoying the piece either.\nAs with all prior and subsequent Sleepbuilding broadcasts, 'Compline' will be a free release, offered in the optimistic hope that it can and will meet others where and when they are, and be whatever they need it to become in that moment. I become more fond of stating with every new release that there are no wrong answers here, no way to use this sound-material that will betray its purpose. It continues to bring me joy to find that other creative work has been facilitated in part with the presence of my own in someone else's time and space, but it is equally gratifying to know that this music is helping someone to sleep, or read, or simply tune out the noise of the outside world. Don't work too hard, take care of yourself and please be well. Enjoy the soundwaves.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe seventh volume, COOLBREEZE REFRESHMENT TIME, was improvised and broadcast on August 13, 2018 as one of two live sets that served as a \"decompression\" for my cluttered and exhausted brain, in the wake of two months' deep production work finishing the Sun Cast triple-album. As such, it is a loose and funky affair, with lots of spastic changes and blatant disregard for staying put. Also included here are two sections of a second set, broadcast earlier on June 23, that was tagged with the name DECOMPRESSION SESSION. Both sets were made using the same gear configuration: A Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer, Teenage Electronics PO-12 drum machine, Korg Volca Bass/Beats/Keys/Sample, Roland SH-32 polyphonic digital synthesizer, Arturia Microbrute monophonic analog synthesizer, Korg MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer, Boss DR-110 analog drum machine and a large array of outboard analog/digital FX. Stylistically, both sets almost drunkenly wander their way through acid, techno, ambient minimalism and Autechre-influenced spasmodic IDM. Melodies, basslines and drum patterns are thrown around the stereo field like paint on a Pollock, making for a truly palate-cleansing and ear-flossing experience.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary.

            "about": "\"What do you suppose creation is?\nWhat do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free\nand own no superior?\nWhat do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways,\nbut that man or woman is as good as god?\nAnd that there is no god any more divine than Yourself?\nAnd that that is what the oldest and newest myths finally mean?\nAnd that you or any one must approach creations\nthrough such laws?\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from 'Laws for Creations'\nCreation is a twelve-hour generative work, originally broadcast via YouTube on October 19th 2022, consisting of Karplus-Strong synthesizers, analog filtering, Euclidean sequencing, granular processing and a number of spatial and modulation effects. It has, by necessity, been presented here in separate sections, due to Bandcamp's file size restrictions for individual uploads.\nAs today is the midterm election day in the United States, I wanted to publish something lengthy, soothing and freely downloadable, in an attempt to thrust some good back into the world, which as of this writing, still feels quite certain about dragging us into the darkness. In many discussions with my wife, my daughter and my friends, I repeatedly voiced my discontent with the nature of these elections, how utterly ridiculous it is to be perpetually stuck in a situation that feels so totally out of our control, while also being doomed to bear the grief of the outcome ourselves. How I'm still longing for a world where we could go cast our votes, and not feel that so much sanity and balance in our day-to-day lives is held in the clutches of so many misinformed and self-righteous strangers.\nI realize this is all \"pie in the sky,\" that I'm showing my naivete as some kind of stoned idealist who just wants everyone to get along and be nice to each other - what an absurd notion - but as I said before on various copy texts, inaction and silence are guaranteed to result in things not only not changing, but actively getting worse. You cannot expect systems to improve by refusing to participate in them, but at the same time, you cannot feel as if you've accomplished any change at all by simply participating.\nThis is where I have decided, again, that what I *can* do is offer creative work to the world. Art for the sake of art. Addition instead of subtraction. The pursuit of life, love and happiness. And so Creation is exactly, and only, this - a refutation of the negative, with as much strength as I can muster from behind my studio desk, and I am just so tired. Tired of everything, ready for something easy, something soft and happy.\nLet this be my contribution to that conversation.\nN.B. The original broadcast can be listened to without breaks here:  youtu.be/gTl1BrKM0ns",

            "about": "Three tracks recorded during the extensive DAUGHTER sessions, but omitted from the triple-album collection for runtime and/or stylistic reasons. Originally available only as a bonus CD-R packaged with limited special editions of Daughter's AD44 reissue. Since shipping physical goods is somewhat stalled at the moment, this felt appropriate to put out in a digital release. Also included is the fourth track, a previously unheard/unreleased extended version of \"Lakewater\", in a deeper and more ambient alternate mix, which was originally intended for a supplemental cassette release.",
            "credits": "released April 7, 2020\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at White Pillar Workshop, 2018. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Design and text by ABM&D. This is Milieu Music number AD44B, and 44Bth in the Arboreal Digest reissue catalog.  www.milieu-music.com  /  www.analogbotany.com",

            "about": "Earlier this year, in March, the vibrant and varied analog label Illuminated Paths issued an album called Daughter, in a double-cassette edition. This original release was intended to be strictly limited, and although the four sides provided 2 hours of material, IP-354 (Daughter's catalog designate) represented only an abridged (and somewhat mutated) iteration of the original album. Having now gone out of print, I feel comfortable in issuing the full Daughter sessions as they were originally laid to tape.\nAs an album, Daughter was somewhat drafted as a namesake follow-up on Brother, from which I have grown a little estranged through the years. I wanted to reapproach the idea, topically at least, of an ambient session record that connected me to my family life, but in a current and sincere way. Having become a father 7 years ago, my outlook on a number of things has changed, and I have since looked back at that moment, many different times, as a line drawn in the sand of my memory, behind which my past self lay buried. If that sounds maudlin, it isn't - I am in fact happier here and now than I have ever been in my life. Living in this breezy Ohio valley with my family has brought me eloquently into a new era of creative work and domestic happiness.\nAnd so, with Daughter, the second focus during these sessions was to do something entirely new and unheard of, at least within the Milieu side of the fence. How to accomplish something new, after hundreds of records, and even more hours of recordings? I looked to a longtime fascination of mine - FM synthesis - which was something I'd toyed with in the past, for things like basslines and a pad sound here or there, but mostly, I knew very little about it and had yet to really immerse myself in it for any length of time. The decision was made to set myself up with an FM synthesizer, one which was in fact portable enough to take with me everywhere I went, and generate enough material while I was out and about to build an album with when I brought it back to the Workshop. As you can see from the amount of music presented here, over four hours of music ended up being created, so the Illuminated Paths release was a good way to sift through it, at least at the time.\nIt was no coincidence either, that Daughter was initially issued on tape. The operative plan was to \"soften\" the digital sounds created via the FM synthesis with analog tape, although my final mixdown of Daughter's material, here in the studio, also saw me making regular use of analog filters (from Moog, Arturia, Akai and Korg) as well as analog reverb/delay boxes, further mutating the album into an amalgam of analog and digital that, in the end, just seems to sound like Milieu.\nHopefully, the filmic sheen and pitch-bent weirdness that I was chasing down with FM synthesis still comes through the ambient Milieu haze. To me, it does still have some very specific moments that, melodically, may not have otherwise happened on an analog synthesizer. Altogether, I think this collection of synthesis experiments makes for an engaging and longform volume of bedroom electronic music, and as it was being completed alongside other Milieu albums (such as Sun Cast), very personal locations, past events and people were very much on my mind. Daughter exists as an expansive soundtrack to no film at all, just the reels and reels of imagined time and space that I never grow tired of exploring.\n**NOTE: An ultra-limited edition of the 3xCD set is being offered with a bonus 4th CD containing over half an hour of session outtakes. This extra disc is packaged separately from the main 3xCD set - the absolutely complete Daughter experience!",

            "about": "\"The sun was warm but the wind was chill.\nYou know how it is with an April day\nWhen the sun is out and the wind is still,\nYou’re one month on in the middle of May.\nBut if you so much as dare to speak,\nA cloud comes over the sunlit arch,\nA wind comes off a frozen peak,\nAnd you’re two months back in the middle of March.\"\n-Robert Frost, excerpt from \"Two Tramps in Mud Time\"\nSometimes, it feels foolish to say something, while other times, it feels foolish to remain silent. Following this, there are even times when one feels foolish whether they do or do not speak. In these moments, which seem to be the ones that feel as if they last for much longer than they actually do, I must simply admit that I am a fool - out of place, out of time, outside of my bandwidth - and so this moment, today, is as good as any to illuminate this fact, and perhaps even celebrate it, as a fool would celebrate their own inadequacies. This is my lot, and if you are reading this, it may be your lot too - to exist in this time and space where it is almost impossible to tell what is right, and what is not - and if there can be no changing the direction of the wind around me, to that degree, then let me be still here, while I may still be here, thinking out loud, a fool talking to himself in this transparent moment of suspended awareness, bereft of everything. Let the wind blowing through this valley speak, in the only wordless tongue it can know.",

            "about": "Commissioned music for Sebastian Gansrigler's short film WOLFGANG SCHÖN: DER LETZTE KUPFERDRUCKER, a documentary about Europe's last copper printer in Vienna, Austria. With a subject so inherently melancholic, the music assumes a position of submission, ebbing out subtle movements over the course of an hour. It is improvised electric guitar music from the perspective of loss, mournfully missing someone. Within the Milieu canon, Kupferdrucker lies somewhere between the melodic drone pastures of Leaves Painted Purple and the ambient blues of Empty Roads. Gansrigler's film is a much less elaborate affair at six minutes long, yet upon viewing one understands just how much those six minutes can say. There are little universes inside the shadows of Schön's quiet workshop, spaces that are perhaps inhabited by emotive vessels such as these.\nWatch the film:  vimeo.com/129823855\nVisit the website:  kupfer.gansrigler.com",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few (my favorite in this collection is 'The Aestival Wind'). It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume Five of the Divergent Paths series collects the following eight sessions:\nPATHOS 33 - Tropospheric Scatter\nPATHOS 34 - The Neverending Well\nPATHOS 35 - Synchysis\nPATHOS 36 - Saturnalian Embers\nPATHOS 37 - The Aestival Wind\nPATHOS 38 - A Cloak of Flowers\nPATHOS 39 - Cyanine Catacombs of Sublimity\nPATHOS 40 - Synchysis II\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics",

Spacious and windswept music that instantly transports me to surrealistic scenery I've never physically witnessed before - an Alaskan mountain, covered in green treetops, crowned with an abandoned radar array, bleached beneath the orange sun. Perhaps, if I'm lucky, this recording can bring you there too.",

Sections of 'Chiasmus' were altered via time-domain pitch shifting, parametric equalization and other directional/textural changes, before being routed through a specifically designed patch within Goldwave's Frequency Blend processor and pulled apart further by a fast Fourier transform. The resultant audio resembles certain aspects of 'Chiasmus' but is an entirely new piece of music, much quieter, more spacious, pillow-like and relaxing. As the snow drifts scatter all through the air in the furious wind outside the studio, 'Synchysis' feels apt for a counterpoint.",

In truth, Spring is just as much Winter as it is Summer, and so it follows that I still have a need for cozy warm sound to curl up beside as I would have in the snowy months. 'Saturnalian Embers' is one such piece, initially recorded on December 23rd, 2022, fully snowed in, with the sole source of my Stravinskian windchimes on my back porch being routed through the modular system.\nAlthough I have sampled these same chimes many times over, they always seem to yield a different chordal profile, with different dominant tones determined by whatever the wind decided to play that day. This piece could almost be a Coppice Halifax recording, as it contains an almost dub near-minor chord that comes and goes as filter sweeps swell and recede, and stands as yet another example of music that seems to exist in many of my creative landscapes simultaneously. The process and workflow involved, however, are what makes it a Vibratelepathos piece, emphasizing not just the voice of the work, but the way that voice articulates itself across the runtime.",

                    "about": "2023.05.28\nEvery season, especially those I've experienced in the Midwest, consist of certain days that are defined by unseasonable weather. This could perhaps be the way it has always been, or it could be a darker implication of the climate changing, but either way, today is such a day. It is late May, the month of my birth, where for the majority of the 40 years I've lived on Earth, I have felt that May was a Summer month, despite its very firm definition as a Spring month. This was owed to the fact that the subtropics I grew up within had such a limited range of weather, that the entire calendar year may as well be Summer or some slight variation upon it. So when I relocated to Ohio in 2016, the seasons and their changes were instantly magical, and I felt as if I'd finally, for the very first time, experienced them. Today, the wind blows in the orange sunshine, and the sidewalks are warm and glowing offwhite next to the Bradburian green everywhere there is not pavement. The wind is ever so slightly warmer, arriving like a herald announcing that his Lord Summer is imminently fast approaching. Still, even such an uncharacteristic day for the Ohioan Spring, it would be considered nothing short of paradise for South Carolinians - a momentary respite from the oppressive browbeating of Green Hell. I have decided to think of these precognitive visions of the next season as entities of their own, and this warm blanket slipped in on the Spring breeze is The Aestival Wind. Perhaps, in the early world, when man could not survive without a deep acknowledgement of the natural world's ways, they had their own name for The Aestival Wind. Perhaps, it was a god or a non-corporeal being. Perhaps it was not noticed at all.",

It originated as a self-oscillating Doepfer bandpass filter playing a Lydian scale, and was further shaped by the Frequency Blend processor in Goldwave alongside other filters, modulators and delays.\nAs 'Zephyrean' was emblematic of Spring's arrival, 'A Cloak of Flowers' recalls this year's milder Spring season during what seems to be an equally mild and rainy Summer, although the season is still only recently begun, and it could simply be taking longer to awaken. Dulcet and glassy tones reverberate in a shimmering wreath around our heads, at times saturating the air and receding into a mere bronze-green tint at others. This piece would pair well with a breezy outdoor walk, sitting in the grass and watching the clouds move by, and is guaranteed to make those things seem as if they are moving too fast by comparison.",

The synthesizer is playing the Dorian scale, and has been processed twofold: first, sent through a custom patch in Goldwave's Frequency Blend processor, and second, routed through a convolution reverb using an impulse response from the Inchindown oil tanks in Scotland - the world's longest reverberation time in a man-made structure.\nDespite all of these seemingly technical details, 'Cyanine' feels pointedly organic, and brings to mind images of expansive liminal spaces, empty and cathedral-like, but placid and still. The composition itself is somewhat liminal, existing between the tropes of the Vibratelepathos series and the Sleepbuilding sessions of overnight generative A/V broadcasts. 'Cyanine' is a soft blue-green waterway for your mind to drift through on a pleasantly vacant Summer evening.",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few (my favorite in this collection is easily 'Sun Keep Vigil'). It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume Four of the Divergent Paths series collects the following eight sessions:\nPATHOS 25 - Pillars of the Firmament\nPATHOS 26 - Therian Cymbal\nPATHOS 27 - Sangean Sea III\nPATHOS 28 - Sun Keep Vigil\nPATHOS 29 - Shimmering Digital Transients\nPATHOS 30 - Pumula Riverbanks\nPATHOS 31 - Summering Totemic\nPATHOS 32 - This Woven Altar\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics.",

                    "about": "For the 25th PATHOS catalog release, I have decided to do what was done with Blue Emerald Halftone - issue a session that presently came to pass, in order to keep the Vibra catalog up to date, at least periodically, as many of these sessions are published up to two years after they have taken place.\nPillars of the Firmament is a somewhat new-age session with the Korg Opsix, an altered FM synthesizer, which is to say a six-operator FM synth that is also capable of many other possible configurations, thanks to an extensive internal patching matrix, voluminous libraries of waveforms to use as carriers and modulators, multiple filter profiles (themselves patterned after more famous machines such as the MS-20 and Poly 6) and a deep array of FX processors, from the staple reverbs, delays, pans and filtering to more esoteric things such as granular glitch-effects, amp and speaker emulation, gain circuits and wavefolding.\nHere, the Opsix explores a patch I made, centering around Karplus-like voices that are held infinitely by way of tricking the machine's damper input into thinking that its polarity has been inverted, essentially sustaining tone forever. Four layers of this sustained sound have been dubbed together and tuned separate from one another, resulting in a swirling blanket of warmth that definitely doesn't bring to mind the surface idea of digital synthesis, which often comes with a maligned reputation for being cold and harsh. The Opsix is a deep machine, with limitations of its own, of course, but certainly capable of a lot of new sounds that I've not been able to easily achieve outside of software in my studio.\nThematically, the session conjured up images of the heavens, albeit old-world depictions of the heavens found frequently in works of classical art, which usually reflected a more primitive understanding of the cosmos, or an outright religious depiction of it. This felt oddly appropriate considering the Opsix's ability to convey unnatural yet organically shaped sound, almost deceitfully coming out of a digital workflow. It is the divine rendered in plastic and metal, fashioned by longing hands that can only imagine what the stars and spheres really are, so upward they build, deified and profane towers of humanity's hope, reaching out like Adam to grasp the hand of God, but never reaching that destination. The grandeur of futility, and the futility of grandeur.",

                    "about": "Therian Cymbal was a single session from October 27th, 2021, recorded as a soundcheck for an upcoming live broadcast from the studio. It is a simple piece, built using only a sample of my late dog Charly whining in our van during the long drive up from South Carolina to Ohio in 2016 as its sole source.\nHilariously, we knew beforehand that he did not travel well in a vehicle, so our vet gave us some sedatives for him to ease his stress on the long trip...and they did absolutely nothing. It was no big surprise that a stoic goodboy such as Charly would power through sedatives in order to continue his sad singing, so I recorded it at the time, half as a joke, and half as a document of just what the chaotic and terrible move was really like, lest I ever forget and somehow decide moving 600 miles is a good idea again. In hindsight, I'm grateful to my past self for recording Charly in that moment, as it is now a way for me to integrate him into my work in the same way I integrate any other things that I love and respect, and I have long felt that as long as someone remembers and thinks about you, you're never really gone.\nThis exact sample has already appeared in numerous Milieu tracks as the voice of melodic developments, with \"Six or Eight\" and \"Planet Everfree\" coming to mind at the moment, and remains one of those special aural artifacts in my sample library that never leave any of my sampler devices. Having lost Charly to cancer just over a year ago, he's been on my mind a bit more than usual, but he's never very far from my thoughts, and having just recently lost our cat, Boris, as well, it occurred to me that this recording existed in my archive, and would be aptly released as, hopefully, a source of comfort for anyone who has lost an animal member of their family.\nHowever, I do not wish for this release to be listened to from a hushed and maudlin perspective - quite the opposite. I would like for the sound generated to become something entirely other, proof positive that a significant amount of art and creative work are simply the results of catharsis, the transfiguration of suffering into sweetness.",

                    "about": "Sangean Sea III is a slight misnomer, as this session was generated by a CCrane hurricane radio, tuned to something/somewhere on the FM band, and not the Sangean shortwave radio that initiated this session header. In hindsight, this is a small deviation from the original path, and so with this third iteration of Sangean Sea, the header expands to include any radio-sourced experiments.\nThis session was a relatively simple setup, relying heavily on extremely slow envelopes modulating a highpass and a bandpass filter, with a chorus-modulated reverb on the aux send, and a single stereo-inverted delay of the pre-reverb signal path. A \"nothing and nowhere\" location on the FM band was found and then sent into Mutable Instruments Clouds, where it was used as a constant sampling input source for the eight-second buffer, and rearranged probabilistically before being sent back out through a granular reverb. The highpass filter is heard first, slowly opening to allow more and more of the lower frequency spectrum, then when it has completely opened, the bandpass filter is introduced over time, with its initial position locked in the sub-bass range with a bit of resonance applied. Once the dry/wet mix fully transitions to the bandpass, another slow envelope begins to sweep the bandpass filter's central frequency upward, until it too leaves only the high frequency band. At this point, the original envelope that introduced the bandpass filter's saturation is inverted, to slowly re-reveal the original state of the radio band, with no filtering applied at all, and slowly, again the highpass filter is reintroduced, and fully saturates the piece until nothing but static is left to fade out.\nThe purpose of this session was to explore, very slowly and almost pointillistically, the presence of all possible frequencies simultaneous in noise, albeit noise generated via radio tuner and not a noise generator within a synthesizer. By slowly moving the center of a filter around the frequency spectrum, different tonal and textural characteristics are emphasized at different moments, with the reverberation applied in the auxiliary send allowing all of this change in color to occur in a greater \"external\" space, simulating the natural reverberation of the outdoors, perhaps a wooded clearing away from buildings. A solitary retreat in the forest, still longing for and dreaming of the vivid sea, while the waves are eventually revealed to be nothing more than an out of tune radio next to a sleeping bag in a dim tent.",

                    "about": "Sun Keep Vigil was the first session recorded when I returned to the ARP 2600, after taking some time away since 2021. I recently ordered some custom 3d printed white fader caps from a very nice engineer in Germany, to make the ARP's 63 faders a bit easier on the fingers, and somewhat unsurprisingly, the tactile changes have altered what I now do with this machine in subtle ways. Sun Keep Vigil is, at it's heart, a very simple patch, with all three oscillators in the 2600 playing a shelf register sequence in the major pentatonic scale (via Ornament & Crime), that is using the digits of Pi to inform the timing and the octave range of the sequence. From there, the 2600 shapes and colors the sound with modulation from an internal LFO and a mechanical spring reverb tank within the unit itself, and this audio is then routed into a granular processor, which pulls the information apart inside a buffer, and reiterates it probabilistically, with beautiful long reverb tails. The resultant recording is a peaceful one, recalling mental images of an undisturbed stone shrine, on a remote island, that contains a magical stone on an altar, absorbing the sun's rays over thousands of years, waiting for a ship to land outside the temple walls and retrieve it, in some incalculably distant age.",

During this time, extensive experiments were being done with routing anything and everything that produced a sound in the White Pillar Workshop into the system, simply for the act of observing the results. In this case, the Korg ER-1 digital drum synthesizer was chosen for a session, and heavily processing the machine's output within a granular drone setting manifested a wonderful shimmering wall (as Brian Evenson may have put it himself). I have long championed the ER-1 as my personal favorite drum machine, because it does not rely on a bank of samples, but rather, behaves more like an FM synthesizer with a few waveforms of pure sound that are shaped via frequency/amplitude/cross modulation, a high/lowpass filter, a digital delay that resembles the PT2399 and a powerful motion sequencing capability to automate nearly every function. It also includes two dedicated external inputs that can facilitate feedback loops as well as realtime sampling from outer sources, and so it follows that this machine performs quite well alongside a modular system that is designed to process and transfigure sound from any provenance. Eventually, more ER-1/R-EW sessions will likely come to pass, but for now, this singular drone session stands as a testament to the strength of the ER-1 and the otherworldly versatility of the R-EW system, even at that early point in its development.",

The result is a warm and flowing cloud of Karplus Strong synthesis that doesn't seem to resemble any of the tools or processes used to manifest it. The title was derived generatively using an eclectic anagram generator, although incidentally the word 'pumula' is a Zulu word that means rest and relaxation. This was, as Bob Ross was fond of saying, a happy accident, and it should be mentioned transparently that I have no interest in appropriating African language for my own uses, and that any relation to this beyond the topical title is incidental and wholly unintended.\nGenerative music frequently presents me with a number of challenges, which are by design very different than those involved in compositional work, and one such challenge is the reality of the process, which provides me with beautiful musical recordings quicker than I have the ability to even name them. This highlights the need for session headers that are reliably reused in the Vibra catalog, but for singular recordings such as this one, a bit more imagination must still be employed.\nThe irony of having to apply manual effort in order to publish generative music is not lost on me, but I hope that the material, as ever, says more than anything I could ever hope to write or imply. The system is the music, and any derivations from it are just tributaries that run back to its ever-growing wellspring.",

It explores overtones of bell-like surfaces and metallic resonance, through a lens of softened filtering and probabilistic granular synthesis, producing a warm bath of tones that accumulate into a comfortable fog. Influenced in part by Wolfgang Voigt's earlier GAS recordings, as well as a little bit of Oval's 94 Diskont in the chordal profiles, Summering Totemic is a slight recall of warmer weather held back from publication until the coldest season arrives, where it will be more apt for cozy listening and disarming meditative usages.",

This session's source sound originated from the same recording that produced Fabled Key, and should be seen as an alternative dimension of that piece, perhaps illustrating what an Arturia Microfreak may have sounded like in the hands of 2006-2007 era Milieu.",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few. It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume One of the Divergent Paths series collects the first eight sessions:\nPATHOS 1 - Amethyst Extracts\nPATHOS 2 - Inverse Grey\nPATHOS 3 - Inverse Grey II\nPATHOS 4 - Mother of Cosmos\nPATHOS 5 - Mother of Cosmos II\nPATHOS 6 - White Nothing\nPATHOS 7 - Kinematic Initiatives\nPATHOS 8 - Roman Fountains\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics.",

                    "about": "KINEMATIC INITIATIVES are sessions of generative modular & non-modular sound that consist solely of low-frequency oscillators (typically only used for modulation purposes in the sub-audible range) that move at rates quickly enough to bring them into the audible range. Within this framework, each LFO is independently tuned from the others, to form interesting harmonic layers presented as a massive, multi-voiced chord. This first volume of such recordings was located on one of three large-capacity thumb drives used for direct board recording on the Peavey FX2 mixing desk, without a date, but it is presumed to be from sometime in the chaotic Summer of 2020.",

                    "about": "ROMAN FOUNTAINS is one of two (so far) pieces generated by way of selectively sampling Impressionist piano music, processing it with FFT (fast fourier transforms:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform  ) and then routing the resultant audio into the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. These experiments are always interesting, if for no other purpose besides learning new things about my existing generative systems and processors, things that may not have been quite so evident if I were not inputting music that was pre-recorded as opposed to being sporadically performed or created. ROMAN FOUNTAINS follows a similar methodology as WHITE NOTHING, but as you can plainly hear, the differences between the two are massive, as not only the original sampled music is different, but the instruments have changed as well, and yet both ROMAN FOUNTAINS and WHITE NOTHING manage to feel cohesive in some ways also, inhabiting domains of tonal music while almost completely avoiding recognizable melodic movements or other compositional conventions. Sonically, ROMAN FOUNTAINS brings to my mind what it may sound like if Brian Eno were to have written a score for a game in Cyan's Myst video game series, particularly Riven, which remains a big influence on much of my work. This is to say, it glides through passages of chordal unison that drift apart and back together again, while the voices of these movements themselves shift between textures that resemble bassoon, metal horns, FM synthesizers and even electric guitar. For being so constantly shifting and in-motion, ROMAN FOUNTAINS is a very placid listening environment that I hope you enjoy bathing in as much as I continue to.",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few (my favorite in this collection is 'Change Ringing'). It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume Seven of the Divergent Paths series collects the following eight sessions:\nPATHOS 49 - A Divination at the Speechless Wall\nPATHOS 50 - Rainfall on the Rusted Bell\nPATHOS 51 - Forest Line\nPATHOS 52 - Laves Tilings\nPATHOS 53 - Drawing Hope From a Fountain of Evening Sun\nPATHOS 54 - Declination\nPATHOS 55 - Six Mapped Channels\nPATHOS 56 - Change Ringing\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics.",

Coaxing very formant/vocal overtones out of these machines is a constant fascination, and arguably a major reason for using them (especially the Waldorf machine, which makes prodigious use of text-to-speech synthesis), and here this particular facet of wavetable music is the primary color in the composition.",

This session is procedurally generated by resampling the input of the original broadcast and reorganizing it with granular tools, panned delays, filters, pitch processors and fast Fourier transforms. It is an apt companion piece to 'Time Bell' in both a topical sense and a philosophical one—it places the composition into different contexts, with different considerations, and paints a solemn picture of entropic decline as the years pass by. I have long been fascinated with the notion that entropy applies to time itself, even though I've had many discussions with other thinkers about it and the general consensus is that entropy is simply what happens when time exists and modulates everything within it. It is an interesting thought, however, to think that even time as a process—or something alive in a way we cannot perceive it—must also have a beginning, middle and end, and will one day stop. Even the largest and slowest wave, riding with the tallest crest, will one day return to the shore.",

Using the same granular resampling system in Goldwave that has yielded many different variations within the Vibra releases, 'Forest Line' also explores a probabilistic resampler processing two stereo-swapped iterations of the audio, further reorganizing the music as sound-matter rather than something that follows compositional linearity. Two different Arturia low-pass filters were also employed to further color the sound, and finally the full summed mix was routed through a convolution reverb running an impulse response of the Inchindown oil tanks in Scotland - one of the longest reverberant spaces in the world. NOTE: 'Forest Line' has been mixed a little quieter than other recordings in this catalog. This is intentionally done for my own personal sleep-music usages, but as usual, how you prefer to listen to my music is up to you.",

I'd played briefly with the Virt Iter voice when the Legio module arrived, because it came installed with that firmware, but I only did so much work with it since I mainly wanted the machine to be used as a stereo dynamics processor rather than a synthesizer voice (and if that sounds strange, that the same one machine can do both of those things, that is the entire point of what Noise Engineering are doing with their Legio and Versio platforms, making modular machines *themselves* operationally modular). In addition to this session being one of only a few with the Virt Iter Legio voice, it was also one of only a few that explored a user-designed firmware for the Versio - Repetita Versio, a looping multi-channel resampler - and this firmware was also swapped shortly after the 'Laves Tilings' session due to some instabilities in the machine's loop-point behaviors that made it difficult to rely on Repetita for long runtimes. 'Laves Tilings' is in the major pentatonic scale, and uses additional signal processing from Strymon's Starlab and Magneto, as well as a heavy amount of post-processing via Goldwave. More session work will inevitably be undertaken in the future, exploring Legio as a voice rather than a processor, but for now, 'Laves Tilings' stands alone as a bit of an orphan, and I hope you enjoy it despite this.",

This reinterpretation of that material emerged from re-sampling the Solina through Goldwave's Frequency Blend algorithm, then further shaping and processing it via Airwindows, Waldorf's D-Pole and various parametric equalizers. One of many \"possible pasts.\"",

                    "lyrics": "\"Change Ringing\" is an early and informal session with Intellijel's Plonk module - a paraphonic Karplus-Strong synthesizer with instrument modeling by Applied Acoustics Systems. Despite its somewhat unserious name, Plonk is anything but what it implies with a very deep well of synthesis tools and programming options, and so it has taken more time and effort from me to learn it than many other modules have. With modular music and synthesis in general, there's never any big hurry for me to know all of my tools inside and out, and finding my way through them at my own pace is the interesting part. \"Change Ringing\" explores several bell tones playing through the Dorian mode, most of them at such a low octaval range that the overall pitch personality is not immediately apparent, instead offering the listener a dusky landscape of metallic surfaces that gently collide with one another, occasionally resonating out in the dimness. It reminds me of certain Eno compositions on \"The Shutov Assembly\" and \"Neroli\" as well as albums like \"Tintinnabulation\" from Irv Teibel in his Environments series, all of which cast a large and constant shadow over my work in this field.",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few (my favorite in this collection is 'On Being the Bearer and the Beholder'). It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume Six of the Divergent Paths series collects the following eight sessions:\nPATHOS 41 - Wave Dream\nPATHOS 42 - Opening a Mirrored Diamond\nPATHOS 43 - A Weathered Memorial Stone in the Euphonic Meadow\nPATHOS 44 - A Procession at the Pyramid of Geomancy\nPATHOS 45 - The Snow and the Sleeping Hill\nPATHOS 46 - Body Warming\nPATHOS 47 - The Triadic Forest\nPATHOS 48 - On Being the Bearer and the Beholder\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics",

It bridges the spaces between the coastal stargazing 'Ocean Lion IV' and the seaside forest grove illustrated on 'Watch the Head' and 'The Severn Bore,' and conjures vivid imagery of a windswept beach at dusk, as the tide returns a strange glowing book to the shore, singing to us in our dreams, beckoning us to retrieve it. The recording is offered here as a subscriber exclusive, to provide that extra little bit of contextual backdrop for other more mainstream recordings, and to wave goodbye to the Summer.",

Subtle post processing was applied using a convolution reverb, Arturia's JUN-6 chorus, vactrol-like filters and parametric equalization. Much session work and patch development has been done with this Waldorf synthesizer throughout the last two years, but until now, very little of it has ended up in the Vibra catalog, a notable exclusion that led me here. I feel that this session complements the almost nonexistent snow flurries we've had thus far, with the PPG offering pointillistic fragments of melody, like the crystalline fragments of ice falling through the cold wind.",

Loop-focused composition remains a unique approach for me, with many different implications both aesthetically/topically, as well as philosophically. It continues to bear fruits such as this session, which I find are immediately comforting and useful, recalling the holistic utility I had in mind when I began the Vibratelepathos series in the first place.",

Here, two sections of different length have been extracted from the \"Karplus Garden\" and looped over one another for an hour. This audio was then sent to three different resampling systems, each with their own probability-based settings, to continuously resample and loop portions of the main loops, which are then filtered, modulated, delayed and panned in a configuration of hard left, hard right and stereo swapped. The resultant full mix is one that recalls 'A Topography of Will' in timbre and chordal profile, but is an entirely new piece of music.",

It considers one of many paradoxes in the creative act - the position of being both the expression of an idea and the recipient of that expression - which, through the proxy of a deliberately convoluted and imperceptibly detailed procedural working method, allows both perspectives to exist in the same moment. In thinking about this state, consciously, I am fascinated with the possibility of facilitating newer and more immediately relevant, or perhaps more honest (for lack of a better term), creative work, which can only exist when the bearer and the beholder are a singular entity in the same window of time.",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few. It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume Three of the Divergent Paths series collects the following eight sessions:\nPATHOS 17 - Pomonalia\nPATHOS 18 - Ornithic Limewash\nPATHOS 19 - Rusted Onyx Compass\nPATHOS 20 - A Distant Time\nPATHOS 21 - Mesolith\nPATHOS 22 - Mesolith II\nPATHOS 23 - Kinematic Initiatives II\nPATHOS 24 - Waterbearer II\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics.",

Somewhere in the distance, the sound of metal being dragged across stone echoes, punctuated occasionally by higher pitched whines and bowed resonation, wafting up from some smoking ravine we're lucky to not be able to see. This piece was primarily designed as a companion to re-reading Wayne Douglas Barlowe's unique and fascinating novel about Hell, \"God's Demon,\" and bears an optional disclaimer: RUSTED ONYX COMPASS may not be suitable for sleeping or meditation, and subscribers are encouraged to take this into consideration when listening.\nThis piece has also been mastered for lower level playback than the typical Vibra recording, and works best on headphones or playback within quieter physical spaces.",

                    "about": "Sometimes, accidents happen in the studio, especially during feverish moments of overwhelming inspiration, which can compromise or otherwise ruin a recording, and in some such cases, the discovery that this has taken place does not happen until after a lengthy session. The remnants of the botched recording session are usually shelved indefinitely, and labeled as such, in the hopes that someday, something useful may yet be done with them. The Vibratelepathos series (and general working methodology) was developed with the use of any recording source bearing any level of quality in mind, so it has become possible to retrieve damaged and forsaken recordings and reprocess them into something new and viable. Previous recordings published after going through such a transfiguration include Ornithic Limewash and Amethyst Extracts, though each of these recordings utilized a completely unique approach in order to shape them into something listenable and cogent.\nIn the case of Mesolith, two extended sessions were recorded with incorrect microphone sources, resulting in a badly rendered room recording of the sessions rather than a direct-line input recording from the mixing desk. Through careful use of parametric equalization and various low/high/bandpass filters, it was possible to extract all relevant tonal information from these otherwise unlistenable recordings, isolate it and reprocess it into the unexpectedly beautiful renderings you hear now.\nThese types of transfigurative approaches are perfectly illustrative of the truly malleable properties of sound, considered as matter, and fully able to be renewed and revised at the molecular level by the R-EW Audioholistics modular system and processing path. Not only do their manifestations represent the successful meeting of incidental challenges that often crop up in studio work of any kind, but they also bring to mind the thought that in sound, it is possible to declare that no laws are ever fixed, that Mesolith and other sessions like it exist peripherally alongside any given recording that manifests in the studio, merely waiting for the right time and place to become observable. The thinking that any sound may be and may also become any other sound, at any point in the duration of that sound's runtime, and given the right tools and working order, that such pursuits are not only possible, but relatively simple and wholly obtainable.",

                    "about": "Sometimes, accidents happen in the studio, especially during feverish moments of overwhelming inspiration, which can compromise or otherwise ruin a recording, and in some such cases, the discovery that this has taken place does not happen until after a lengthy session. The remnants of the botched recording session are usually shelved indefinitely, and labeled as such, in the hopes that someday, something useful may yet be done with them. The Vibratelepathos series (and general working methodology) was developed with the use of any recording source bearing any level of quality in mind, so it has become possible to retrieve damaged and forsaken recordings and reprocess them into something new and viable. Previous recordings published after going through such a transfiguration include Ornithic Limewash and Amethyst Extracts, though each of these recordings utilized a completely unique approach in order to shape them into something listenable and cogent.\nIn the case of Mesolith, two extended sessions were recorded with incorrect microphone sources, resulting in a badly rendered room recording of the sessions rather than a direct-line input recording from the mixing desk. Through careful use of parametric equalization and various low/high/bandpass filters, it was possible to extract all relevant tonal information from these otherwise unlistenable recordings, isolate it and reprocess it into the unexpectedly beautiful renderings you hear now.\nThese types of transfigurative approaches are perfectly illustrative of the truly malleable properties of sound, considered as matter, and fully able to be renewed and revised at the molecular level by the R-EW Audioholistics modular system and processing path. Not only do their manifestations represent the successful meeting of incidental challenges that often crop up in studio work of any kind, but they also bring to mind the thought that in sound, it is possible to declare that no laws are ever fixed, that Mesolith and other sessions like it exist peripherally alongside any given recording that manifests in the studio, merely waiting for the right time and place to become observable. The thinking that any sound may be and may also become any other sound, at any point in the duration of that sound's runtime, and given the right tools and working order, that such pursuits are not only possible, but relatively simple and wholly obtainable.",

Within this framework, each LFO is independently tuned from the others, to form interesting harmonic layers presented as a massive, multi-voiced chord. This second volume of such recordings was recorded on September 20, 2021, and offers a much more musical profile than the more drone-oriented first session.\nAll worlds, all times.",

A beautiful example of the versatility of the Audioholistics system, with both Waterbearer sessions remaining personal favorites of mine, offering a view of how disciplined sound synthesis can return gorgeous and musical results in addition to utilitarian listening tools. This second session has remained in stasis for quite some time, having been recorded as far back as December 2020, kept hidden away for many nights of respite and relief from the brutality of the world clawing at my walls. Springtime is a season of renewal, and so it feels apt to finally share it with the wider world. I hope you find as much comfort in these filtered soundwaves as much as I have.",

            "about": "Divergent Paths collects ambient and generative recording sessions that were previously issued exclusively to subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ) in box sets of eight sessions each. These sessions notably exist outside of the 'main' Vibra catalog, usually due to their origins as more unique or esoteric studio processes, sometimes involving the repurposing/reprocessing of outtakes or even damaged recordings that could not be otherwise released. The self-oscillating nature of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system makes many new things possible for audio that would otherwise be discarded, and Divergent Paths capitalizes fully upon this fact by providing a catalog dedicated solely to these peripheries.\nDivergent Paths sessions are in no way considered to be lesser, or weirder, or more inaccessible than the Vibra series recordings - in truth, many of my favorite modular recordings to date reside within this series, such as 'Roman Fountains', 'Waterbearer' and 'Mesolith' to name a few. It is for this reason I've decided now to offer these recordings to the general public, after they have enjoyed over two years in the shade of exclusivity, although their pricing here, in these eight-part collections, is more indicative of their runtimes and the box sets themselves.\nAll Divergent Paths sessions (noted by their PATHOS ## catalog designations) remain available to all new and existing subscribers of the Vibratelepathos series, at any subscription tier, and it is my sincere hope that this material is able to reach as many people as possible, whether it is a digital exclusive in a subscription service or a more formalized physical collection such as this, as the entirety of my Vibra session work is driven by a desire to facilitate healthy and pleasurable escapism through the medium of sound, as an aid to sleeping, meditation, creative work, substance-led and substance-free gnostic states and even more intimate applications.\nVolume Two of the Divergent Paths series collects the following eight sessions:\nPATHOS 9 - Waterbearer\nPATHOS 10 - Measured Air\nPATHOS 11 - Measured Air II\nPATHOS 12 - Measured Air III\nPATHOS 13 - Ornate Coral Reliquaries\nPATHOS 14 - Ruined Canyon Ossuary\nPATHOS 15 - Sangean Sea\nPATHOS 16 - Sangean Sea II\nInformation about each individual session may be found in the track details section of each piece, for those interested. These notes include contextual details about where and when the pieces were recorded, patch notes and other relevant specifics.",

It was generated using the Roland SH-32 polyphonic digital synthesizer in tandem with the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, and was initially only a test session for a possible online broadcast. It appears here as a lush reprise of the more melodic and dynamic Vision Chronograph recordings, and should be considered supplemental to those.",

The cassette contained processed sections of vinyl records, minimal electric guitar feedback, vocal experiments and sustained tones from a vintage Heathkit AO-1 oscillator. The tape was played back via a Vesta Fire MR-10B multitrack machine, which allowed selective isolation of any of the four audio channels previously recorded, and this output was routed directly into the R-EW system to produce what you hear.",

                    "about": "RUINED CANYON OSSUARY was the second of two sessions undertaken in May of 2021, using the R-EW Audioholistics modular system to explore and transfigure audio from a four-track cassette, initially recorded in 2016 for the purpose of live performance audio-collage work. The cassette contained processed sections of vinyl records, minimal electric guitar feedback, vocal experiments and sustained tones from a vintage Heathkit AO-1 oscillator. The tape was played back via a Vesta Fire MR-10B multitrack machine, which allowed selective isolation of any of the four audio channels previously recorded, and this output was routed directly into the R-EW system to produce what you hear.",

            "about": "(This is SIDE A)\n'Dusk Maps' is, at its core, a session of recordings from January of 2021, which was focused on loop studies using the Casio MT-210 \"Pulse Code Modulation\" synthesizer in conjunction with a Boss RC-20 looper, a Peavey PVDJ Grabber and FX2 mixer with custom DSP FX. This session was enjoyable and plans were made for it to be released, but kept slipping away as things like Vibratelepathos took precedence. In the time since, I've attempted to revisit the material in overdubbing capacities, always ending up somewhere so far removed from the loops themselves that the original session remained unused once again.\nFinally, as Summer of '23 waned and gave way to a gorgeous quiet Autumn here in Ohio, I happened upon the perfect application/exploration of these recordings, using granular processors, fast Fourier transforms and other transformative means, allowing two distinct halves of a whole to emerge like flowers that have finally bloomed. They are warm, and sun-kissed, but not bathed in a Summer heat, and there is a subtle fluttering movement beneath their placid surfaces, which reminds me of the leaves trembling across the green grass as Autumn breezes through the valley.\nSo, 'Dusk Maps' arrives in two variations, which could be taken as volumes one and two, or sides A and B, but to my mind, they are more like 'NW Age' in how they both present a slightly different perspective on the same subject matter, reflecting each other at times, and augmenting each other at times. Topically speaking, these recordings would appeal to fans of 'cozy' minimal ambient albums such as 'Elide' and 'The Synthesist's Alphorn Retreat' while also recalling shades of my warm guitar stasis on SSR albums like 'The Loneliness of Empty Roads' or EPs from the 21MG Series, even though they are not guitar music, or organ music, while somehow timbrally resembling both in different moments.\nHowever you approach these recordings, I hope they offer an easy and accessible listening experience that isn't really concerned with anything in particular - a pleasant sense of being still, inert and emptied. There is a lot of movement and overwhelming information in the world today, and my 'Dusk Maps' are something that may offer some shelter. Please be well, take care of yourselves, and remember to slow down and rest.",

They are warm, and sun-kissed, but not bathed in a Summer heat, and there is a subtle fluttering movement beneath their placid surfaces, which reminds me of the leaves trembling across the green grass as Autumn breezes through the valley.\nSo, 'Dusk Maps' arrives in two variations, which could be taken as volumes one and two, or sides A and B, but to my mind, they are more like 'NW Age' in how they both present a slightly different perspective on the same subject matter, reflecting each other at times, and augmenting each other at times. Topically speaking, these recordings would appeal to fans of 'cozy' minimal ambient albums such as 'Elide' and 'The Synthesist's Alphorn Retreat' while also recalling shades of my warm guitar stasis on SSR albums like 'The Loneliness of Empty Roads' or EPs from the 21MG Series, even though they are not guitar music, or organ music, while somehow timbrally resembling both in different moments.\nHowever you approach these recordings, I hope they offer an easy and accessible listening experience that isn't really concerned with anything in particular - a pleasant sense of being still, inert and emptied. There is a lot of movement and overwhelming information in the world today, and my 'Dusk Maps' are something that may offer some shelter. Please be well, take care of yourselves, and remember to slow down and rest.",

            "about": "Echo Spectrum and Boulevard Haze, both taken from the New Drugs album, were originally issued on this double-single set (backed by eight b-sides) in 2007, a few months ahead of the album. As such, this release is a sort of sister to New Drugs, containing several tracks that didn't make the cut but remain fan favorites today (see: Pinwheel Carousels, Bicycle Day). It is only appropriate then, that Echo Spectrum finally gets the same expanded reissue and remaster treatment as New Drugs, which is what I'm happy to present you with here. Accompanying the original ten tracks are eight others from various locations: Albatrosses / Counting Lights from Calico Fountain Melange, Solar Window / Night Flight / Lab Version of Plume Train from Muted Travels and Hi Teens from Bent Appletrees 2 - a track I always regretted not including on a proper album somewhere. Closing the set is the previously unreleased vignette piece, Charlotte Space, which was originally recorded for Muted Travels but had to be left off for time constraints. There is also a small artifact from Germany included here, for your chuckling pleasure.",
            "credits": "released July 6, 2016\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at 114RKD, 2006-2007. Mastered by The Analog Botanist, Botany Bay, 2016. This is Milieu Music number AD26, and 26th in the Arboreal Digest reissue catalog.",

            "about": "Originating during the frenzied months of session work for 2023's \"Watch the Head\" album, the piece of procedurally arranged ambient music that would become the end of that album arrived in a longer duration than the closing slot could afford. A modest 5-minute edit was made for that purpose, and the full arrangement of \"Echogee\" was set aside with an eventual separate release later on. 2024 came and went, and with both the 20th anniversary celebrations for Milieu (which included the expansive triple-disc \"Butcher Block Andromeda II\" retrospective and the 200+ page \"Knows No Bounds\" paperback book) and the continuous session work for Coppice Halifax's \"Mountain Interval,\" the planned expansion of \"Echogee\" didn't fully materialize until now, in the cold and wet Spring season of a pretty miserable 2025 year.\nAs many people who know me would tell you, I am often discussing how little I am interested in rushing or pushing things along with unnatural schedules in my creative work. Things happen only if and when they are meant to happen, and so \"Echogee\" has arrived at a moment that I didn't think it would, but it feels more considered and practical now, to have something so pretty and introspective be released during a truly nightmarish moment in American history. Ornate and comforting modes of escapism are not just useful during times of great stress and strain, but essential, and so it feels good to have something like \"Echogee\" in my archives just waiting to become a beam of warm sunlight in a dim and cold era.\nThere is not much else to write or say about \"Echogee,\" that the sound of the recordings cannot more efficiently convey. It is ambient music as I have made in the past, nothing entirely new or groundbreaking, but not so much a genre exercise as it was/is an attempt to revisit a very \"classical\" ambient compositional framework, as the inimitable Eno laid out decades ago. \"Echogee\" consists of several different synthesizer voices, each held to a minimum of contributions - sometimes two chords or a two-or-three note melodic motif, but usually just one note - and these parts are all allowed to come and go in their own time, independent of each other, but compositionally arranged to be mindful of overlapping with one another in any combination. This sort of procedural music making has never failed to interest and fascinate me, and learning to write music like this has led me toward so many other tools and approaches, from tape assemblages and live looping improvisations with guitar and organ, to modular music and all manner of unorthodox methods of sequencing and modulating.\nAnd yet, despite all of these varied systems and methods of working, my music has not entirely changed, and this is probably a positive thing, since you are most likely reading this passage as someone who has been here with me before, perhaps returning in the hopes of finding another warm wooden hollow, another blue rainbow arcing over this green valley. \"Echogee\" proves that despite the path winding through different seasons and landscapes, we always manage to find each other again, never quite remembering or forgetting how it happened before. I'm happy to still be here with you, trying to find a way, and I hope you'll relax a while, and just listen to the wind blowing through the leaves with me.",

            "about": "Elide is a somewhat unexpected ambient Milieu album, which resides somewhere between the recent Ambell Suns release (which transfigured melodies from Bell'n Dither into sad ambient microforests) and the upcoming Statuettes Part Two album, recorded years ago and scheduled for a release at ROHS in Berlin. It collects a series of isolated shorter sessions, undertaken throughout the Autumn and Winter seasons of 2017/2018, which use sampled bells, thumb pianos and various tonal percussion elements alongside analog synthesizers and outboard processors. All of this is gently hushed along like leaves in a valley breeze, through soft field recordings and manipulated radio static. Music for dreaming about Summer in the colder parts of the year, inspired by things such as GAS, Purl, Arjen Schat and the usual suspects such as SAW II, Variant, Irv Teibel's Environments and Wendy Carlos' Sonic Seasonings.",

            "about": "\"Aye! I am a poet and upon my tomb\nShall maidens scatter rose leaves\nAnd men myrtles, ere the night\nSlays day with her dark sword.\n'Lo ! this thing is not mine\nNor thine to hinder,\nFor the custom is full old,\nAnd here in Nineveh have I beheld\nMany a singer pass and take his place\nIn those dim halls where no man troubleth\nHis sleep or song.\nAnd many a one hath sung his songs\nMore craftily, more subtle-souled than I;\nAnd many a one now doth surpass\nMy wave-worn beauty with his wind of flowers,\nYet am I poet, and upon my tomb\nShall all men scatter rose leaves\nEre the night slay light\nWith her blue sword.\n‘It is not, Raana, that my song rings highest\nOr more sweet in tone than any, but that I\nAm here a Poet, that doth drink of life\nAs lesser men drink wine.'\"\n-Ezra Pound, 'And Thus in Nineveh' (1908)\n---\n\"Enfleurage Septet\" is the 27th Sleepbuilding broadcast to be published for free online. It was originally streamed live on August 18th, 2023, and it is my very first session with Behringer's remake of ARP's Solina String Ensemble synthesizer. Sequencing was done in the Dorian scale (this changed to the major pentatonic scale for Part 5) with Arturia's Keystep Pro, and additional signal processing was facilitated by the R-EW Audioholistics modular system.\n2024, as a year, has felt like yet another ocean of extremes - in everything from weather to politics - and within that kind of an atmosphere, I've needed to run for shelter more often than not. It has become essentially important for me to make the time to step outside when there is a sunny day, to turn off the faucet of constant negative information that the internet provides, in order to remind myself - multiple times a day, on particularly hard days - that I am lucky to be far away from those things. Perhaps not very far away, but far enough away that I have a grassy yard that is warmed by a golden sun in a picturesque blue sky, and I can sit there and marvel at that distance.\nDistance that is necessary, for my own mental and physical well-being. \"Enfleurage Septet\" is this and only this - a form of distance between myself and the so-called real world, something to keep the clouds at arm's length while I focus on my work, my family, my friends. There isn't anything particularly profound or novel about it - it resembles in many ways a number of prior Sleepbuilding recordings - but I've come to appreciate things that are comfortable in their predictability, and I hope that you can appreciate these things in any way at all that is similar to how I see them. Thank you for being here, for listening, for being yourself.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE): campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "FROM THE AUTHOR, SUMMER 2021:\nFifteen varied, colorful and sometimes off-kilter tracks from the H IS FOR HOLOGRAM sessions, arguably sharing their concepts of space with Pink Space, and offering a lighter listening experience to accompany the main affair. Desserts and a digestif, following a cosmically exhausting jaunt across the galaxy.\nOriginally outtakes from H IS FOR HOLOGRAM, the tracks on ENJOY YOUR STAY have been lovingly remastered from their point of origin, covered in digital dust, now cleaned up with the tools of the future to provide a more robust and detailed playthrough. Here, ten years later, ENJOY YOUR STAY also receives a renewed design by Atoll Intercom Systems, matching the accompanying HOLOGRAM/SLEEP reinstatements, with some fresh new fantasist copy included on the CD edition as well.\nSeasoned Milieu fans as well as science-fiction geeks will recognize many of the references made here to books, television shows, video games and films, although the music itself should offer enough diversion with or without these topical connections. ENJOY YOUR STAY contains a wealth of bedroom electronics and space-age grooves, seemingly conjured via a starship radio operator, fumbling the dial through the bands in search of a station to refuel at.\nORIGINAL COPY, 2011:\nSo 2011 is ending, and you're sitting in your DeLorean thinking \"What about the future?\"...just then, a blinding flash of light slightly stuns you as Ace Rimmer appears in a sparkly clean space-suit with Berlin playing in the background. He hands you a small square disk not unlike the outmoded floppies PCs used in the 80's and 90's. This one has \"Get your ass to Mars\" scribbled on it with a smiley face giving a thumbs up. Before you can ask what it's for, Ace is gone, leaving only the faintest space-dust trail behind his rocket. You pull out your communicator to call Doc Brown, he'd probably know what to do with this disk. Upon arriving at Doc's lab, he knowingly inserts the disk into his Pip-Boy 7000 and decodes the data, which is revealed to be a 15-part message detailing the location of a swank holographic lounge, somewhere on the other side of the galaxy. After about a week of calculating Pi with Doc's fancy AI (conveniently named Holly) you know enough to build a transporter device to get you to the party just in time. A second blinding flash of light, and the feeling of being poured out of a bottle and into one of those tie-die machines...and suddenly you're naked and confused in the back of a smoky nightclub. You're approached by a silvery droid that asks \"Nice night for a walk?\" to which you reply \"Your clothes - give them to me, now\" and the robot kindly produces a red Starfleet uniform. Knowing what this means, you fear for your life until you open the door to the dancefloor and hear \"Last Night Ace Rimmer Saved My Life\" and realize all is as it should be. You make your way to the glowing neon bar and order a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster from the Asari Matriarch behind the counter. After a few sips, your vision blurs, blurs some more and before you know it you're cosmic surfing past Jupiter and well beyond the infinite. After the effect wears off you realize you just passed out on the Holodeck with a Ligeti record stuck in a locked groove. You tiredly walk over to the kiosk, take the LP off the turntable and curl up in the lovely soft bed sitting conveniently nearby. A tall dark monolith appears at the foot of the bed to say goodnight and turn the lights down. What a day. Next time you're totally going to Westworld instead.",

Expanding on the previous two-and-a-half hours of soundtrack with another full hour of deep and delicate Euflorian headspaces. Ambient, but not without a pulse. Melodic in the way that winding tree branches organically grow outward and upward. Organic and alive.",

Eufloria, and its soundtrack, has once again evolved to appear on the Apple iPad format, boasting new features, updated design and of course another 40 minutes of new Milieu sonic illustrations. This unexpected addendum to the already huge Eufloria soundtrack has been lovingly designed to fit alongside the previous volume of Euflorian Additions (MMD018), presented in a high-gloss mini-LP style CD sleeve with images from the game, and limited to 100 copies worldwide.",

            "about": "What is repetition? What is divergent? How can you tell?\nAs time passes, my perspective changes, as does the landscape before me, everything in constant motion, together and apart. This duality that seems so obvious, and yet confounds me continually, surrounds and contains all things. I am a part of this arrangement, and everything I could ever say or do is too.\nSo here is something else, perhaps comforting and perhaps not. A composition that is both repetitious and completely serialized. A set of soundwaves that animate and yet do not proceed to anywhere beyond where they already are. Designed meticulously across two days of patching expressly for Milieu's twentieth anniversary party's afterparty, to both draw a line in the sand and relax beside it.\nWhat you hear that resembles bassoon, oboe or clarinet perhaps is actually two different wavetables within Synthesis Technology's E352 Cloud Terrarium, themselves sourced from different synthesizers of the past. These wavetables have been doubly filtered via a Buchla Quad Lo-Pass Gate and low-pass filters from Doepfer and 2HP, before being routed through an extensive FX array, which includes two instances of Mutable Instruments' Clouds alongside Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay and Starlab reverberator. The voices are playing a simple major pentatonic scale, albeit one continuously varied by Euclidean trigger sequences and a Turing machine that determines the octaval range and sustain of each note in the scale.\nEverything in motion, everything remaining in a sustained state of continuous flux. Are you, the listener, the constant in the equation? Or have you already changed as well? On and on, the soundwaves peal outward across the surrealistic landscape of red yellow blue and green, and almost everything else between, and there may never be an answer.",

            "about": "\"See\nhow they trace,\nacross the very-marble\nof this place,\nbright sevens and printed fours,\nelevens and careful eights,\nabracadabra\nof a mystic's lore\nor symbol\noutlined\non a wizard's gate.\"\n-H.D., excerpt from \"Birds in Snow\" (1928)\n---\n\"Five Birds\" is the thirty-seventh Sleepbuilding release, an overnight modular session that was originally broadcast live on 15th September 2024. It consists of an extensive study of 2HP's Bell, a polyphonic modal synthesizer, being continuously re-sampled in two granular samplers, which play two different sequences in the C# Lydian scale. Augmenting this sound is the Strymon Magneto four-head tape delay system, with multiple low-pass filters and gates from Doepfer, Buchla and 2HP themselves shaping the timbre. Complex modulation was derived from NLC Triple Sloths and the Buchla Source of Uncertainty.\nMusically, it sounds a bit like what I always hoped Cylob's \"Mood Bells\" album might have sounded like. I remember reading about the album, about Jeffs traveling to Asia and returning to England with a number of bell instruments, and using them in his studio to make something new and unheard of, and while I have since warmed to that album a lot, and enjoy it on its own merits, there was always the remnant in my mind, of the *idea* of \"Mood Bells,\" and I have pursued music in that thought process for many years now - \"Five Birds\" is only the most recent, although it is probably notable for being the longest.\n\"Five Birds\" is a deep listening extension of other recent Milieu sessions with Bell, such as the Vibratelepathos subscription-exclusives \"Change Ringing\" in two volumes, but it is also many times over a Sleepbuilding session, in the sense of what that might now entail - something long, nondescript enough to just color the room, but pretty and ornate and ever-changing enough that you can lean into it when you hear a nice melodic change or a passage that strikes you in the right moment, and it rewards both modes of listening. It may also be the closest thing to actual wind chimes I have produced, despite the amount of patching and shaping that went into it - it always strikes me as sort of funny to think about these minimalist recordings, being sourced from an absolute rat's nest of wires, lights and electricity, a total about-face from the very naturalistic tonalities that \"Five Birds\" indicates on its surface. These river waters, I have learned again and again, are as shallow or as deep as I desire them to be, and sometimes, like most things, they are both in the same moment.\n---\nA convenient list of all 37 FREE Sleepbuilding releases can be found at:  milieu-music.com/sleepbuilding/",

            "about": "'Five Glass Temples' collects modest edits of the first five published 'Glass Temple' sessions in the Vibratelepathos catalog. These pieces were recorded on various dates, ranging from January 2021 to Autumn 2023, but all of them have been composed and generated with the same machine, using the same methodology.\nThat machine is the perennially unique Arturia Microfreak, a four-voice paraphonic digital synthesizer with an analog filter, a digital patching matrix and a varied pool of available voices and operational modes. Among those, I have spent a considerable amount of time building what I have labeled \"Genergan\" patches in shorthand - generative organ configurations, designed so that one only need to pick a single starting key on the keyboard, and the Genergan will do the rest.\nThese patches generally rely on very slow modulation to move between two or three chordal forms, sourced from novel waveform envelopes that behave somewhat like a traditional sample and hold, but do not change quite as much. This results in the sound of a languorous organist, perhaps hesitant in the hand's next movement, feeling his way through a piece timbrally rather than melodically. The \"Glass\" in the session header assigned to these recordings is a nod to Philip Glass, whose work was a big influence on my listening mind in formative years, especially with the organ.\n'Glass Temple' sessions have unexpectedly become some of my favorite sessions in my Vibratelepathos catalog, and are frequently mentioned in conversations with others who follow the series, and so when my printer drew some interesting gaps in the \"faceplate\" design for the Vibratelepathos box set, due to an error, it struck me in such a way that I thought it would be an opportune moment to assemble some of my favorite sessions and use this accidental \"design\" as a vehicle for a sampler of those recordings. Between the surrealistic arches in the print gaps, perhaps resembling a structure outlined on a landscape with a bursting sun behind it, and my fondness for the Genergan sessions, 'Glass Temple' was an easy choice.\nI hope you enjoy the five excerpts I've plotted out here as much as I have. They each derive from a much longer work - the third one runs for over five hours alone - but I also feel they constitute a coherent album when presented in this way, and perhaps offer an accessible entry point to the now 81 sessions deep Vibra catalog, for a newcomer.\n\"Go then - there are other worlds than these\"\n---\nN.B. Interested parties wishing to investigate the wellspring of the Vibratelepathos series that these sessions originated from would be advised to visit  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  where monthly subscriptions are available, as well as individual sessions for public purchase. Subscriptions include immediate access to an exclusive \"hidden\" catalog of work that at this moment contains almost fifty unique releases, and also offer a reusable discount on any back-catalog session purchases the subscriber should wish to make.",

            "about": "\"Hear this our song,\naccept our leaves,\nlove-offering,\nreturn our hymn,\nlike echo fling\na sweet song,\nanswering note for note.\"\n-H.D., excerpt from 'Holy Satyr' (1922)\n---\n'Focussed Light' is the 24th Sleepbuilding session to be published for free, originally broadcast on the evening of May 22nd, 2023. It is adjacent to the 'Apennine Hashish' sessions in the Vibratelepathos series in that it uses the same voice - the 3340 \"Curtis chip\" analog oscillator - although it diverges from those sessions in its exploration of the microtonal 5-HD2 scale (or five-step harmonic series scale). It was also the very first session to use the Strymon Starlab, a powerful multifaceted reverberation machine.\nInitially, 'Focussed Light' may seem melodically different than most other Sleepbuilding streams, but after a little time passes, the unorthodox tuning is normalized, and the emotive qualities of the music become more apparent. I often find this to be the case with a lot of the microtonal music I listen to, where the element of time is arguably more important than other aspects of the composition, because it allows the ear to adjust to newer pitch relationships and timbral differences.\nThis music felt appropriate to revisit for this release, personally, because of several conversations I've had in various correspondence about purpose-led work versus progress-led work - the notion that development of art should happen simply for its own sake, in the vague pursuit of newness, rather than being created to address specific needs or curiosities. It came to my attention in these conversations that my work could be easily interpreted by others as belonging to the former category, given the sheer amount of recordings I've published, but I tend to disagree with this interpretation.\n'Focussed Light' is an apt example of my feeling that anything I create, or facilitate the creation of, has been designed with a given purpose in mind, whether it was something highly specific, such as this example of writing melodic music within an unconventional system of temperament, or something more broad, such as the desire to offer a method of holistic escapism for free to the internet-accessible world.\nI do not believe that randomness exists - only extremely complex systems whose chaos cannot be discerned in reasonable lengths of time - and following this, no creative act can ever be random either. Nothing can be free of calculation or decision, not truly - only at a topical and conscious level can we, as humans, find ways to act and express ourselves with only impulses - at a deeper level of consideration (and Sleepbuilding sessions such as this one highlight this point) it becomes increasingly apparent that all of my creative work is a decisive and directed act, and I have only momentarily managed to convince my self-awareness that it is not.\nSo, not only do I believe that art cannot be divorced from intent, but I also tend to feel that the notion of striving for progress and growth simply because you have the time and space and resources to do so is foolish. How bored must we admit that we are, when we feel compelled to surround ourselves with objects that do not yet hold any real meaning? The natural world is filled with meaning, inherently, despite all outward implications that a tree is merely a tree, the sky is only the sky, but this is again like the unfamiliar scale playing throughout 'Focussed Light' - a design is present, a system that functions according to directives, and the element of time is all we really need to discern the purpose and meaning of the things around us.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "The third and final part of the Transient Logics triptych, a privately commissioned work written and recorded for visual artist/designer David Hamlin that emerged as a Coppice Halifax album, a five-disc Milieu album (both bearing the same name) and this four-disc album. Forest Idyl consists of ten ambient compositions in what is now thought of as the \"old style\" of ambient Milieu recordings - swooning synthesizer chords, pedal bass underpinning and cloudy clusters of lead melodies weaving in and out above that landscape.\nThere isn't much more to say about Forest Idyl that the recordings themselves cannot. It was a developmental phase between ideas that ended up leading to what became the final Transient Logics album, but where Logics is a more psychedelic experience that travels through all seasons and temperatures, Forest Idyl is rooted firmly in its own Autumnal shades, nostalgic for sunny childhood days spent relaxing in the green grass at Brookgreen Gardens. I don't think I ever spent more time anywhere else besides the Horry County Memorial Library as a kid, and both of those places almost entirely informed my understanding of the artistic world. That I am only now referencing Brookgreen so overtly in one of my albums feels a little surprising, considering this. I clearly owe Anna Huntington quite a lot for Milieu existing at all.\nSo I'm pleased to issue this Autumnal trip through ambient blues, bearing the notable catalog number of 114 and now synergistically published on the fourth day of the eleventh month, where it feels that it is meant to exist. Special thanks are again due to David Hamlin, who only ever asked me to make him one album, and not ten, but that he asked at all is the entire reason these recordings found their way into the world to begin with. When I turned in all of this music at the conclusion of the commission, David was struck particularly by the title \"An Arrow Tracing an Arch\" and its resemblance to a piece of art he'd made prior, which he then offered to me for the album cover. It's a beautiful piece of visual work that I think connects to a lot of the ideas at play in the music, and again feels just a little bit like predestination in some way, or maybe the sense that we've been here before and have simply forgotten.",

            "about": "From four different sessions held in the pregnant space between Winter and Spring, comes a Milieu album that I was writing without even being aware I was doing it. As the snow melted under sunny warmth earlier in the 2019 year, and the green sprouts and flowers began to appear silently around the valley, I recorded four separate pieces, each as its own session, with four different pieces of hardware.\nThe first, \"Faun & Tin Bell\", was performed using only the Korg Volca Keys polyphonic analog synthesizer, through a number of analog and digital reverberation units. \"Shimmer In Two Pitches\" was created similarly using the Korg Volca Modular analog synthesizer, layering itself using a Digitech WH-4 and some well-placed analog delays. \"Belle Under Blue Light\" was created using a Korg Volca Sample, playing back several different variants and sequences of a struck metal bowl I sampled, again through copious amounts of reverberation and some tape dubbing. The final piece, \"Sun Plinth Aboiteaux\" is a Boss RC-20 looper meditation on a carefully selected section of a Satie piece, sampled from vinyl and slowly brought into the fullness of the sunlight by way of nearly every reverb, delay, filter and pitch shifter I possess. All tracks were bounced to cassette tape in the end, allowing them to congeal that much further on this collected release.\nMusically, I felt that these four pieces held a commonality between them, some kind of abstracted expectation of a bountiful green Spring season, filled with visions of rolling hills, gentle rains, white stone columns and olive groves. An idyllic mythology that itself held a longing for ships on the sea, or candle-lit warmth in a forest cabin. In each passage, you can hear some aspect of Milieu as you have possibly heard it before, on some other album, in some other past life. Passages may have began as a collection of four disparate recordings, but assembled here, in this way, it feels much more like a successor to things like Beyond The Sea Lies The Stars, Phosphene Weather and some of the Sun-Day albums.\nNow that Spring has passed, and Summer itself begins to wane, I felt these four pieces were owed a place in my catalog, ready for the cool Summer evenings and even cooler Autumn days, soon to come.",

            "about": "Foxhill Pastels collects the 2005 EPs Simple Stations Repeat and Giants In The Desert, both recorded at Foxhill, deep in the Columbian country. In many ways, these twenty tracks are emblematic of early period Milieu in ways none of the albums are - they are overly melodic, naively filled with weird dialogue samples and detuned to the point of near-nausea. Many of the tracks have since become associated with specific people and events, such as Ten and Tracer detailing a romantic mountain hike with wine, \"Walking Pastels\" and his girlfriend, or Eric Lee confessing that \"My Shiny Sunday\" is still his all-time favorite Milieu track. There are obvious references to the things I was emulating at that point in time - Freescha, Boards of Canada, Am-Boy, Ten and Tracer. Everything feels very off the cuff to me, listening to it now, which is perhaps owed somewhat to the fact that both EPs were created in under a week for two different online release events called Project 168. For completion's sake, I've also included the live version of \"Dream From Above Houses\", from Brother, which was remodelled for a live performance in Cayce, in February 2006. It is an appropriate segue between the more traditional Milieu of Simple Stations Repeat and the textural, dusky ambient weirdness that is Giants In The Desert. The two EPs are almost miniature mirror images of Aurora Borealis and Night Currents, the day and night brother-sister albums that would follow at U-Cover later in 2005 and 2006, making this set a fascinating little curio. For this collection, I've remastered Simple Stations Repeat from the original master tracks, but I've chosen to leave Giants In The Desert undisturbed, mostly because it's such a texturally specific suite of work and I'm honestly surprised at how nice it still sounds to me now. Hopefully, you're able to enjoy this little jaunt down that country dirt road as much as I have.",

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe eighth volume, FROZEN RAIN PATCHWORK, was broadcast live to the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club via Twitch on February 5, 2018. The Workshop had closed me in that night, surrounded by freezing rain and icy streets, giving me the urge to make something comfortable, easy and accessible. The result was 48-minute set of spacious and melodic braindance, with moments of sequencer-ambient, acid spasms and house grooves. Conjured completely using Korg Volca Bass/Keys/Sample/Beats, Korg MS-20, Yamaha RY-20, Boss DR-660, Roland TR-505 and Arturia Microbrute, channeled thru the usual FX devices and the trusty \"King Stevie\" Peavey mixer. Nothing you haven't really heard before from Milieu, but that wasn't the point. F.R.P. is a cozy and familiar bedroom party on new and old hardware, singing and dancing in MIDI-unison...perfect for a day when you need to lock yourself inside.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",

            "about": "GARLIND, a new Milieu ambient pastorale for the 2020 holiday season, available as a name-your-price download for the rest of this horrific year. I have not released any new holiday-themed Milieu since the SNOWRADIUS triple-album three years ago, and although GARLIND was a conceived idea on paper back then, it took a few more Christmases before I got the formula right.\nWhat you're hearing when you press play is the vocal coda from \"Merry Christmas Darling\" by The Carpenters, processed live through my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, augmented only by a two-note sinewave bassline generated with a self-oscillating SSDP Jade Series phaser, sequenced on an Arturia Keystep Pro. The session was broadcast live on my Twitch channel just a few days ago, and after a careful mastering job and the application of a field recording detailing wind through leafless trees, GARLIND is finally ready to be published.\nWhy sample The Carpenters, you ask? Well, as a kid, my father had one or two homemade mixtapes of Christmas music that he'd assembled via dubbing them on the fly from WKZQ, the FM station we listened to a lot in Myrtle Beach through the 1980s and 1990s. One of these tapes contained a transitional moment before a track, where the vocal coda of \"Merry Christmas Darling\" was left intact before playing the track he wrote on the tape label, and for this reason, my nostalgia in and of Christmastime is directly connected to those few seconds of close vocal harmony. I've wanted to find a way to expand this sample at the molecular level for years, to canonize it within my own creative landscape, and now I feel that I have finally been able to realize it properly after spending the entire year building a modular synthesizer system.\nYou might also listen to this and find yourself wondering why it seems as dark as it is? GARLIND, for me, bottles up all of the frustration and depression of carrying on with Christmas amid a global pandemic, a shitshow election and all kinds of other local/national/global problems, and attempts to make sense of it using the voice (and likeness) of Karen Carpenter, a neutral and time-separated sample of childhood nostalgia, a counterweight of positivity, optimism and pure youthful exuberance. Somewhere in there, the dark Winter of 2020 can be brightly lit by the hopeful warmth of a new year, and if my music can be another voice in that choir of empathy, forgiveness, charity and humility, I am happy to provide it.\nNOTE: This and all other holiday-themed releases I've done are FREE/NAME YOUR PRICE for the rest of 2020. Here is a handy list of all of them:\nmilieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/swirling-tinsel-singalongs\nmilieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/snowradius\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/soft-shelter\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/blue-vale-snowdream\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape-ii\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape-iii",

            "about": "While recording GARLIND during the holiday season of 2020, numerous variations and precursory alternatives were recorded and discarded as rehearsals prior to arriving at the final live broadcast and recording. I've toyed with the idea of issuing some of this embryonic material as another Xmas gift, for most of the year, eventually deciding to use it in a more transfigurative way and create a newer piece of music, with the GARLIND session materials providing only half of the new body as composted sound. What manifested from these efforts sits before you now, somewhere between a remix, a rehearsal and a reprise, but also none of those things - perhaps it is best to consider this recording as GARLIND plucked from a parallel universe, the same but different. In any case, and however you choose to listen to it, if you listen to it at all, GARLIND is hopefully exactly what it says on the tin: A post-chordal wall of Wintery blanket and introspective disconnection.\nHappy holidays to everyone celebrating, and even to those who are not. Long life, good health and many happy returns in 2022.\nAs is my usual custom for this season, all of my holiday-related recordings are currently name-yr-price, and you can find all of them at the links below:\nmilieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/garlind\nmilieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/icepak\nmilieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/swirling-tinsel-singalongs\nmilieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/snowradius\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/soft-shelter\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape-ii\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape-iii\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/blue-vale-snowdream",

            "about": "Arriving fashionably late is GERMS 86, the second single for/from the SHALLOW EARTH album issued at Recycled Plastics. To make up for the delinquency, Germs 86 has been augmented by five more tracks than it was previously intended to carry, making it a full 40+ minute mini-LP - a digestif for the Shallow Earth experience.\nLeading the fray is a Night Version of Germs 86, which may not sound too different to most ears - what is happening here is a re-pitching and processing of the Illuminated Paths \"Party Mix\" version of the track, which was itself much slower in tempo and pitch, and saturated via multiple generations of tape. Thus, in \"returning\" Germs 86 to its former state (or something close to it) it becomes like a mostly-remembered party that you absentmindedly wonder about the next morning. From there, He Can C cuts apart a Phil Collins single and gleefully rearranges it over a rubbery drum machine, before obliterating the entire mix in a fluorescent chemical fog and evaporating it. Hallex Video offers a 2-minute palate cleanser with a lock-groove of that soul LP you like to play when you separate the seeds from the stems. The iconic Love Theme from the romantic comedy 'Cosine Pharmacy' appears next, with some reflective dialogue between star-cross'd lovers Jean and Patrick, as they enjoy a sorbet on the balcony of Patrick's posh apartment. Pink Pepper picks up the pace again with a reprise of Harlequin Salon from the Shallow Earth album, although the entirety of the original track has been stripped off and replaced, except for a distant wash of synthesizer chords. Androgen Welt, previously an exclusive bonus track given out to those who attended the Shallow Earth Listening Party on Twitch, manages to appear here as well, after some convincing. The final two cuts, Glanz and Ambsalons, dial the groove back down again to a warm ambient buzz.\n**As a small additional fun thing, I found three black cassette tapes in a box and decided to use them to make a tape edition of the two singles for Shallow Earth. This cassette, titled GLANZWELT, collects all eleven tracks from the AMBER PETROL'R aperitif and the GERMS 86 release presented here. The track sequence has been altered to give a more cassette-friendly flow, and the tapes are contained inside fluorescent green plastic cases with digital gradient photography on a glossy Fujicolor insert. Being that there are only two of these cassettes for public sale, they're a bit special, and they are being priced to raise a bit of extra cash to pay for more blank tapes to issue more tape editions on!",

            "about": "The second of three singles from the forthcoming SUN CAST album - a new Milieu record that has been in progress for the better part of eight years. Weathering hard drive crashes, studio changes, relocation and the birth of my daughter in that span of time, the material presented on Sun Cast is very much what one might call \"classic Milieu\" in that it returns to the subtropical Summer melodies, chopped break rhythmic nod, warm tanned basslines and a melancholic wistfulness that you can't quite put your finger on. A special record that will hopefully delight fans of albums like New Drugs and Swaying Palms, as well as Halifaxian works such as Ocean Lion and Pink Acre.\nGREEN HEAT is a track that sits on the fence between melodic Milieu sadness and Halifaxian \"Analog Botany\" style dub techno sway. While busier on the percussion side of things, it still manages to keep itself laid back, with a wooden synth-bass at the forefront and dub chord stabs washing in and out of the stereo field like bubbling waves. Somewhere in the midst of all this, a two-chord tremolo surfs in slowly as the rhythm dips under the surface of the water for a moment, kissing the mermaids and taking Polaroids of the warped faces above. Once the rhythm comes up for air, the track enters full-on Milieu melancholy mode, making the entire jam up to that point feel like a slow curtain pulling back to reveal a bleary-eyed sunset, laid over your tired sand-covered feet like a blanket.\nBacking Green Heat for the single are three outtakes from the SUN CAST sessions, themselves Summer-obsessed and ready for a drive.",

            "about": "Gunkajima was the first Milieu album recorded, and arguably it can be said that the Milieu name itself was chosen to fit with a record of this kind. Although it was created around the same time as Songs We Found In The Sand, the album bears no resemblance to any other Milieu music at the time, and would remain an anomaly until perhaps Giants In The Desert was recorded a full two years later.\nGunkajima is comprised of a seamless suite of five longform beatless pieces, themselves built out of carefully assembled field recordings, computer and tape recorded synthesis and instrumental improvisation. From these components, a foreboding atmosphere emerges, painting an abstract image of a deserted city landscape, decaying civilization overtaken by the elements (a theme that would be revisited later on several Coppice Halifax albums) and total abject isolation.\nGunkajima itself is such a place - an island off the coast of Japan that looks like a battleship from the mainland, completely deserted since 1974 (although it's worth noting that in my naivete back in 2004, I may have misspelled the proper name of the island on the album...even so, I don't have the heart to change it now). Having read about the island in a book, I was inspired to create an artificial field recording of the place, paired with imagery from a nightmare I had at the time (which, oddly, was somewhere in Bavaria in the early 1900s), and so this brooding experience was given life through a kitchen-sink recording approach in my then-girlfriend's living room.\nAt the time, it represented far more than the sum of its pieces, to me. It was the first time I'd really successfully created something totally unique on my own - I'd been in and out of several bands since 1997 and Gunkajima was my first recording project that was made using leftover equipment from those years. By today's standards, and on the other end of 400+ releases, it probably doesn't hold as much weight, but it's still the very beginning of this long strange trip I've been on since then, and as such will never lose significance for me.\nI've gone to great exhaustive lengths to remaster the release, and I think it sounds and feels even bolder than it did when I created it. In continuing with my tradition of renewal and revision, after finding the source recordings, I set out to also create a new Coppice Halifax piece using those original sounds. The resulting piece is the hour-long Varosha, itself named for yet another abandoned city, and a perfect companion piece to the ominous landmark that is Gunkajima.",

            "about": "FROM THE AUTHOR, SUMMER 2021:\nH IS FOR HOLOGRAM has always held a special place in my memory - I remember vividly the tangential and sporadic sessions, in 2010 and 2011, initially spurred on by supplementary soundtrack work for an updated port of Eufloria on the Playstation Network, but quickly mutating into their own respective shapes. Longtime listeners already know very well my lifelong obsession with both science-fiction and science-fact, and it should be no surprise at all that the life of an electronic musician actually meets those two poles somewhere in the middle. HOLOGRAM is packed to the brim with references, both deep and topical, to all kinds of books, films, television shows and video games - there are too many to name here, but the wiki that is currently underway would be a good place to expand on those things. The music, at the time, was very much picking up where something like TIDEWATER PETROL had left off, although those recordings would sit unreleased until a full year after HOLOGRAM had already been issued (due to a number of conflicts and delays) despite being laid to tape in 2009. This is to say, HOLOGRAM is resplendent with bedroom electronic hallmarks - funky drum machine work, huge FM synth basses, futuristic pad chords and spaced-out lead melodies - accumulating into a very Milieu-sounding album, but using all sorts of glossy and plastic digital synthesis to accomplish it. After revisiting this material a decade later, and considerately remastering it from the original session tracks, I feel that HOLOGRAM is as fresh as ever, full of low-gravity bounce and surrealistic life, and these remasters could not have landed at a more opportune moment - the world still consumed by needless suffering, viruses decimating the population, rich assholes shooting themselves into space - HOLOGRAM has beamed down in the midst of a sunny Summer, ready to take you away for a starry-eyed vacation, without ever leaving your home...and boy oh boy, have we got a vacation for you.\nORIGINAL COPY, 2011:\nDialing in from several light-years away comes a new Milieu album that is just as suited for Summertime as it is for space travel. H Is For Hologram is the summation of several dozens of influences, mixing together like paint and chemicals to create funky fumes that will get you higher than the moon. Combining a braindance infused hybrid of melodic analog synths, organic drumlines and high-grav bass frequencies to build a living breathing robot that will navigate your cruiser to Magrathea, park it in the corner of a Heighliner and serve you blue liquor in a swanky intergalactic lounge on the more colorful side of the Neutral Zone. Packed with loads of hidden samples, dialogue and sound effects from several of my favorite sci-fi movies and TV shows, this album is limited to 50 copies packaged in teleporter-paper and custom stamped cardstock inserts. Don't smegging leave Earth without it!",

            "about": "\"Hold me in a field of molten flowers, take me to the ground.\"\n-F. Schneider, 1989\nIn what has come to be affectionately referred to as the 'Sleepbuilding' series, I offer you another twelve-hour pastorale of generative ambient music: 'Hold Me in a Field' was broadcast overnight on March 11th, 2023, and has now been dutifully cleaned up and mastered for publishing here.\n'Hold Me in a Field' was created using the Spectra mode oscillator within Noise Engineering's Versio module (running the alternative Multi Versio firmware), alongside a slew of filters, two granular processors and a digital tape delay unit with four heads. It conjured up images of flower fields and orange sun that was a bit too far away to really be that warm.\nSometimes I find that these overnight broadcasts bring a lot of ideas and considerations bubbling up to the surface of my awareness, and other times, I experience a pleasantly empty-headed feeling, somewhere between momentary contentment and a low-level drip of topical stimulation. 'Hold Me' is absolutely the latter, a comforting (force)field to be cradled within, where everything just feels cozy and pain seems very distant.\nI chose to issue this recording on Earth Day as well, owing to the aforementioned sensation of happy stasis, because every day seems to bring more doom and gloom in the news, a continually heightened awareness of the world not actually being very okay, and with this, a perpetual reminder that I can do very little about it. As my brain always tries to find a way to refute failure, to reactively push back against it to perhaps re-balance the scales when negative things happen, I return again and again to my self-care rituals such as the one that brought 'Hold Me in a Field' into existence. Music used as a holistic recovery method, with as much automation and as little fuss as possible in the making - that is all this is. Whatever I find inside its wide and shallow landscape as time passes is secondary, whatever it means to you is entirely canonical.\nHappy Earth Day - be well, be kind and try not to work too hard.\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):\nMMD071 (Creation)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/creation\nMMD072 (A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-small-fire-in-the-snowy-woods\nMMD073 (Cirrus)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/cirrus\nMMD074 (Zephyrean)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/zephyrean\nMMD075 (Chiasmus)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/chiasmus\nMMD076 (Relief Upon the Landscape)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/relief-upon-the-landscape\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

While this material has been painstakingly mastered to sound as nice as it possibly can, these recordings are raw and wild examples of Milieu in his natural setting, surrounded by gear, hands all over the mixer, in a cozy basement room lit only by the LEDs on the synthesizers and drum machines that are generating the realtime vibrations. A massive amount of music, annotated with dates and hardware configurations printed on the discs themselves, Houseworks is sure to both please, surprise and maybe even confound even the most dedicated Milieu listener.\nLimited to 10, so get in fast!",

            "about": "\"Surely there is something more in each of the trees,\nsome living soul.\nIn my soul I plainly heard the wood-spirit join the refrain,\nAs some old tree thrill’d with its soul:\nKnow I bear the soul befitting me,\nI too have consciousness, identity,\nAnd all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth.\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from 'Trees'\n'Imagining a Forest' is the tenth published overnight broadcast in the Sleepbuilding series of longform generative ambient sessions. It was streamed as it was composed on February 22nd 2023,\nThe further in I cut a path into my overgrown creative real estate, the more apparent it becomes that there must exist certain works that can act as beacons - well-lit gates of welcoming, easy to locate, open and unconditional in their acceptance.\nNot only do I feel obligated to build such functional structures, out of the basic need to share things that bring me to a state of happiness, but also because these open doors are a logistic necessity - realms of familiarity, pinpointed across the map, anchors of orientation.\n'Imagining a Forest' is one such work, one of several I could now name that, for my experiences with them, could be a lighthouse in a dark and stormy night on the coastline. It is both a dream hovering in the dim air above a sleeping automaton, and the machine itself, having the dream. It presumes nothing about us, voyeuristically listening in, while we wonder if we are a part of this dream ourselves. The machine is ambivalent, it continues on as it dissolves the lines in the air that separate the two worlds.\nIn this moment, which the machine emanates for twelve hours, nothing happens, and for that, I am in awe of the beauty of being comfortably inert. The machine has grown this massive forest from only a single branch, and so it is my doing to build a fire at its entrance, where we can all sit and gaze at the soft colors fluttering in the even softer breath of this surreal blue wood.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "It's taken me almost three years, but I've finally returned from my second long trek through Hyrule, following my solo polysynth travelogue on MMD044, and what better timing could I have than to arrive during the 35th anniversary of The Legend Of Zelda? Indeed, when exploring Hyrule's many delights and dangers, it is easy to forget that you are already a part of the land's rich histories. You, the one holding the controller.\nOn offer here are several impressionistic portraits of places, events, heroes and villains that all play a part, either great or small, in the diverse ecologies of Hyrule. Like the traveling minstrel Kass, my recordings conjure up images of sweet romance and silver bladed battle, magical blessings and lost castle curses, sacrifices and resurrections, vibrant wildlife and the black doom of death. Sunken kingdoms, spell-struck maidens, spirits full of longing, ghosts driven by vengeance...all of this, and more, are at the very foundations of Hyrule. Here before you are three circular tomes, not unlike the Sheikah Slate, that contain laser-etched music, wordless songs that will call you back to the green land and the blue lakewater, onward into the careening cliffs and their ruin-dotted mountainpeaks, and further still to the yellow-purple Gerudo desert and the lonesome shores of the Necluda sea.\nHere and now, by this small fire, we can relive these places and times together! How close they feel, just inside the threshold of those flames! Always alive in our minds, yet forever just out of reach. Soon enough, you and even I will be compelled to return, when these harp-strums fall flat in contrast to the hint of another adventure. For now, rest in this quaint village they call Tarrey Town, and revel in the sounds of the forever dreaming land of Hyrule.",

            "about": "I don't often mention how deeply my creative life is connected to video games, but every now and again it becomes a more relevant aspect of my recordings. Having recently finished the newest installment in the Zelda series - Breath Of The Wild - and logging around 300 hours in it, all told, I felt once again that I could actually stand in Hyrule Field and hear the birdsong, while rays of sunshine slowly dappled across the grass. The ages-old odyssey was beginning again...a hero, a villain, a princess, a castle and a sword...all existing in some imperceptible recursive loop. Breath Of The Wild is easily in the top ranks of my favorite Zelda games now, right next to Ocarina Of Time and Wind Waker. I've pulled influence from these games before, on the two guitar-centric splits I recorded with Millipede, but never until now have I addressed the shadow cast on my work as Milieu.\nWhile I was playing Breath Of The Wild, I'd take breaks to build patches and write sequences on my recently acquired Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer, and while the two never overlapped once, Hyrule and Link's adventures were constantly fresh in my mind as I tinkered away on this sweet voiced machine. If it sounds a bit ridiculous, my wife could tell you herself - for about 2 months, the Korg sat in our living room, occasionally propped on the sidearm of our sofa with my Zoom digital recorder and some headphones. So, that is what these pieces are, plus or minus some careful DAW editing and post-processing to fill them out, but no overdubs and no other instruments were used.\nArranging these recordings for this release now, a few other influences the material recalls are worth mentioning: Basil Pouledouris' landmark score for Conan The Barbarian, Roedelius' Selbstportrait albums, the ever-present SAW II, Johann Sebastian Bach (particularly his partitas) and probably also my Eufloria soundtracking from years back. I'm not certain how apparent any of these things are, but they are all very dear to me, and it's nice to occasionally notice them bubbling up to the surfaces of my improvisations.\nI'm planning a second volume of Hylian Improvisations, just as soon as I get a Korg Monologue and start building my own microtonal scales. Those green fields, dusty deserts, wind-swept cliffs and molten mountains are never too far away, and now with this tableaux of pieces, I feel that they are even closer.",

            "about": "\"Let all whom the sea loveth\nCome to its altar front\nAnd I\nWho can offer no other sacrifice to thee\nBring this.\"\n-H.D., excerpt from 'Hermonax' (1914)\n---\n'In Dark Waves' is the twenty-second Sleepbuilding session to be published online for free. It was originally broadcast overnight on March 17th, 2023, and explores the Dorian scale with the voice of the waveshaping VCO inside Expert Sleepers' Disting Mk4 multipurpose module.\nA languorous meditation, 'In Dark Waves' contemplates the solitude of a quiet evening in, perhaps with cold wind blowing outside, and feels apt to be published now when Winter brings the sun down so much earlier in the day. Like a handful of other sessions in this series before it, 'In Dark Waves' does not contain much in the way of developed melodic interest, nor does it feel particularly memorable, but rather, this is part of the point in exploring long runtimes as a compositional process - sometimes, the gravity of something can only be made apparent when it is operatively endless, woven into the air as a part of the listener's physical surroundings, thickening the darkness in a warm bedroom.\nIt is intended less as music in any traditional sense (and certainly, those of you looking for a traditional listening experience would be advised to search elsewhere) and more as an aural fabric, or perhaps a temperature and a texture combined by way of acoustic vibration and synaesthetic coloration. If my melodic and composed work could be represented visually with a marble plinth, then recordings like 'In Dark Waves' are the space around it.\nAs always, your mileage may vary, and what works for me here in this tangential self-care ritual may not make a whole lot of logical sense to you. Being a free download, I would still encourage any curious listeners to take the chance and see where 'In Dark Waves' might carry them, because for all of these empty airwaves pulsating in the dark, there must be *something* inside them that moves around, and as someone who feels just as much a passenger in these vessels as you do, being able to admit that I cannot define things, even after I have arguably created them, feels like a worthwhile consideration all by itself.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "'In Serial Chrome' is a piece of generative music made by running a Bliptronic 5000 \"toy\" polysynth into several samplers, granular processors and delays/reverbs. It was retrieved from the archives, from Spring 2021, for the occasion of augmenting three other sessions broadcast with the modular at that time: 'Silver Ore,' 'River Garden' and 'Isochronous Waves' - all of which have been collected on a special limited edition 4xCD-R set. It is emblematic of the Vibratelepathic music made during that time, with long slow sweeps of almost vocal-like timbres over a soft wash of noise and sustained tones, offering a picturesque soundfield that echoes the sparse and still Winter that persists outside the White Pillar studio doors.\nNOTE: All purchases of the 4xCD-R set will include Bandcamp download codes for 'Silver Ore,' 'River Garden' and 'Isochronous Waves' - look for an email sent to the address you paid with.",

            "about": "We heard a chord in the air\nOver the far hills and the river\nLingering between the ground and sky\nLike invisible fog\nI laid down beside this tree\nWeeping in a green arch\nGiven up on the sun\nNeither awake nor asleep\nIn between deference and death\nProstrate beneath the held tone\nExhausted, I said to you\n\"Each of us like you has died once\"\nWe just can't remember it\nA blade of grass, a raindrop in a cloud\nWoven through the cycles of the earth\nOscillating memory\nDissolved in the sun's rays\nAnd blown through the wind\nHovering vibrations\nSaturated by the passage of time\nEntropy modulating like a ripple in a pool\nHidden at the edge these woods\nTelling myself to be content that I am here\nNearer to or further from that recurrent moment\nI try to be silent, I try to be still, listening for the sound\n---\nN.B. - A two-part session from the archives of '22, final glossed and offered here in celebration of Earth Day '24. Made with the Korg Opsix and a sinewave monosynth \"pedal bass\" in what has come to be thought of as the \"old style\" of ambient Milieu albums.",

            "about": "Following in the vein of February's 'Silver Ore / River Garden' - which is to say, recordings that emerged from the many different Vibratelepathos sessions that felt distinct enough to issue separate from that imprint - is the Isochronous Waves session. Recorded live on the evening of April 27th, 2021, and broadcast online at Twitch as well, Isochronous Waves was an improvisation built with the ARP Odyssey monophonic analog synthesizer and the R-EW Audioholistics generative system and modular processing path.\nThe ARP Odyssey used here was purchased from David Tagg, and it has since become one of my favorite synthesizers I've ever had the pleasure to use. Not only does this machine possess what I consider to be one of the most functional and beautiful design interfaces out there, it also seems to continually avoid destabilization when it is pushed into directions that most other synthesizers fail to reach. What I mean by this, is that the three filter types, the ring modulator, even the sample and hold - they all seem to convey eloquent and interesting curvatures and textures, no matter how hard or incongruously they are driven and modulated. The ARP is, in this way, very much like the Roland Juno 106, and every single time I've sat down with these instruments, they assert their own distinct personalities within the framework of whatever recording is underway.\nMusically, this session conjured up imagery of great whales slowly bowing up and down beneath the ocean's surface. Dappled in ribbons of golden sunlight that flutter through the slate blue like unspooled tape, their songs echoing out through the dense watery forests like angelic horns filling all the rooms of a deep blue heaven. In this place, time is slower, movement is muted, light is softer. It is a perfect analog for the stillness of meditation and the mindfulness of deep breathing, and has accompanied me for the last year while I do those exact things. I offer it here to the public, in the hopes that it can facilitate even just a little bit of manual disconnection from the impossibly depressing world outside. I hope it helps you sleep, or think, or perhaps even just read something or rest your eyes, blotting out the day's headlines with a long slow brush stroke.",

            "about": "'Knows No Bounds' is a 200+ page paperback book, collecting one page each (sometimes a bit more) of written reflections on 124 different Milieu recordings - my personal favorites from twenty years and hundreds of albums. It is intended not to be a \"book\" in a traditional sense, and more of a companion piece to both tripartite volumes of 'Butcher Block Andromeda' and all three volumes of the supplemental 'Sunbather's Pharmacopeia' retrospectives. Something (hopefully) illuminating to pick up and thumb through while you listen to those compilations, as well as a reference text for the Milieu discography - a current-to-the-moment-of-publication catalog is included at the end of the book.\nInitially, I'd planned on only offering this book as a bonus item, something to be included in a \"deluxe\" edition of 'Butcher Block Andromeda' for added contexts and a cool collector's piece, but after spending most of 2024 penning these pages and really considering it, I've decided it belongs here as its own object, still issued in tandem with the retrospectives as originally intended. Since Bandcamp is a platform for selling music, and not books necessarily, it became obvious that some kind of musical component would be apt to pair with the book, so this abridged collection of tracks offered with the paperback is intended to still offer a purposeful look into my massive back catalog, selecting some of my very favorite tracks from all nine discs of the 'Butcher Block' and 'Sunbather's' compilations.\nFor the fullest experience, discounted bundles are being offered for both volumes of 'Butcher Block' along with all three 'Sunbather's' discs and the paperback, as well as smaller configurations of those items designed for listeners who already have certain parts of the set or only wish to pick up specific pieces. At this moment in time, no digital version of the 'Knows No Bounds' paperback is planned for release, as I largely prefer to encourage the fully analog experience of reading and listening - the richest way to spend one's free time, if you ask me.",

            "about": "Larx In Repose b/w Panama Coat, a two-track EP of Milieu tracks recorded during session work for the Coppice Halifax album Tigress. Unexpected and inadvertent, these two tracks remain inextricably connected to Tigress at a molecular level, but clearly retain attributes that make them feel more Milieu than Halifaxian, to my ears. Originally, the EP was given out as a gift to attendees of the Tigress Listening Party, on Twitch, but until now no subsequent release or lossless recording formats have been made available. In light of the current global lockdown, it felt appropriate to make these tracks available to everyone, and it is my sincere hope that they bring some happiness from across the distance.",

            "about": "Recorded in Spring 2012, with field recording work completed in January, this strange new Milieu album sat in storage for a few months while I mentally processed what I had made. Containing a very short opening vignette and a forty-minute-plus suite of warm drones that abruptly transition to a melodic midtempo electronic flavor, Last Wave is a somewhat strange vehicle for the Milieu sound to fit into. After repeated listens it occurred to me that I essentially created a piece of music that is all about being comfortable. Happily going nearly nowhere. Considering the tenuous anticipation during the time of the recording session (my daughter Penelope was due very shortly after) I think Last Wave was a subconscious (or maybe not so subconscious after all) attempt at building the most accommodating, familiar and easy-on-the-ear atmosphere possible. Taking musical cues from my Eufloria soundtrack works, Last Wave bubbles along on a bed of hospital field recordings made during ultrasounds, with thick layers of synthesized chords radiating up, like the wavy heat on a hot Summer street. By the time you pass the half-hour mark, you're plucked up out of the warmth and dropped into a slowly bouncing field of colorful balloons, with a gently propulsive drum machine moving things along while melodies cascade up and down and all around. As it happens, my daughter seemed to really enjoy listening to this record, and so perhaps it had to wait for her to arrive before it made sense to release it.",

            "about": "2009's ambient album Leaves Painted Purple came and went fairly quickly, as many Milieu releases go, but it always left a positive mark in my mind. I recorded it live during a very hot summer, between sessions for Analog Botany material. Coppice Halifax was fast becoming my main project, but Leaves was a nice reminder that Milieu was still around for serious consideration. After both a CD-R and cassette version of Leaves went out of print, I always knew I would someday revisit the material again, so here it is now. Remastered from the original fourtrack tapes, and augmented with a few like-minded pieces to really form a nice expansion on the original idea. The \"Appendage\" track was a cassette-only exclusive piece for the tape version of Leaves, while \"Delphine\" and \"Battle Hymn\" were previously issued on the incredibly limited (and also out of print) split album with Turquoise Turtles. \"Translucent Forestation\" was released as its own single that same year, and \"The Space Between\" and \"Sedentary Lifestyles\" both appeared much later on the Bedroom Waves split cassette with Solitary Nature, although they fit perfectly with the rest of the content here.\nAs I sit here now, in the midst of 2013's beautiful Autumn season, four years later...this album still resonates with me, as do the accompanying pieces. There's a strain of sadness in the very pretty organ melodies, layered deep beneath the warm guitar tones, and I think this material will be well met during the colder months approaching.",

            "about": "A studio recording of a live set at Milieu Music headquarters 114RKD, commissioned by a radio program named Solipsistic Nation. Bookended by an interview with the show's host Bazooka Joe, this live set was performed in the company of a small group of friends and family, as the artist imbibed and meandered in his usual fashion, benefiting from the atmospheric influence of his natural surroundings. Old tracks, new tracks and (at the time) unreleased tracks were jam packed into the set list, making a fascinating listen for those both familiar and unfamiliar with the Milieu catalog. Originally issued on a small CD-R run of 50, and now out of print. Available here for the first time digitally in any format.",
            "credits": "released May 5, 2009\nWritten, produced and performed by Brian Grainger, except #5: written and produced by Brian Grainger & Lee Batchelor, #6 written by Brian Grainger, produced and remixed by Mrs Jynx, and #8: written by Track53, produced and remixed by Milieu. Recorded at 114RKD, 2009. This is Milieu Music number MML058.",

            "about": "On February 9th, 2006, I put together a Milieu live set for a small group of family and friends, nearby the studio I was using at that time. This was an informal, although pre-planned, rehearsal for what may have become my live set in the Cayce countryside later that month. Attentive listeners will realize the drastic differences between this set and the Cayce set, which ended up winning out with newer pieces I'd finished and Coppice Halifax material, instead of this set, which is far more \"traditional\" Milieu material. So at some point, this recording was shelved away in the archive, to be accidentally located now, over 10 years later in 2016, while looking for master recordings of concurrent material. While there isn't much that hasn't been already released on offer here, the presentation and the processing of many of these tracks for the live environment are fascinating, making this recording an interesting time capsule of what felt fresh in Milieu-land ten years ago.",

            "about": "Since starting with music in 1997, I've been consistently fascinated with producing longform recordings. The longest single-session pieces I've created, to date, have been the 13.5 hour Autochromata III (a generative work) and the nearly 6 hour Night's Moisture (a sleep balm for my infant daughter) - both works by Coppice Halifax. Until now, Milieu as an entity has existed somewhere between rhythmic bedroom electronics and varying shades of ambient music, with many different configurations between the two. I've long wanted to put my name to a longform Milieu work, and with a recent commission for such from a close friend, it has finally come to fruition.\nLiving In The Shadow Of A Recursive Bell Whose Chime Echoed The Dawn Of Consciousness, while being a suitably lengthy title for what is an 8 hour near-generative ambient work, also bears some examination for the intent behind this recording, and the contexts it sprang from. It refers to numerous aspects of my first year of life as a resident of this windy Ohio valley, both obliquely and directly. On a more topical level, it is a poetic representation of the feeling I get waking up in the morning to the sound of that Ohio breeze blowing through the metal windchimes behind my kitchen, which coincidentally have been tuned to play a specific melodic passage from Igor Stravinsky's masterwork The Rite Of Spring. Since seeing the Disney film Fantasia as a boy, I have (probably like many American boys) associated that piece of music with the creation, and primordial Earth. So, it follows that hearing the individual notes of such a melody, while slowly regaining awareness, brings to mind a foggy recollection, a distant deeply buried understanding of the violent genesis of the world around me.\nOn a deeper, more abstract level, the title explains my fascination with generative systems - how a simple set of six notes can be infinitely and randomly arranged, and will only rarely play in the proper order of a recognizable melody. How, despite the seemingly infinite spaces between such occurrences, these melodic motifs do recur, conjuring the notion that time itself is the composer in this way, and not Stravinsky. Perhaps, in some way, Stravinsky's presentation of those six notes was itself a recurrence of a melody from some other prior time and space. An inevitable reiteration. An inescapable eventuality that absolves myself and anyone else of any actual artistic intent. We're just \"tapping into something in the air\", as my father used to say to me when we'd arrive at similar motifs in our guitar playing, completely separate from each other.\nSo this Milieu recording, too, has been plucked from the cool air blowing through this Ohio valley - no doubt passed on from some other set of aware ears. It exists everywhere, all the time, and also nowhere at all. And I am only a resident of time's currents, surfing on sine waves, letting the universe write the melodies, just as Eno, Lucier, Radigue and countless others have done before me.",

            "about": "Memory Hearth is a swirling storm of psychedelic color that coalesces and eventually explodes. A sonic vessel built out of solid gold and diamonds that takes a full hour to ascend into the clouds. This is a Milieu album as you have never before heard or experienced it. Filled to the brim with tape droning, shoegazing guitars and humming pedal bass, and led by both cut-up breaks and live drums and percussion, until it bursts with bright hot streams of sunny feedback and detuned melody. Meant to be played loud.",

            "about": "I am beyond happy to present a special new album called Memory Maker, created using a one of a kind system designed for capturing and recording audio from within actual dream states. This new system, which uses patented No-Fuss Telepathy technology, allows a musician like myself to enter into one of several different levels of sleep and generate music directly from my brain's activity (monitored using a special piece of equipment called the Invisible Digital Instrument Onboard Transport) onto a proprietary clear plastic disk, similar in the practical size and shape of a standard CD.\nAs this revolutionary new system is still within the beta-testing phase, it follows that these clear disks are only playable on specialized systems that have replaced the archaic laser reader with a Filtered Algorithm Keytone Extractor (soon to be available separately), which is what translates the unique recording format into sound that can be experienced outside of actual dream states.\nHowever, early testing has also shown that once listeners fall asleep, they are able to easily access the files on these clear disks regardless of their hi-fi setups, by using only a few simple meditation techniques that build upon Pauline Oliveros' deep listening studies in the 1960s and the fundamentals of the Goodiepal Equation. Supporters of this release will receive a printed guide, which details in a step by step list how to access the No-Fuss Telepathy methodology and begin listening to Memory Maker.\nFinally, there's no longer a need for clunky media formats like tapes or vinyl, or even localized files on streaming sites or digital storefronts! With Memory Maker, you can lie down in your bed, close your eyes and go to sleep, knowing that a vivid musical experience is not far behind you. Why not treat yourself to a new and enthralling way to hear music?\nMemory Maker can be played again and again, as often as you feel like doing it, and can sound different every single time. It can be a short album of jungle tracks, or an impossibly long monolith of ambient drift, because in your dream state, time no longer exists, and subsequently, music heard within that state does not need to adhere to any normal constraints. It is a psychologically proven fact that a person's perception is often more realistic to the senses than the actual state of reality being experienced, so why not give up on life and record collecting entirely? Buy the last album you will ever need, and go to sleep forever. You'll be glad you did.\nNOTE: The digital files featured here are only demos of the actual dream-state Memory Maker audio, and should be considered supplemental and completely inferior to their otherwise elegant and lush master takes.",

            "about": "Metraliminaloxone is a longform near-beatless Milieu piece that propels itself on wings of bass and emits rays of warm orange sunshine that long to caress your skin. Somewhere between Memory Hearth and Phosphene Weather, Metraliminaloxone was created live with a Roland SH-32 synthesizer, a Boss DR-880, a Lowrey organ, electric guitar and a small village of FX units, all humming and fuzzing and droning straight across the heads of a Tascam 414 tape machine. A lucid moment, captured, laid flat like a photograph and stretched across eighty minutes.",

            "about": "The Milieu self-titled album holds the rare uniqueness of being the only album out of the (literally) hundreds I've produced to simply be named Milieu. Not only is it one of the most important recordings on a personal level, but it represents a shift in thought, in how I approached writing music to begin with. In 2006, I hit some kind of critical mass with computer produced electronic music, and I longed for a more organic change that didn't have me hunched over a keyboard and screen for hours on end. I wanted my music to be made more immediately, more honestly even, and I was willing to make sacrifices to do it. Sometime that Summer, I turned the computer off, and sat down with only a guitar, some effects pedals, my Lowrey organ, a four-track tape recorder and an open window. From there, I played and played until something felt special, and that's what this album is. Milieu is a collection of twenty-two pieces, some short, some long, that depict a more pastoral ambient kind of personality, and they do so with a minimum of overdubbing and processing. A gentle hand is employed with a lot of patience and softness, deliberation, and seemingly abstracted pieces are in fact more composed than one would expect. Milieu is truly a dreamlike fantasist work of ambient instrumentation, and hopefully deserving of the title.\nIt was originally planned as a CD release at Jeremy Bible's Experimedia imprint, but the physical release was abandoned and it ended up being released for free there instead. After that, it was given a brief physical lifespan as a bonus disc for Of The Apple at SSR, but once again went off the map fairly fast. Now, finally, it has been remastered from the original tapes, and given a new cover from my collection of Holga photography, with nothing but respect given to Luke Hazard's original painted cover and his photographic cover that followed. Ironically, it is the first installment of the Arboreal Digest reissue catalog, but it has taken me such a long time to remaster that it is only now coming out.",

            "about": "Morning Acid could be considered a post-Housework series Housework entry. It collects several different live Milieu sessions that all feel unified through the selection of hardware they are composed with, and although the title of this collection implies acid and techno, there are certainly other colors and temperatures of braindance present also.\nThe various sessions presented here were recorded many different mornings while barely awake, often only moments after I would return home from driving my daughter to school, waiting for the coffee to kick in and nudging some faders with a half-melted mind. One was even performed while an HVAC repairman was doing work in my basement, though I'm not sure what he even made of it in hindsight. Like the Bismuth Cosmolog volumes at RP, Morning Acid showcases my playful and slightly weird side with analog machines and filter squawking, and feels much more cogent with all the different pieces assembled into a single, acid-fried whole.",

            "about": "Almost a year following the release of The Flower to Disappear, I have finally returned to it with a second single, a mini-cornucopia of warped Milieu melodies, sad-happy guitars and sun-warmed basslines, cast over chopped breaks and gate-abusing drum programming. 'Moth in the Milkglass' is my favorite track from the second \"side\" of The Flower to Disappear, and I am happy to revisit it here on what is less a single and a bit more of an EP.\nThe b-sides offered here are psychedelic jaunts of varying shades and temperatures. 'Plinth Punk' is a love letter to The B-52s (among many other things) and was written in/named after a 5-string guitar tuning of my own design, in a nod to the forever missed Ricky Wilson, and fellow B's fans will likely pick out a good few references to their sound. Never before has there ever been another band or artist who have influenced so much of my work, especially on Milieu recordings.\n'Now U 92' follows the ten-minute excursion with an alternative take of the midsection from 'White to Pale Yellow', a looping and droning nearly shoegaze mantra that brings the song's 1960s sample provenance a bit more to the forefront, and still deep fries it until it somewhat resembles something from Magic Arrows (or my take on it), another perennial favorite here.\nThe EP continues with 'Riverfree', something that began life as an alternative mix of 'Planet Everfree' but gradually shapeshifted into something a bit Halifaxian, a bit Bike too, which is how something ends up situated as a b-side to begin with I think. Imagine if 'Planet Everfree' was produced during the 'River Mural' sessions and you're close. 'Riverfree' is the only track on this EP that does not include guitar, incidentally.\nClosing the set is the slow-burn feelgood 'Royal Rover', echoing more than a few shapes on the Thalline Dress album, which to my mind remains one of my strongest statements for the arrival of Spring. For all of the misunderstood ladies who wear the Thalline Dress, the 'Royal Rover' is their vessel, and I have built it to weather the seasick waves just for them.\nNow that the Winter is withering away, and I've broken ground on composed work such as this, it is my sincere hope that I can finish my next album of arranged and ornamental music, ideally in time for my birthday, but I am hesitant to promise. For now, here is 'Moth in the Milkglass' - a branch in the path before us that is always there, the ever-present 'other' simply waiting to be chosen.",

            "about": "'Mural Hex' is, as the name implies, a sixth track from the 'River Mural' sessions in 2022. It was an outtake at that time, and upon the recent remastering of that album (forthcoming in April), it was rediscovered as a Milieu track that emerged from a Coppice Halifax recording process.\nIn the wake of 'Watch the Head' the abandoned remnants were recontextualized, augmented by newer parts and constructed into the new EP before you now. The track is a kind of showcase for the Korg Poly 800 polysynth, which I acquired in December, and this machine plays all the basslines that lead the song through the various polymetric sections. Supporting the Poly 800 are a number of other digital synthesizers - GForce's remake of the Oberheim SEM and Waldorf's PPG Wave VST as well as staple 6-operator FM and Karplus-Strong synths from other Milieu albums.\nDuring the mastering process for 'Mural Hex' I unexpectedly found all the pieces were present for a Coppice Halifax dub as well, and across a couple stoned evenings, put this alternate take together to be included here. This cut was built with the same machines as the original mix, with the addition of the MS-2 three operator FM synthesizer and some drum parts designed on my modular system.\nThe EP closes with a beatless reprise of the title track, which isolates all of the non-rhythmic and non-bass elements from 'Mural Hex' and routes them through a granular resampling system, with the resultant audio being played over with new parts on the SEM and Poly 800, and further developed into a new composition that still echoes the original at a more subconscious level.",

            "about": "In March, earlier this year, I issued a monument of generative ambient music: the eight-hour Living In The Shadow Of A Recursive Bell Whose Chime Echoed The Dawn Of Consciousness (  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/living-in-the-shadow-of-a-recursive-bell-whose-chime-echoed-the-dawn-of-consciousness  ). This massive release was sourced from a single 2-hour live session, parsing many different synthesizers apart for reconstitution into what became the final work. Until now, that original session has remained unreleased, heard and seen only by the few members of the Milieu Music Fan Club at that moment in time.\nThe session took place during the evening hours of January 13th, 2018, and across the two-hour runtime, you are able to hear ten different synthesized voices emerge one at a time, seamlessly and gracefully, blown by the shapes of electronic wind currents and filtered through narrow banded hallways of EQ and reverberation. Half of the synthesizers were analog (Korg Volca Bass, Korg Volca Keys, Korg MS-20, Arturia Microbrute, DSI MoPho) and half were digital (Grass C-TCM, Roland SH-32, Yamaha QY-70, Boss DS-330, Korg Volca Sample), coalescing together each at a different independent tempo. Allowing each machine to move at its own pace meant that the individual sequences would never overlap in the same way twice - composed, and yet totally random and incidental. This process allowed me to become just as immersed in the playback of the sound, and the physicality of it, as those observing. All I needed to do the entire time was decide when and how the individual elements might enter/exit the mix, and tweak EQs/volume levels to suit, to make sure things remained spacious and uncrowded.\nHaving had almost a year away from this recording, and coming back to it only recently, for mastering and subsequent release, I think it is an even more interesting piece than it was when it happened. My studio hardware has expanded and changed since then, so in many ways, this recording is just as much defined by the space and time of that January evening as it was by the slow LFOs and disparate sequence layouts. There's also always a slight strain of melancholy running through my work, Milieu especially, and that has only become more apparent here with time. Gently split in half to be etched across two white discs, Muzak is presented digitally in its unedited format, conveniently available in both dosages for home or traveling playback.",

            "about": "\"The holy, familiar hall, built long ago, is aired and filled with heavenly, softly echoing, quietly modulating music. A cloud of joy sends fragrance over the green carpets. Shining in the distance, a splendid row of gold-wreathed cups stands, well-ordered, full of ripe fruits.Tables stand at the sides, rising above the leveled ground. For now in the evening, loving guests have gathered, coming from far.\"\n-Friedrich Hölderlin, excerpt from 'Celebration of Peace'\n'Natural Green' is the thirteenth Sleepbuilding broadcast to be published, continuing the expansive lineage of long-form generative ambient recordings that are offered digitally for free to everyone. It was broadcast overnight on June 25th, 2023 at YouTube, and like 'Burned Oath' before it, runs over twelve hours long - nearly a full day of sonic utility with no right or wrong application.\nThis composition was a first for the series in that it used the Arturia Microfreak to convey the sequencing and synthesized voice, rather than the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, which usually handles these tasks. I've written prolifically about the Microfreak before, and once again, it displays a fantastic versatility and range as an instrument that can in many ways keep pace with a fully developed modular system. The sound of 'Natural Green' consists of a formant synthesizer voice I developed alongside the machine's complex patching matrix, making efficient use of the non-stepped sample and hold low frequency oscillator, the bandpass filter and a very slow arpeggiator cycling through four paraphonic notes (in the Mixolydian scale) with multiple different randomization attributes applied. The R-EW Audioholistics system supplemented the Microfreak by providing timing/tempo information from a Turing machine and probabilistic/subdivider trigger array, as well as generating a stereo image from the Microfreak's monophonic output with constantly evolving reverberation, modulation and some additional filtering via Strymon's Starlab module.\nTexturally, the Sleepbuilding broadcasts tend to fall loosely into two categories when I listen to them: daytime listening, and nighttime listening - with 'Natural Green' decidedly feeling more a part of the former category to me. It feels vibrantly alive in a floral and sunny way, with dapples of orange light fluttering across leaves and blooms in a warm Summer breeze. The melodies shift in and out of focus, at times distant and spacious like a blue sky, and at others, closer and intimate, a macro-lens view of a thriving ecosystem.\nI chose this recording for publication after a number of factors were considered - a longtime listener who works in the visual art world asked about it, having enjoyed it when it was first broadcast, and then following this, I consulted with the I Ching to determine where the series might next go, with the I Ching illuminating 'Natural Green' in such a way that I felt like I'd missed something obvious up to that moment. In many ways, both topical and conceptual, 'Natural Green' is about sharing space, familial with the Earth, acknowledgement in an almost spiritual sense of the reality that none of us are really alone in this world, and that wherever we might end up if we are to enrich and evolve our place in the universe, we must go there together.\n----\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

It was composed by sampling ground hum in the White Pillar Workshop, and subsequently processing/layering/tuning several instances of the sound in order to manifest a beautiful flowing river of chordal drones.\nAlthough it is presented as an incredibly quiet recording, it is also designed to be played much louder, with more detail and texture present than one might expect for a five-hour drone wall.",

            "about": "NEROLI STATUARY is the confluence of several working methodologies and longstanding influences, a meeting point between melodic ambient albums like STATUETTES, DAUGHTER, ELIDE and TRANSPOSITION GRADIENTS IN CYAN & BURNT ORANGE. In this crossroads, I've assembled a collection of improvisations and generative sequences on the Roland Juno 106 digital polysynth. In July of 2021, the Juno was graciously and unexpectedly given to me as a gift, and NEROLI STATUARY is both the fruit of my initial labor with the machine, and a prosaic letter of thanks to the kind person who made it all possible.\nLeading this collection is \"White Alice (July 10)\" - the very first piece I ever recorded with the Juno - which was ceremoniously released on Lee Norris' Neotantra label as part of a recent compilation, an informal christening of the machine's presence in my work. Following this are several explorations of single patches already present on the Juno, something I sought to keep intact until I could record at least one piece for each one. For those unaware, the Juno can contain 128 patches, so by the logic used here, there will be several more volumes of NEROLI STATUARY to come. (Also, this does not mean I am not designing my own patches yet, but rather, I haven't saved any of them in the Juno's memory at this point in time, but this is not an uncommon practice with many of my machines.)\nWhat you hear on this first volume, then, is equally inspired by perennial staples like SAW II, Roedelius' Selbstportraits and Jochem Paap's FAX albums, as well as taking influence from more Berlin-school ideas, using more arpeggiators as a rhythmic/chordal bed to play monophonic lead lines over - something the Juno does exceptionally well with its six voice polyphony - and, incidentally, Eno's namesake piece invoked here is never very far away either (I say incidentally because NEROLI STATUARY is an anagram and was discovered procedurally). These pieces are either entirely improvised and played by hand, or they've been built out of sequences input on an Arturia Keystep Pro that the Keystep then pulls apart probabilistically according to internal randomization engines with their own curves and logics. Both approaches are necessary in order to fully maximize the Juno's potential range on any given patch, and often where one method does not work, the other will. In this way, the Juno possesses a distinct personality that gently guides your workflow according to its own sensibilities, and many times over it ends up feeling as if the machine is playing itself.\nThe pieces offered here are not intended to each feel wholly remarkable, but hopefully form a more cogent fullness when they can all be considered together. Aside from a single reverb or delay effect on any given track, and selective parametric equalization, everything you hear on NEROLI STATUARY comes from the Juno alone. It felt seasonally appropriate to release after Autumn arrived fully, and I hope it lends a subtle color and texture to your Autumn days or nights (or both), as it has been an unexpected passenger with me since I've finalized it.\nNOTE: For more Juno 106 ambience, check out Milieu's White Alice I+II 2xCD-R at Vibratelepathos:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com/album/white-alice-i-ii",

            "about": "New Drugs, when I conceived it, was many things. At least, it was intended to be. Whether or not it currently exists within any of my original contexts is unknown and, for the moment, irrelevant. At the time, it was a line drawn in the sand, where there was clearly music that came before and then this. Something about it seemed special, a little magical, to the degree that I hadn't felt this strongly about a record I made since Slow Lid Close. This was, to my ears, the pinnacle of the original Milieu sound. The chopped up drum breaks from old jazz, funk and hip hop LPs that I'd introduced on In Hills Made Of Clouds. The tight and \"in the pocket\" basslines from Slow Lid. The balanced yet pronounced drum machine voices from Our Blue Rainbow. The psychedelic smear melodies and cassette warp textures from all over the Milieu catalog. It was drafted in sexual and substance abusing symbolism, yet presented with the sincerity of a family photo album. The parts of New Drugs are indeed unique and individualistic, but I happen to feel they really do serve the greater whole, and that the album is itself an entity, a body, with happy, sad and bittersweet memories all its own.\nI took New Drugs with me to Germany in 2007, when I performed at Lab 30. It was very much by my side when I went from never having flown on a plane before to soaring across the sea and spiraling down over so many little gingerbread house rooftops. The album actually preceded my arrival there, as I found out when I went into two different shops and heard it playing. Again, something special about it, and I can never quite say just what it is. Perhaps it is the fact that, for all its conceptual and aesthetic wrapping, the music on New Drugs is almost totally without pretense. It exists as immediate and feel-good pop music, both ornamental form and utilitarian function, built to last across a thousand hot summers.\nSo here it is again, in its third incarnation, nine years after its original issue date and almost ten years after the sessions themselves. Another pretty package of sunsets for sale, from me to you.",

            "about": "Of The Apple was the second ambient album I created for the triptych of Milieu / Of The Apple / Sun White Sun in 2006, and perhaps the most unique. In addition to the guitar and organ format for the instruments, a couple tracks actually contain (distant, nearly imperceptible) rhythms, and after David Tagg and I created Second Sun Recordings to house our work as VCV and Viking Destroyer, we agreed that Of The Apple would be an appropriate thing for SSR to issue. A factory-pressed digipack CD (still a minority among the dozens of CD-Rs in my catalog) was drafted and as a special send-off, David and I collaborated on a fifteen-minute piece that was made to bring the curtain down on the album. Considering that Coppice Halifax was forging through its first year as an entity at the same time Of The Apple was recorded, it should be no surprise that the OTA pieces containing deep rhythms somewhat resemble early Coppice Halifax material (such as \"Bronze\" from 1983). Stylistically, OTA is also unique in that it feels far more \"composed\" than its bookended counterparts - evidence that I was hitting a very pleasant stride with my computer-free setup and actually exploring new ground. The improvisation is still omnipresent, but there seems to be more...discernment, when it comes down to what ended up on the tape. Almost everything on OTA is live and without overdubs, the exceptions being \"Stone Chapel / Statuettes 2\" and the closing track with David Tagg. The concept of OTA was solidified well before I ever recorded it - a series of pleasant and surreal dreams I was having in 2003-2004 gave me the impetus to record something with this specific atmosphere, even though I was unable to fully realize it until 2006. Today, perhaps because of the melodic quality of the album, or even because it got a factory pressed release years ago, Of The Apple remains a favorite of fans, which makes me beam with happiness every time someone writes to tell me how much it means to them. Like Sun White Sun, I've elected to leave Of The Apple untouched in the mastering department, as it think it still sounds as perfect as it was when I completed it almost ten years ago. Instead, I have gone back to the original session tapes as source and derived a massive Coppice Halifax remix of \"Oceans\", taking a full 70+ minutes to explore its depths.",

            "about": "Our Blue Rainbow has become something of an iconic Milieu album, having been the starting point for my work amongst many different people. Recorded in 2005-2006, and issued on an edition of 200 at Expanding Electronic Diversity, the album was an immediate success and sold out quickly, even spawning not one but two different remix albums. In 2010, the Ohio label I, Absentee reissued the album on another 100 copies, this time being remastered and repackaged with new artwork designed by David Tagg (who designed the original release at EED years earlier). This album has never been available digitally until now, and as of January 2012, all physical editions of Our Blue Rainbow are out of print. This digital version is the remaster from the 2010 reissue.",
            "credits": "released December 13, 2010\nAll music W/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at 1027PDS / 1712FHC / 114RKD, 2005-2006. Originally issued at Expanding Electronic Diversity as EEDCD002. Remastered from the original session tapes, Summer 2010.",

            "about": "For the odd-numbered occasion of the fourteenth anniversary since it was first issued, OUR BLUE RAINBOW is once again in print (after a brief reinstatement on I, Absentee in 2010, itself already a decade gone) and comes backed by the OUR BLUE REMIXES and OUR BONUS REMIXES albums of reworkings, in a special third edition 3xCD set.\nMusically, OUR BLUE RAINBOW always seemed to exist in the in-between spaces, with things like SLOW LID CLOSE or NIGHT CURRENTS right behind us and NEW DRUGS or COLORTONE coming up soon after. It feels like aspects of all of those albums, and yet still also maintains a bittersweetness that isn't really so saturated anywhere else but here. There are many very upbeat moments of optimism and bass-pocket groove juxtaposed against chordal sequences that sound like rainclouds. There are down-tuned and slow-tempo moments that give way to sunny daybreaks and THC-fried memory fog. OUR BLUE RAINBOW is everyone's look back through a breath-smeared bus window, ready to go home, never quite able to, Summer forever around the corner or clipping at your heels as it swiftly passes you by, another wasted magic season in the curvatures of another blurry year.\nFor me, my Blue Rainbow is full of aching and longing, missing my old friends, my parents, my sister, an electric plant, a lake. Thinking about my old Beretta, bummed out boredom-soaked weekends, having a band but never having anywhere to play. Writing out lists of ideas and names that refused to take form until years, sometimes decades later. Saving things and carrying them around only to realize that the weight of their accumulation wasn't worth the steep ticket fare, and then...here we are anyway, after all, right where we belong.\nAnd here you will find twelve original recordings that hopefully suffuse these thoughts and images into something more valuable than the aggregated act, and if not, you've got two whole albums of excellent remixes from the likes of Am-Boy, Ourson, David Tagg, Adam Pacione, Mrs Jynx, EOD, Brian Ellis, Wisp, Drexon Field and many more, even me hiding in plain sight with a Coppice Halifax remix when Fieldtriqp couldn't make the deadline. All of it collected here in a single tripartite set, ready for another ten years of sad Summers.\nNOTE: The I, Absentee reissue in 2010 came with a bonus album called BENT APPLETAPE, which was an unreleased album from 2006. This has been separately reissued on CD-R in conjunction with OUR BLUE RAINBOW and can be purchased here:",

            "about": "When I returned from a harrowing trip to Cleveland and back in August, my physical and mental wellness were both severely lacking. I was desperately in need of some recuperative care on both accounts, and set about doing it one of the best ways I know how to - recording ambient music in my studio. The fruits of those efforts became the Transposition Gradients triple-album, The Synthesist's Alphorn Retreat and final touches on the Daughter sessions and Four Passages, which were four previously recorded ambient sessions unified on a single release. A lot of music, to be certain, but for the mindset I was in, and the immense need I had for it, it was not yet enough. I needed to be buried in the anesthetic vibration of sub-basslines and drifting analog delays, floating endlessly on sun-dappled soundwaves. So, in the spirit of that outlook, it should surprise you not at all to find that there was even more material laid to tape and held back from immediate release.\nThis piece, titled Passage Five, was one that only went to my bedside when it was completed, at the time. It is a transfiguration of tape source used on the Four Passages album, routed through copious FX chains of analog and digital profiles, layered and re-layered and melted down, with a monophonic analog synthesizer anchoring the exploration with a simple and hypnotic sub-bassline.\nSpecifically, it returns to and addresses the bereft feeling I was overtaken with, standing in pitch blackness on the roadside in the middle of the deep countryside, van wrecked, dead deer laid in the grass at my feet, highway patrol flares quickly dying out, as metal mammoths sped by, mere inches from my broken vehicle. Phone battery nearly dead, wife and child stranded alongside, no resolution in sight. In a state like that, you begin to wonder if you'll ever get out alive, and if you manage that, whether or not you'll be able to recover from it easily. It's a deep and depressing feeling to be that helpless and to have lost that much control over your situation, and that space in my mind is the hole I had to spend all of August and most of September crawling back out of. My slow return to the land of the living continues to yield strange fruits, and it is my sincere hope that they fill the world with that much more contentment and ease, and offset the liminal darknesses of the world we live in, because that world can be a frightening and unforgiving place.",

            "about": "It was 2009, two years into the INSTALL label I co-owned and operated with sun-brother David Tagg, and three years into our vanity imprint Second Sun Recordings. David and I were always brimming with enough ideas to populate entire catalogues with, and almost as much energy to manifest them. I’m not sure where or when the discussion started, but pressing vinyl was the name of our game that year. Our first was the Arctic / Blue Dub 12”, cut from the collaborative vehicle SEAS, which David and I used for our electronic explorations, as the curtain release in the Expanding Electronic Diversity catalogue. That went well enough, but was very nearly a disaster, mostly due to the fact that the pressing plant that manufactured it was actually a plastics company out of New Jersey, who apparently knew next to nothing about the process. I’d found them somehow, and we pursued it only because they were within driving distance from David’s design company in Long Island, and because they were willing to cut only 100 copies for us. All kinds of amateurish problems plagued the process, yet despite those aspects of it, we were determined to do it again, better the second time around.\nSomewhere in there, likely the Spring-Summer of 2009, I’d finished recording work on what was designed to be my first vinyl release as Milieu. I cannot remember how long I’d toiled over it, but I remember logging a good amount of time on it, likely all through the previous season. It was all done the old fashioned way, with a bit of a purist approach on my Westone Concorde I electric guitar, my Lowrey “Magic Genie” organ, a Tascam 414 Mk. II four-track tape machine and a large amount of effects boxes. Field recordings were captured on a portable digital recorder at my Columbia home (Rolling Knoll) and my mother-in-law’s home deeper in the country (Foxhill), and bounced to reel-to-reel tape on a Roberts 450A tape machine.\nThe material recorded was intended to represent a sort of pinnacle point in the mountain ranges of my ambient work, referential to things like the self-titled Milieu album, the sunken orchestral processing of the Beyond The Sea / Beyond The Stars albums and the wind-blown textures of A Warm Wooden Hollow. Listening to it now, ten years later, it is apparent to me how close the material is to my Sun-Day series, and there’s even a little bit of my Eight Thousander rehearsal-tape-that-then-became-an-album in there too.\nA close friend of mine from New Zealand, who for years was my “second ears” on certain projects, wrote back after listening to it with the comment “Another sunset for sale”, which has followed me around since then, especially when I am producing music that has such a clearly emotive and filmic bend to it. And it did feel like quite a colorful sunset that November, when we got the random-color splattered 12”s and heard, for the first time, Milieu unspooling from analog grooves in slow spirals.\nThe titling employed for these recordings was initially only a reference to my lifelong practice of laying down to sleep with my arm draped over my eyes, applying just enough pressure to light up an ever-evolving array of psychedelic visuals, dancing around on the insides of my eyelids – phosphenes. Communicating the notion to David, who was doing the visual design work for it, was difficult at first – I was always dragging my designer friends through hell with my badly translated ideas - but once we happened upon the halftone in black and white, it all seemed to settle into place, and I felt that David really outdid himself with the seven pieces he created, which seem to say so much about movement and the suggestion of forms, but give the listener nothing concrete to latch onto.\nI didn’t even know what the phenomenon was called until I was in my twenties, and it felt like an appropriate analogy for my music, especially my relationship with the guitar – operating for years in the dark, on impulse, reactively learning and growing through trial and error (mostly error), carving out a creative voice that owed just as much to the adversity and lack of proper tools as it did to whatever was happening in the wrists...only to stumble, clumsy and dazed, upon the names of these things later, long after they had become second nature to me. I’d spent most of my teenage years feeling like I was running to keep up with all of my peers, as an instrumentalist – mostly because I never had any training, or knew the “right way” to do anything – and now, on the 10th anniversary of this landmark recording I made in the blistering heat of the subtropical South, I cannot help but feel that I pushed myself into some indefinable creative space through my years of blind determination. Pulling all of the lonesome sadness out of these six metal strings in humid bedrooms, distilling it down into another sunset for sale.\n- Brian Grainger\nNovember 13th, 2019 / Dayton, Ohio",

            "about": "\"Planet Everfree\" is the first single from The Flower to Disappear, the forthcoming new Milieu album, due to release on June 23rd 2022 on digital and ltd. edition CD formats. Recorded during Summer of 2021 for inclusion on the 11th Cottage Industries compilation at Neo Ouija, it was not apparent until Winter that this track was not merely a one-off, but the first step of a new Milieu album.\nWith a title lovingly plucked from the angelic harmonies of Kate and Cindy, the cut conjures up visions of a beautiful green and blue landscape, a peaceful place and time, filled with joy and contentment - a distinct and deliberate contrast against the state of the world we live in today. I decided to focus the work I was doing for this album on the act of escapism - what could facilitate it? For myself, rituals of escapism include so many things, most of which I need on a weekly or even daily basis in order to keep my head on my shoulders - coffee, jazz and metal music, sunshine, creative work, time spent with my family, willful ignorance of headlines and the information overload of the internet, THC, cozy slippers, domesticated animals, literature and poetry, MST3K, vintage cartoons, comedies and sitcoms, conversations with friends and respected colleagues, video games, sleep and meditation. That's a long list, and not nearly complete, but it really convinced me that this was the way forward - the mechanism I needed to cut through the mire of suffering, pain and war - and that in doing so, I would be able to bring these tools to others, in the hopes that they could use them as well as I have, to escape, even momentarily.\nSome methods of facilitating escapism are not necessarily healthy, either, and I wanted to outline this difference with my work as well. Self-care is not selfishness, escapism is not egotism, and there can be no us without you and I being here first. So, \"Planet Everfree\" and by extension, The Flower to Disappear, are both my direct contribution to the facilitation of escapism through purely pleasant, safe and hopefully enriching paths. The further I go into the realms of philosophy and the deeper my understanding of the uncompromising universe we find ourselves in, the more apparent it becomes to me that we could accomplish so much for ourselves and each other by simply being kind, by embodying empathy, patience, forgiveness and love, because the universe is not designed with these things in mind. The void is the void, an abyss that cares not, sees not, gives and takes without reason or justification.\nI often see people quoting that phrase \"You must be the change you wish to see in the world\" - and this is a good start - but I happen to believe that this is not merely enough. Embodiment of change and principles of progress only gets us so far. We must go further, inspire ourselves, challenge ourselves and each other to do better, to build things, to reach past the mundane survival we have barely kept up, and to really truly work, toward a better time and place for everyone.\nIt's funny to me, that I just turned 39, and you'd think that with middle age comes some kind of conservatism, the dreaded \"Get off my lawn\" disconnect of all of our lives, but instead, I continually feel that the older I get, the more naive I somehow become. The more I learn, the less I know. It's as if I have decided that the teachings of the modern world that I and everyone else have drilled into ourselves when we become adults are just constructs, designed by others, devoid of empathy, things built to perpetuate the way things have been, the way they already are. With my work, here in the musical world and elsewhere in the written word and visual metaphor, I refute these systems and structures, I deny them and return them to whoever invented them to begin with. They do not serve us, they do not carry us forward - only hope and love can do that.\nThis is a lot, I know, especially for copy on a single of electronic music, but I promise you, as someone who has dedicated his entire adult life to the creative act, that it can get better. Make things, be kind, be constructive and not destructive, be mindful of others, try to learn something new each day, try to understand that you can't ever know everything either. Know yourself, and help others get to know themselves, and while I cannot say any kind of karma exists in the world, I am certain that positive thought leads to positive action, and positive action leads to a better world for everyone. On the road to a better world, we're going to need all the relief we can get - we will all need a flower to disappear.\nSo here are four different strains of pleasurable escapism for you - two of them filled with polymetric psychedelia and enough stimming and sensory overload that the spectrum-dwellers like myself out there listening will feel right at home. There is a short composition for finger-picked 10-string acoustic guitar and Karplus-Strong synthesizer, as well - a palate cleanser I hope. Finally, there is a fantastic alternative mix of \"Burgundy Boredoms\" (another LP cut) from near and dear friend Zwei Kreise, which recalls many of our favorite textures and shapes from the late 90s-early 00s electronic sound. I have also assembled a video for \"Planet Everfree\" which contains mutated visuals built from a 1936 cartoon I grew up watching, and some prose written for the new album, and you can watch that here:  youtu.be/OCmVorGhyRk\nFinally, there is a special listening party event scheduled for 7 PM EST on Wednesday June 22, 2022, where ticket holders can listen to the entirety of The Flower to Disappear ahead of release, while enjoying semi-generative visuals and a jovial chatroom. You even get a bonus EP download when you grab a ticket:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/merch/milieu-the-flower-to-disappear-new-album-listening-party-ambient-modular-set",

            "about": "Originally issued at Archaic Horizon in 2007 as Wasted Magic In The Sound, this collection of Milieu remixes has been refitted to lead the long awaited series of Milieu remix works, Plangent Liqueurs.\nFor years, remixing has been one of my favorite production activities. It has allowed me the opportunity to repeatedly test out new ideas, while simultaneously challenging myself to mold something new with someone else's sounds. As many of you already know, my remixes have always been so different from their originals that they are basically new pieces, although this is meant with no disrespect to the original artists. Quite the contrary, this decision is made out of respect for them, with my feeling that a carbon copy of anything is just a waste of time. So in many ways, my remixes as Milieu (and subsequently Coppice Halifax) are like islands surrounding the greater landmasses of certain albums from my catalog. For instance, it's easy to hear Three Tone Quintet in the Lumme remix, or New Drugs in the Ascalaphe remix.\nAt the time this collection was assembled, all of these remixes were pretty rare if not completely unreleased. In the time since then, I've wanted very badly to collect all of the Milieu mixes into an ongoing episodic format, like I've also done with the considerable amount of Coppice Halifax remixes. Like lots of things, plans were made and abandoned numerous times over, so finally it falls to me to bring these tracks back to the surface again - I couldn't be happier. Stick around for subsequent volumes of Plangent Liqueurs, as there are already five in total, with a sixth almost complete.\n*EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm aware that all of these tracks, while being my work, exist with the original artists' names on them. Since it's been NINE YEARS (or more in some cases), I have long since lost my contacts with many of these very cool musicians. SO, if one of you has found this release and wants a copy for your contribution to it, PLEASE get in touch with me. It would be great to catch up anyway.",

            "about": "The second volume of Plangent Liqueurs, subtitled Melted Crayon Radioband, continues on the eclectic path of collecting Milieu remixes and arranging them into albums.\nThe memories on this one are pretty ridiculous...I remember making the Plantre remix for Luke on a shitty HP machine in the tiny room my wife and I were living in out in the country. The first approach to A Distant Monarch was a pretty melody and distorted drums combo that was a loving nod to Mr. Canupp's earlier works. The remix for Cats On Earth is still one of my favorites today, another one I squeezed out of that awful grey HP. The Obfusc remix was fun, I remember Boltfish was really in a stride back then and that album was no exception. The When2 remix is actually the very first Milieu remix ever, made on an even shittier computer when I was still living in shitty Myrtle Beach. Endless Green was a fun rephrasing of Chris Orczy's beautiful harmonium music, and this mix really presages Coppice Halifax in a lot of ways. The Redspine mix for Electricwest was one of those \"stay up til dawn rubbing your eyes\" tracks, and my first draft the next day nearly blew my car's speakers with that bass. Nash Smith & Ganges were a band who toured in my town a few years ago, invited Milieu to open for them. The show was a bit of a wash but we all had fun, and they asked me to do this remix for them afterward. This one, along with the remix I did for The Qualia and another for The Artificial Sea, were rare moments of Milieu that dabbled in vocals, and looking back I really like all the careful processing I applied to the vox in the Hunters mix. The Emma Cora remix was an easy one to do, felt very effortless at the time and I like that about it....it feels breezy somehow. The Silo Romano mix was done right after I was working with David Tagg at his Expanding Electronic Diversity imprint, and you can hear Our Blue Rainbow all over this mix. The Alpha Chime remix came together somewhat unexpectedly after Experimedia asked me to master a collection of unreleased tracks by the talented Miles Tilmann, who I was already a major fan of from his vinyl at Toytronic. The closing track is one of two remixes I did for Scaldis, who were releasing something with U-Cover and asked me for a mix, though I cannot be certain that these mixes ever saw the light of day until now...\n*EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm aware that all of these tracks, while being my work, exist with the original artists' names on them. Since it's been NINE YEARS (or more in some cases), I have long since lost my contacts with many of these very cool musicians. SO, if one of you has found this release and wants a copy for your contribution to it, PLEASE get in touch with me. It would be great to catch up anyway.",

            "about": "Continuing the Plangent Liqueurs series of Milieu remix collections, volume three assembles a set of very groovy 2004-2007-era Milieu mixes, with a couple more technical and glitchy mixes towards the middle of the sequence. Opening with the second version of the \"For Starters\" remix I did for Scaldis, which (like the first one) was never released for some reason. This mix is very much along the lines of Our Blue Rainbow, with lots of chopped up breaks and really swirly sunny melodies weaving in and out. Next up is the epic and droney \"Mushroom Field\" remix I did for BTB at Boltfish, sometime right before or right after my Tandem Series split with ENV(itre) there. This one is a full on psychedelic swamp, complete with a pulsing beat that is 25% running backwards the whole time. Things loosen up for the funky \"Free Way\" remix for Brian Ellis, who was in the midst of his Benbecula releases at that time, if I recall correctly. This mix would have fit perfectly on the New Drugs album, with all the funky break work and busy bassline runs, while bright sheets of sinewave leads cascade over the top. From there, things get a bit darker with the Pisgah remix - a shameless nod to Tri Rep-era Autechre and probably a little Haujobb in there too. The whole thing bumps and skitters around until it dissolves into a field of humming pads, giving way to the second Milieu mix of Ten And Tracer's excellent \"A Distant Monarch\". This mix is a bit more grungy and head-nodding than the first mix, with references to some of Canupp's much earlier tracks (which at that time were *beyond* rare and hard to acquire). Back into some precision editing territory with the \"Lattice Trees\" remix I made for Box (aka Jeremy Bible's one-off electro project). Bonus points to anyone who can name the source of the remix tag's reference. This one is squarely a love letter to DIN-era Arovane. Luke Hazard's earlier Plantre project returns for a second version of the Astur/Atmos Worm remix, this one a heavily processed and backmasked version of the first, which itself contained some reversed elements. I couldn't decide which direction I preferred at the time, so I went with both. Scup Bucket, my collaborative partner in Flax Harmonade, is next with a Night Currents-fuzzbox rendition of his \"Dofleini\" track. Beginning the curtain call is my \"Simple Station\" mix of Resynthesize's \"Supersynth\" track, a drafted work for Experimedia, where I was a very prominent contributor at the time for mastering, album art and remixes. This one definitely falls into the Our Blue Rainbow session camp again, with lots of tape-drenched sinewave melodies and over-compressed drum lines. The sendoff for this volume is the luscious ten-minute space out mix I made for Forrest's \"Free Loop 2\". This one emerges from a wall of tape loops and organ pedal bass before bringing in a drum part from the same organ, and then layer upon sweet layer of drum break, female vocal and organ leads. A pleasant cloud to slowly let you down from at the end of the evening, and one more album of Milieu remixes that feels like anything but!\n*EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm aware that all of these tracks, while being my work, exist with the original artists' names on them. Since it's been NINE YEARS (or more in some cases), I have long since lost my contacts with many of these very cool musicians. SO, if one of you has found this release and wants a copy for your contribution to it, PLEASE get in touch with me. It would be great to catch up anyway.",

            "about": "The long-stalled fourth volume of Plangent Liqueurs - Sedated Electric Midranges - arrives at the perfect time, at the terminus point of a long, weird Summer. A twelve-track retrospective jaunt back through the many vibrant landscapes I've tread and interpreted as a remix producer through the last sixteen years, volume four is more full of melodic content and interesting mixing decisions than my memory initially recalled. Notable entries are the presence of a vocal track on \"Should Be Home\", which was my pass at what pioneers like RDJ have already done years ago - taking a band's pop song and completely rewriting a new set of verse and chorus changes beneath the singer's vocals. \"White Elephant\", \"Since Then\" and \"Kites\" could all have been included on the New Drugs or Swaying Palms albums, while \"80s Coast\" and \"2802\" have more in common with records like Academy Stripes or H Is For Hologram. The closing piece, my third pass at Ten and Tracer's gorgeous \"A Distant Monarch\" gives off Halifaxian impressions, perhaps existing in a liminal space between the Three Tone Quintet recordings and the 1983 album that was yet to come.\n*EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm aware that all of these tracks, while being my work, exist with the original artists' names on them. Since it's been up to sixteen years ago now, I have long since lost my contacts with many of these very cool musicians. SO, if one of you has found this release and wants a copy for your contribution to it, PLEASE get in touch with me. It would be great to catch up anyway.",

            "about": "The long-stalled fifth volume of Plangent Liqueurs - Blue Green Bedroom Subtropic - arrives at the perfect time, at the terminus point of a long, weird Summer. Like the fourth volume, being concurrently issued, volume five revisits many landmarks from past identities and events, assembled here and remastered to perform as a cohesive and narrative whole. \"Surrounded By Pigments\" and \"Majik Melter\" sound plucked out of sessions for New Drugs and Colortone, while \"Ties Crews Emerging\" could have been a Bell'n Dither outtake. There are beautifully serene moments present here, such as the oceanic missive of \"Sounds From Shattered Seashells\" or the late-night ashtray jazz of \"Deliver\", and there are hyper-colorful manic jams that offset this calmness to a devastating rave-out effect, as on \"Oh Karelia\", \"Faith\" and \"Harmonic Ambiguity.\" The closing cut, \"Meadows\", presages Coppice Halifax in many ways, especially considering how transparent I've been through the years in admitting that Ourson's Warming Plant and Specimen Four Billion were instrumental in CH even being brought into existence (I will even go a step further and say for the record that 1983 was a response to Warming Plant, at the time). Perhaps most prescient of all is \"Arcus Current\", which today feels as if it is some kind of Sun Cast preamble to my ears. Altogether, these Plangent Liqueurs bring back a flood of vivid memories, friends and studios, and it is nice to once again have them published here in such a fashion.\n*EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm aware that all of these tracks, while being my work, exist with the original artists' names on them. Since it's been up to sixteen years ago now, I have long since lost my contacts with many of these very cool musicians. SO, if one of you has found this release and wants a copy for your contribution to it, PLEASE get in touch with me. It would be great to catch up anyway.",

            "about": "The sixth volume of Milieu remixes, and the first one in a while that is totally \"modern era\" Milieu, which means this series is finally back up to speed. Nine mixes that mostly inhabit a braindance and melodic acid landscape, with lots of squelchy sequences, fluttering lead melodies and bouncy water-balloon rhythms. That is not to say that these mixes lack subtlety, because they most certainly have their moments of restraint as well as technicolor overdose, but altogether here they feel like a dance party that's suddenly realized the evening is ending, and no one wants to go back home, but it's the end of Summer and school is starting again soon. There is a sense of disconnect and longing that only really lines up well with being a teenager, in a nowhere town, so to be quite honest I'm not totally sure why I'm in my thirties and still conjuring up imagery like this. Maybe it doesn't actually quantitatively contain any of those emotions, but rather, these kinds of tracks immediately pull me back to memories of sitting around in public transit stations after I dropped out of high-school, spending the small amount of cash I had on pointless bus tickets so I could ride around all day, slumped in a seat, zoning out with Polygon Window in my headphones, staring out a window, happy to simply be in the safety of that moment, going nowhere. It doesn't sound all that glamorous now, but without things like that, I don't know if Milieu as you and I know it would even exist. In any case it is always my sincere hope that these collections of disparate tracks work together to form a nice, cogent whole that feels more like an album and less like a cobbled together mess. All but the last two tracks were drafted specifically for bonus cuts on Recycled Plastics releases, and the final two were commissioned by Illuminated Paths for the very cool and very warped Noob Saibot tape.\n*EDITOR'S NOTE: I'm aware that all of these tracks, while being my work, exist with the original artists' names on them. Since it's been up to five years ago now, I have long since lost my contacts with many of these very cool musicians. SO, if one of you has found this release and wants a copy for your contribution to it, PLEASE get in touch with me. It would be great to catch up anyway.",

            "about": "Polypsilon, Part 1 is - as the title implies - the first half of two separate 60-minute cassette releases, and the first tape released at Recycled Plastics!\nAs a Milieu album, Polypsilon is possibly the most \"genre music\" type thing Milieu has done, filled with all the staples of feel-good braindance as well as my first foray into acid. The recording sessions were impulsive and tangential, and by the end, there was far more material than I was expecting to make, giving way to this two-part release.\nIt's probably a spiritual follow-up to Academy Stripes, although it should be noted that Polypsilon was intended to be a sidetrack thing, and not \"the next big new Milieu record\", so I guess consider it as a gigantic 2 hour EP.\nI can't really think about how to describe it, so I'll leave you with the music. There's lots of 606/707/808 drum machine action, as well as my usual soft spot for a couple breaks and my Korg ER-1, and the synths used include my Roland SH-32, Casio PSS-50 and MT-210, the wonderful Fahtacon softsynth made by my friend Robin and of course the Milieu go-to Lowrey Magic Genie organ, among other things. Everything was meant to be loose, sporadic, playful and tingly on the earlobes, so hopefully that comes through in the final result.\nRemember, this isn't braindance - it's BRIANDANCE!",

            "about": "Hot on the heels of Part 1 comes Polypsilon, Part 2! The second half of the BRIAN-DANCE odyssey is another hour of colorful electronics and bedroom production values. Arguably more diverse than Part 1, with krautrock influenced motorik tracks like \"Paul The Pylon\", jungle strains in \"Phallusaurus Jox\", a little Boards of Canada peeking through in \"Polly Epsilon\" and a nod to SAW 85-92 on \"P-Boots\". Of course, melodies are still the focus of the material, along with a nice settled in comfort level from working with so many familiar sounds and machines. The whole thing inevitably caves in by the end, and trails off along some long-lost ambient coastline from the depths of my mind. Printed and pressed on a super-limited special edition of 30 copies on white cassette tape, with hand-cut red cardstock J-cards and black text decals. Don't miss out!",

            "about": "At long last, the definitive edition of Milieu's bedroom wonderland Polypsilon! Collecting all 29 tracks from the Part 1 and Part 2 cassettes, and including four bonus tracks (Sofaphonk 89, from the cassette edition of PolyPlus, Acid Volunteers from the Acid Tryouts compilation, Golden Flake Theme from a super-rare web compilation and a previously unreleased ambient mix of Polly Epsilon), filling out two action-packed CD-Rs dripping with pretty melodies, expressive acid lines and drum work that runs the gamut from house and techno to electro and jungle. Inspired by classic music like AFX, Kerrier District, Ovuca and Bochum Welt, as well as modern favorites like Automatic Tasty, EOD, NN* and Mrs Jynx, Polypsilon is the first truly ACID Milieu effort, where only hints of the sound appeared before on albums like H Is For Hologram, Academy Stripes and Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker - guaranteed to tickle your eardrums and leave you satisfied, or exhausted, whichever comes first.\n\"Strung-out sci-fi synths to skittering drum machines with trance-inducing results\" -Columbia's Free Times\n\"This release is astounding\" -Cybertone\n\"Sounding rather sexy!\" -Some guy on a forum\n\"Spent the last of my wage on this, because Milieu never disappoints.\" -Another guy on a forum\n\"It definitely qualifies as acid.\" -Yet another forum post (Hi WATMM!)",

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe sixth volume, QUADRACID, was improvised and broadcast on January 27, 2018 at the White Pillar Workshop, exclusively for the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club. Doing what you might have expected from the title, Quadracid lowers the pH levels of the Workshop with 4x Korg Volcas / Korg MS-20 / Arturia Microbrute / Roland TR-505 / Boss DR-660 / Yamaha RY-20 and some well placed FX, across four distinct phases of technoid rhythms, filter squealing acid lines and crispy fried percussion. The fifth track, and closing section of the set, drops the club off a cliff and loses itself in a winding forest of delay pings, feedback trails and spaced out Quadraverb atmospherics. This one sounds great when pushed to louder volumes, and still lets you down softly at the end.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",

            "about": "Available for the first time on physical format! Quebrith & Yarrow is a record that might not have otherwise existed if not for my close friend John-Paul having a hard time getting back home after his mother passed away. Seeing John-Paul's need and wanting to help, I put together Quebrith as a gift to him, with my blessing for him to make as much money as he could with it to get him back home. I'm happy to report that he's made it home and he's slowly starting to put his life back together again - I wish him all the best. The tracks presented here were all made almost entirely live on hardware, with only the slightest editing and overdubbing on a couple tracks with a computer. Many of them were also created in hotel rooms, using a mobilized studio rig that fit into a blue suitcase and a green backpack, almost totally battery operated. As such, this album's consistency is a testament to the dependability of the gear I used to make it all, since none of these tracks were intended to rub shoulders together in this manner. Yet, here they are, and I find Quebrith is a very enjoyable listen for these hot and humid Summer days. Hopefully you do too.\n**This version of Quebrith also includes a bonus track (Summergliss) that is something of a sibling to Bluecarpet.",

            "about": "\"The euphony of the rustling meadow was my education; among the flowers I learned to love.\"\n-Friedrich Hölderlin, excerpt from 'When I Was a Boy' (1797-98)\n---\n'Quirinal Silver Boa' is the curiously named 19th Sleepbuilding release to be published for free. It is unique in its source - a deep exploration of a single-note sample from a fellow synthesist, integrated into the R-EW Audioholistics modular system and used as a molecular seed to generate the piece. It was originally broadcast overnight on May 26th, 2023.\nDue to the external sample usage that shaped this piece, 'Quirinal Silver Boa' is perhaps the most proof of concept broadcast to be included in this series thus far. It is highly illustrative of the worlds of variation that are possible with a deep-dive of modular processors, granular resamplers, and a large amount of filtering, equalization and reverberation.\nMusically speaking, 'QSB' is played in the Ionian scale, and offers a distinct sense of isolation - notes of sound blowing in a slow desert wind, becoming a dusky perfume as they mingle with the grains of Urth. Outlining surrealistic structures that hover in the air, between the dirt and the clouds, the melodic lines wander through almost-night darkness, and find us here, between waking and sleeping, waiting and listening for them.\nI would like to express my gratitude to S.A. for his friendship, lively conversations and of course for contributing his creative effort to the whims of my machines. This is a whole universe, grown from something too small to even see, and that makes it remarkable and unremarkable at once. It is a view of the peripheral that always exists, the horizon line behind the next hill, and I will never tire of the walk toward whatever we will find there.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "\"I am the Poem of Earth, said the voice of the rain,\nEternal I rise impalpable out of the land and the bottomless sea,\nUpward to heaven, whence, vaguely form'd, altogether changed,\nand yet the same,\nI descend to lave the drouths, atomies, dust-layers of the globe,\nAnd all that in them without me were seeds only, latent, unborn;\nAnd forever, by day and night, I give back life to my own\norigin, and make pure and beautify it\"\n-W. Whitman, excerpt from 'The Voice of the Rain'\nThe eighth published session from the \"Sleepbuilding\" overnight broadcasts, 'Rain Curtain' was generated and streamed online on February 17th, 2023 from the White Pillar Workshop. Running for almost twelve straight hours, this patch on the R-EW Audioholistics modular system yielded deep blue hues for sleeping and waking listener alike.\nPrimarily centered around the Karplus-Strong voice in Mutable Instruments' Braids module (otherwise known as PLUK), 'Rain Curtain' is a minor pentatonic scale explored via two Ornament & Crime modules - one running the Harrington 1200 chordal-triad algorithm and the other running Squanch, which is a simple but effective shifting quantizer - with timing information stemming from a complex trigger array of Missed Opportunities, a Doepfer clock divider and a Boolean divider (CMOS Party).\nMusically, it was somewhat patched alongside a particularly spirited rainstorm that was passing over my home (hence the title), with the patch providing an interesting counterpoint to the erratic thunder, metal windchimes on my porch and the white noise of the rainfall itself. The absence of all of these sounds and textures from the recorded piece, which is simply the isolated modular system's output, makes it a bit easier to recontextualize the work, which feels detailed enough that I never really get the sensation of missing a vital element when I listen to it now.\nThis release, like the seven others before it (links below), will remain free to download, and this is especially important to me because this particular stream was a much-needed respite after an incredibly difficult week in my personal life. I am happy to have these broadcasts, and the modular system itself, for the selfish purposes of facilitating a continuous balm in a recuperation ritual, and it makes me feel better in a selfless way to know that these recordings are able to reach others and accomplish this same purpose too, entirely apart from whatever guided my hand when I was plugging in so many cables. The Sleepbuilding broadcasts offer balance of self and anti-self, they foster connection through their disconnection. Here are twelve more surrealistic hours to color your days and nights with.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):\nMMD071 (Creation)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/creation\nMMD072 (A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-small-fire-in-the-snowy-woods\nMMD073 (Cirrus)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/cirrus\nMMD074 (Zephyrean)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/zephyrean\nMMD075 (Chiasmus)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/chiasmus\nMMD076 (Relief Upon the Landscape)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/relief-upon-the-landscape\nMMD077 (Hold Me in a Field)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/hold-me-in-a-field\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "\"Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,\nYou must travel it for yourself.\nIt is not far, it is within reach,\nPerhaps you have been on it since you were born\nand did not know,\nPerhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.\"\n-W. Whitman, excerpt from 'Song of Myself' (1892)\n---\nIt is another new year. Paradoxically it never feels different enough to be new, but we must always carve our lines of measurement into the world around us, and time is no exception. Despite this arbitrary nature of counting everything, I nevertheless feel compelled to begin each year with a defined statement - something that exists in the Venn space between a meaningless resolution and a sincere sentiment - and in the spirit of this dual-purpose expression, I am content to offer you 'Recurrent Irrigation' as my best foot forward, as the saying goes.\nOn the technical side, 'Recurrent Irrigation' was originally broadcast on the evenings of November 14-15 in 2023, and was my first in-depth session work with the Moog Subharmonicon analog synthesizer. The two nights' patches explored Just intonation and 12-TET, with the aid of the usual tools in the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, and together they constitute the 21st Sleepbuilding release to be published here. (As usual, detailed patch notes are available in the 'track info' sections of this page.)\nAt the end of each year, I have made it an annual tradition to take some leave from my work, such as it is, starting on my wedding anniversary (12/16) and not returning until sometime in early January. This is less of a 'vacation' and more of a decompression, a bit of much-needed asceticism and radio silence during one of the busiest and most stressful times of the year. During this break, I spent a long time considering what would be my first published work of the new year, and although I knew it would be one of the fourteen unreleased Sleepbuilding broadcasts, I consulted the ever-illuminating I Ching to help me decide.\nThe I Ching sagely acknowledged my decision paralysis, and pointed out that I should not try to reach for any larger goals, and that it is just as good to work on smaller ones. It reinforced that even if I am returning to the studio for work in the new year, that I can continue to lay low and keep things simple. All of these notions led me back to the thematic details I'd been developing with 'Recurrent Irrigation' - a topical reference to the electrical current running through the many patch cables in my workflow, as well as a more pointed commentary on the branching paths and tributaries that continue to split off from the proverbial river of my creative work - how it is always the same and never the same, which I have written here several times before.\nI found that somewhere beneath the surface of these sessions was the idea I wanted to carry into this new calendar year, following on the strength of twenty prior extended sessions, acknowledging the path behind me while also renewing my understanding of why I was doing it in the first place. If you repeat anything often enough, the definition can become lost in the oscillation, initiatives can become rote exercises, so it can be fruitful to open up the machinery and re-evaluate the way things work from time to time, even if only to put the gears back together exactly the way they were, content in your assurance that the system does not need changing.\nSleepbuilding releases will thus continue, free long-form ambient music created procedurally, the recorded output of a machine that both inspires my curiosity and echoes my will, drawing a line through this map and carrying a current of peace and placidity in somnolent tones. There will always be another hill for the river to bend around, another undreamt landscape, so for this forty-first circumnavigation, I will follow the sun.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "\"These pools that, though in forests, still reflect\nThe total sky almost without defect,\nAnd like the flowers beside them, chill and shiver,\nWill like the flowers beside them soon be gone,\nAnd yet not out by any brook or river,\nBut up by roots to bring dark foliage on.\"\n-Robert Frost, excerpt from 'Spring Pools' (1928)\nWith the Spring season fully annunciated by windy rainstorms and sun-kissed green growth in equal measure, it is an apt moment to publish 'Relief Upon the Landscape', a nearly nine-hour ambient recording laid to digital tape in an overnight broadcast on the evening of February 16th, 2023.\nLike 'Creation', 'A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods', 'Cirrus', 'Zephyrean' and 'Chiasmus' before it, 'Relief' is a fully generative work, produced and performed hands-free by my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, with no external processing tools or augmentations. It is music that exists as the manifestation of many dozens of my own compositional decisions, accumulated into a network of controlled voltages, which combine in a designed arrangement that writes \"one minute of music in one minute of time,\" as Bill Evans was fond of saying about improvisation.\nMore and more, I have enjoyed the fruits of my modular patches so much that I've opted to allow the public a voyeuristic awareness of their sound as it unfolds in my studio. For what is ultimately a tangential and highly experimental process of designing sound, I find it impressive how truly accessible these recordings can become, which leads me toward repurposing them as holistic broadcasts of soothing and sleepy ambient music, sound as a utility, and this of course then forms an ouroboros as it factors into my creative decisions when I sit down in front of this strange machine and decide how it ought to function.\nI sincerely hope you find some relief in your own landscape, with this recording, because mine is filled with suffering and darkness far too often, and so I use my machines to push back this negativity, to fill the void with somnolent waves that can carry me away from the modern world and all of the terrible things within it. Spring is here, and with it, a colorful and vibrant reminder that the world keeps on moving and growing, perhaps even more than it becomes still and recedes. It should be celebrated to know that change is the only constant in our lives, that \"bad times are just times that are bad,\" to quote a fortune teller I know. As I have mentioned alongside broadcasts such as this one in the past - let this work be my contribution to that conversation.\n----\nAll prior 'sleepbuilding' broadcasts to date remain FREE to download:\nMMD071 (Creation)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/creation\nMMD072 (A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-small-fire-in-the-snowy-woods\nMMD073 (Cirrus)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/cirrus\nMMD074 (Zephyrean)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/zephyrean\nMMD075 (Chiasmus)  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/chiasmus\n----\nThe original YouTube broadcast of 'Relief Upon the Landscape' is available to stream without breaks here:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiXwzDSbHm8\nFor more generative ambient music delivered monthly to your Bandcamp collection, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Digital reissue of the limited edition version of Remodelled, originally released in a handmade 4x3\" CD-R set at Boltfish Recordings (UK) in 2007, in a pressing run of 50 copies. A secondary, single-CD-R version of the album was also made available on a slightly larger pressing, but the 4x3\" version featured two additional tracks (Rain Metre [Acid Edit] and Smokestacks), as well as an alternate track sequencing (the album was split into four EPs) unique to the four different \"sides\". Both versions have been out of print for years.\nMusically, this album consists of alternate versions of tracks from other Milieu (and Parallax) releases up to that point. While recording for any one album, it wasn't uncommon for me to lay down multiple \"takes\" of a song, and in the case of Remodelled, many cases show that these are versions only in name and mood, but otherwise are completely different tracks, thus my choice to use the term \"remodel\" and not \"remix\".\nA1. As Summer Blooms\nOriginal version appears on Songs We Found In The Sand.\nA2. Thrum\nOriginal version by Parallax. Appears on Blisschord.\nA3. Elep\nOriginal version appears on Songs We Found In The Sand.\nA4. Cumulus Drones\nOriginal version appears on Simple Stations Repeat.\nA5.

            "about": "Remodelled came about organically as a concept as early as 2004, when I first started the practice of tangentially exploring my own tracks in the form of radically different mixes, alternate arrangements or even just rewriting the track altogether, while still keeping the same sonic template in mind. As such, I've always held that Remodelled is not simply a collection of outtakes or remixes, rather, a mirror-universe peek at what certain pieces of music I've written might seem like in another life. Remodelled isn't about purpose so much as potential.\nSo, that said, many of these tracks I feel are not quite as good as their \"official\" album track counterparts, while others in the time since their creation have gained my favor over the tracks I chose to release in their stead. The amazingly generous guys at Boltfish Recordings in the UK put Remodelled out back in 2007, in not just one but two unique editions - each with different packaging and track sequence, so that Remodelled itself was also Remodelled. By 2007 though, the album still went under the radar a little, because I had already mostly moved on from many of the sounds and approaches the album contains (the fact that Remodelled was completed during 2005 and 2006 didn't help), but label schedules and budgets are what they are, and I am still to this day thankful for the fact that such a conceptual and potentially overlooked album got issued at all.\nIn the time since then, Remodelled has been disparaged by critics while simultaneously being celebrated by fans. I don't understand it, I probably never will. To me, it is simply another foundational facet of what Milieu was and still is all about. It was never an exception to the rule or a tangent I chased down and failed to fully realize. So I kept making tracks and remodelling them in this same fashion, which is where the expansion for Remodelled comes in. A second hour-long disc of fifteen tracks, mostly b-sides, rarities from various homes and outtakes, including three previously unreleased tracks that I only ever played live once, then tucked away in my closet.\nThe whole double-disc affair has also been remastered from the ground up with the master recordings, which took some real digging to find, as I'm not exactly known for my organizational talents. Everything sounds bigger and bolder than it originally did, and that, I feel, makes the album far more interesting and dynamic. Many of these tracks were recorded at a time when I still got intimidated by an equalizer, and tended to embrace very conservative (and unorthodox) midrange-heavy mixes. So this is Remodelled as you and I have never heard it before!\n\"Remodelled is remarkably coherent.\"\n-Igloomag\n\"The unspoken but palpable underlying feeling is that the artist who releases, say, twenty albums a year is viewed as somehow less worthy than those who issue one every couple; such an artist is not just less worthy, but downright suspicious\"\n-E/I Mag\n\"What does it all mean? More nice melancholic melodies, more excellent dry beats\"\n-Electronic Desert\n\"If someone had played me a random track from this CD a few weeks ago then I probably would've thought that it *was* Boards of Canada apart from the fact that it's slightly less interesting.\"\n-Heathen Harvest\n\"There's no denying the album's overall quality but there's no denying either the overly derivative character of the music.\"\n-Textura\n\"...ambient doodling set against the mild rhythms, sauced up with some extra reverb to gain some extra, artificial, depth...\"\n-Vital Weekly\n\"Remodelled is my favorite album of all-time\"\n-Gary Busey",

            "about": "Retraced Paths is a double-album collection of beatless Milieu recordings, dating between 2016-2020, which includes three previously unreleased pieces from my archives. \"In A Vale Of Soft Green\" and \"Dithent\" are both more current recordings, drafted for Lee Norris' Neotantra label in the UK, while \"Panic, Across Fields\" was a pre-Daughter session track given to Luxury Sky District's 4/20/'96 compilation on double-cassette. \"Quomb\" was a generative piece created on the Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer for Dusk Transmission at Moody Drones - previously digital-only and presented here on physical format for the first time. \"Meristem\" and \"Peranimand\" were both, like \"Panic\", pre-Daughter session recordings that were realized just before the full grasp of what Daughter's process should be became clear, and neither have been issued anywhere prior to this. \"Thandminexas\" is another one from the vault, recorded in the anguish-filled August of 2019, at the same time as Four Passages For Faun, Tin Bell and Lyre. It was considered for release as \"Passage Six\" but this was abandoned in favor of Passage Five feeling more resolved and final at that moment in time, so it appears here as a massive second disc addition that both reflects the other six pieces on the first side, and contrasts against them with deeper realms of drone and sustained-tone bliss.\nAltogether, these seven recordings feel unified in many ways, not just because they originated from the same studio and sometimes, the same equipment, but in some deeper, unspoken way that can't really be quantified without simply listening. It is my hope that assembling them here creates something that is more substantial than the different parts themselves, and reaches across the time(s) and space(s) between us to offer some comfort and warmth as the Winter of a long, hard year approaches.",

            "about": "In the end of 2009, the label released three EPs of the namesake milky analog love music that Milieu has become emblematic of since 2004. Reverb Microcoma was a fun set of carefree melodic electronic songs, intended to convey a laid-back attitude and more-obvious-than-not nods to several heavy musical influences.\n\"Naptime Singalong\" was a catnap in Mrs. Jynx's colorful pastures. \"Sunlighter\" was a happy hug for Bochum Welt's \"Hug Me Tight\". \"Coming Home\" was a slowfade high-five to Casino Versus Japan. \"Melted Radio Tape\" was my fantasy of stealing a cassette from Freescha's sexed out 70's muscle car (for the record I don't even know if they have one). \"Night Camera\" was even recorded when Am-Boy visited to hang out and listen to my Jandek LPs, and bears some resemblance to his earlier works in its copious use of detuned flute melodies.\nThese three EPs quickly went out of print, off the map and under the radar, and the songs contained on them have since become some of my favorite Summer listening. In the spirit of supporting this music with a proper reissue, the original tracks have been combined and expanded with eight previously unreleased songs from that 2009 Summer, clocking in at almost exactly 80 minutes. This reissue should please listeners and collectors who missed out on the original EPs, as well as seasoned Milieu aficionados who will enjoy the colorful unreleased material collected here.\nAdditionally, this reissue is the second of several to appear in a new catalog subset called Arboreal Digest. This is #6 in the set, with other out of print/scarce Milieu and Coppice Halifax reissues following suit.",
            "credits": "released July 25, 2012\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at 114RKD, 2009. This is Milieu Music number AD6, and the sixth issue of the Arboreal Digest reissue series.",

            "about": "\"Mother rain, manifold, measureless,\nfalling on fallow, on field and forest,\non house-roof, low hovel, high tower,\ndownwelling waters all-washing, wider\nthan cities, softer than sisterhood, vaster\nthan countrysides, calming, recalling:\nreturn to us, teaching our troubled\nsouls in your ceaseless descent\nto fall, to be fellow, to feel to the root,\nto sink in, to heal, to sweeten the sea.\"\n-Ursula K Le Guin, \"To the Rain\" (2018)\n---\n\"River Daughter\" is the thirty-sixth Sleepbuilding release - originally broadcast live on 13th August, 2023 - and it consists of fourteen-plus hours of procedural music made with my R-EW Audioholistics modular system. It explores the inharmonic strings voice in Mutable Instruments' Rings, a Karplus-Strong digital synthesizer, which plays a constantly changing melodic sequence in the Marwa scale, prevalent in Hindustani classical music, and functionally utilized to convey longing during the sunset hours.\nThe monthly Sleepbuilding releases remain free, and tend to act more as utility sound-matter than music in any traditional sense, and I feel that \"River Daughter\" diverges slightly in its emotive quality, which never quite resolves the tangles of curious and dimly-lit melodicism that it continuously unspools. It reminds me a little of Eno's \"Neroli\" crossed with some of the FM synthesizer pieces of Jochem Paap's ambient FAX albums, and I think this sort of music is perfect for the warmer windy nights we're beginning to have here in the valley, with Springtime fully underway.\n---\nALL 35 SLEEPBUILDING RELEASES ARE FREE HERE:  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFOR MORE MUSIC IN THIS VEIN PLEASE CHECK OUT MY VIBRATELEPATHOS MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "FROM THE AUTHOR, SUMMER 2021:\nS IS FOR SLEEP was originally recorded for the consideration of Omni Systems, developers of the video game Eufloria, as supplemental soundtrack music for expanded and ported versions of the game in 2011. For a number of reasons, these tracks did not end up in the soundtrack, and instead found a cozy home next to the H IS FOR HOLOGRAM album. Three tracks of bedroom carpeted ambient techno, providing an encore and epilogue to HOLOGRAM's astro-funk acrobatics.\nToday, they have been carefully considered and remastered from their original session recordings, using fresh ears and futuristic tools that were not available when the tracks were laid to tape. They're just as cozy as ever, and the reissue includes several new additions, such as a revised cover design by Atoll Intercom Systems and a CD-only exclusive** deepspace excursion titled \"P-10\" that runs almost a full hour long, to let you down gently as you slowly drift into orbit again.\nORIGINAL COPY, 2011:\nDoes space seem big? Does the idea of traversing the 'verse seem like too much work? Then look no further. Presented in convenient pre-measured doses is all the space-sedative you'll need to get you through the long trip from here to H Is For Hologram. Simply break the seal of the plastic sleeve, insert the three-inch diskette into your stasis chamber's aural interface and enjoy. You'll be counting thousands of Z's and groggily landing on that lush, luxurious alien world in no time. Caution: Not tested on animals. Not for use on children. May be habit forming. If side-effects occur, consult your nearest Sick-Bay.\n**Supporters of the original edition of S IS FOR SLEEP are encouraged to check their Bandcamp collections for irregularities in the system code.",

After sitting on the shelf for a few months, I opted to do some augmenting to the original tracks and see where I could take them. A few hours later, I felt like I'd unearthed four rare gems and polished them enough to place them in ornamental displays around my house. A colorful blend of hardware and software with lots of creative FX processing and (perhaps unexpected) sampling, Sandgate in many ways brings back the psychedelic, tape-crusted funk of earlier Milieu albums. Sugar, and a little bit of toothpaste, for the eardrums.",

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe fourth volume, SATURDAY NIGHT LAZER, was streamed online as it happened to the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club on the night of December 9th, 2017. As per the usual with live-in-studio sets, Lazer was completely improvised using only hardware (look Ma, no computers!) and no overdubs. This set begins with a halfway pretty-halfway drunk analog polysynth melody, which quickly gives way to bouncing house kicks and percolating rhythmic textures. Being made using only four machines total - Korg Volcas, all - things mutate and deform and before we know it, it's a psychedelic acid dance party. Things get shaken up though, more than you might expect for only four devices, some FX and a mixer - the sounds weave in and out of Perrey-esque bleep-bloop melodic playfulness, woozy synthesizer space-outs and mercilessly tight Milieu funk.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",
            "credits": "released July 17, 2018\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Improvised and recorded live at White Pillar Workshop on December 9th, 2017.

            "about": "Heralding the start of a new sub-catalog at Milieu Music: The HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThe fifth volume, SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ARGENTINE, is a special set that was performed live-in-studio and broadcast online to the Milieu Music Fan Club as the last hour of December 31st, 2017 ticked away, with the second half of the set being the first audio I created in the 2018 year. For this New Year's countdown celebration, friends were invited into the studio, drinks and snacks were brought in and two hours of unreleased music were broadcast to the Fan Club leading up to the set, which was also followed by an Occur set of half-jamming/half-playing vinyl. You may notice that this set is markedly faster in tempo than the previous sets in the Housework series - this was decided upon beforehand, to break up any notions of \"comfort\" dialing it in, avoiding monotony as much as possible. (Fuck Mono Tony, we like Stereo Tony and his pals Quad Tony and Fivepointone Tony - ha!) What followed was a frantic cascade of acidic monosynths, bending and warping in all those wonderful analog ways, accompanied by a frenzy of manic drum machine panic attacks, spattered percussion and rumbling filter growls everywhere. Somewhere around the halfway mark, the Arturia Microbrute comes in with a patch that sounds almost like a lower register piano, playing a plaintive sequence that weaves in and out of more drum machine madness, reverb soaking and finally drops off into abject isolationist space. Not an inappropriate analog for the way 2017 felt for a lot of us starving artist types!\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",
            "credits": "released July 17, 2018\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Improvised and recorded live at White Pillar Workshop on December 31st, 2017 - January 1st, 2018.

            "about": "Earlier this year, I completed and released SHALLOW EARTH on my 36th birthday, a record that was (at least, in the beginning of its conception) meant to be a loose, easygoing and feel-good affair to hit the reset button with, after the completion of SUN CAST, an eight-year triple-album odyssey that bordered on an obsession by the end, in 2018. In the end of SHALLOW EARTH's production cycle, however, I realized I'd essentially made an encore to SUN CAST, this time pooling together even more topical and far-reaching influences into a brightly colored aural equivalent to cough syrup-spiked Ecto Cooler. If that descriptor works for the album, then you might describe this, the alternate-timeline PARTY MIX of the album, as some of DJ Screw's infamous \"purple drank\" with extra muscle relaxants and a couple tabs of blotter thrown in.\nI wanted to issue SHALLOW EARTH on an analog format, in addition to the CD-R at Recycled Plastics, and that's where the ever-interesting Illuminated Paths version came into focus. Never content to have the same thing simply on different formats, the decision was made to ask resident sound manipulator BROKEN MACHINE FILMS to have his way with mutating and re-presenting the album in his own unique mastering pass, which involved multi-generational analog overdubbing, copy-of-a-copy xerox style, with different cassette and VHS machines, and perhaps even more secret fidelity-warping magic that I am not privy to. The result elongated the album considerably, not just because a few extra tracks were included to fill out two tape sides, but because the pitch had become so affected that SHALLOW EARTH went from a dance party to a hallucinatory Percoset funk party, perhaps more properly echoed in the tired and apathetic expression on the face of the UK mannequin that graces the cover.\nAnd yet, this mix became far more than the sum of its process, opening up new spaces, flavors, grooves and colors in the tracks that weren't there before. I've always been a huge fan of playing my tapes and vinyl back at the wrong speeds, and this felt like a grand tribute to both 45-at-33 slow-mo and low battery Walkman bliss. A few of the songs even sound closer to the early Milieu sound from 2005-2007, so in some ways the PARTY MIX is an imagined take on what SHALLOW EARTH would have sounded like, had I created it way back then.\nNo matter how you decide to listen to it, it's clear that BROKEN MACHINE FILMS have completely reconfigured the entire SHALLOW EARTH experience, and for this effort I am quite grateful. This release appears here in digital format after numerous requests have come in for it, since the IP cassette did not include a digital version. Many humble thanks to everyone who purchased the tape, and if you're just now discovering this PARTY MIX and want to pick up a copy of the tape, there are still a few more at ILLUMINATED PATHS here:  illuminatedpaths.bandcamp.com/album/shallow-earth-party-mix-ip-cassette-exclusive",

            "about": "During the many Vibratelepathos sessions undertaken in the 2020-2021 period (see:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ), several sessions were distinctly kept apart from the series catalog due to their sound sources or processes overlapping with different session headers. Where the River Ores sessions focus solely upon exploring Karplus Strong synthesis, and the Red Lamps sessions all originate from the use of a Bliptronic 5000 polyphonic digital synthesizer, the two sessions presented here utilize both of these disciplines harmoniously.\nRecorded in April and May of 2021, Silver Ore and River Garden feel very much a part of the Vibratelepathos landscape - recordings that may never have been produced at all, if the Vibra series were not actively following the paths it continues to wander, with generative music and unorthodox modular synthesis remaining the focus - and yet, in many other ways, they feel almost like pre-Vibra ambient Milieu recordings, with passages and motifs that recall albums like A Dusty Box, Daughter, Transposition Gradients and Of The Apple.\nHowever listeners choose to approach these recordings, they remain versatile and utilitarian - able to be used for meditation, sleep aid, reading accompaniment, a substituted gaming soundtrack, warm bath soaks or even a backdrop for creative work like writing, design or programming. In this sense, Milieu music lives fully up to its name, as an element designed to become a part of a given atmosphere, ambient listening in every possible meaning of the term. I myself have slept, read, written and simply laid still with these pieces since their manifestation, and tonight, when my entire township is blanketed in snow, they feel apt as gifts to pass on for the wider world to enjoy.\nStay warm, be safe and relax.",

            "about": "Catalog number MML124 is an informal tribute to Botany Bay, my previous studio in Columbia. It is comprised of four distinct sections taken from a live set rehearsal, longform hardware funk jams that sound just as bedroom as they do club. Built in realtime using 4x Korg Volcas / Boss DR-110 / Alesis Quadraverb / Boss RV-3 / BBE Two Timer / JVC KD-A11 & a Peavey FX2x24 board, in conjunction with some selective software processing in post. Heavy, groovy, weird as hell, touching on many different aspects of where Milieu has been these last few years, as well as moments that could have easily appeared on the similarly-produced Coppice Halifax album Argentine Confiture. As the years go on, the lines between Milieu and CH continue to blur in certain spots, and I find that I really enjoy that middle ground when it happens. It always feels very fun, alive, spontaneous and hopefully that spirit of the performance translates via these recordings.",

            "about": "SINE WAND HONEYDOWSING is the second album in the HOUSEWORK series. This heading will be responsible for distribution of Milieu live sets, recorded from 2017 onward. Every set will be cleaned up and mastered, as much as possible, by The Analog Botanist's loving hands and ears, made presentable for both club systems and home listening rituals, maximizing enjoyment.\nThis second set was completely improvised and broadcast online as audio/video from the White Pillar Workshop studio. It was created using only four Korg Volca units (Keys, Bass, Beats and Sample), in conjunction with outboard FX like an Alesis Quadraverb, a Pioneer spring reverb box, a BBE analog delay and a Boss RV-3 digital reverb, all channeled through the able faders and paths of a Peavey FX2x24 mixing desk. The choice was made to index different tracks throughout the different phases of the set, in order to make it easier to navigate, although playback should still remain as seamless as it was when it was performed.\nMastering note: These recordings, and those that follow in the Housework catalog, were sometimes made so impulsively that there were less than ideal recording conditions present, such as ground hum, the occasional pop or click, etc. Every effort has been made to present the recordings as sincerely as possible, errors and all, with only as much editing as necessary. Please understand the raw nature of the performances is being preserved here above all else, and that sometimes means it retains some obvious flaws!",

            "about": "From the chilly basement studio I call the White Pillar Workshop comes a sporadic set of Milieu trax I've affectionately titled Sinewaves In Soft Focus. As it usually goes with Milieu these days, session recordings get so dense and complex and time-intensive for one album, so another album of \"easy\" music is usually soon to follow, something less scrutinized and more focused on playfulness and impulse-driven decisions. (If you're wondering, Housewares was the album in question - you should see the dozens of automation envelopes on each of those tracks alone!)\nSo, from an initial plan to generate fun quick tracks for a split with another producer, I inevitably got lost having too much fun, and it was decided that my tracks would be better issued solo. Each cut was made top to bottom in one evening of work, somewhat in the approach of the four releases I did for Project 168 so many years ago, where an entire release had to be recorded start to finish in one week (see: Simple Stations Repeat, Giants In The Desert, 1983 and Miniature Q Trax).\nThe thread of commonality running through these cuts is a set of low-res samples I made in 2003 of some throwaway Casio keyboard that ended up in my possession, and it will also be obvious to most seasoned listeners that I am having a blast with my Korg ER-1 all over these tracks too. There's some glitchy stuff going on here in spots, which is the side-effect of now having a small modular rig to process things in strange ways, but for the most part everything is very catchy and \"classically inspired\" along the lines of Rephlex essentials like Cylobian Sunset and Desktop Robotics, as well as things like the first Metamatics EPs on Clear, Jenkinson's Hard Normal Daddy and the perenially influential AFX shadow cast over a lot of my braindance stuff. There's also some obvious bits of leftover paint from Shallow Earth and Housewares, which only serve to keep things colorful and just familiar enough.\nThree tracks may seem a little more than familiar: Gentle Suburban Cares previously appeared on Cottage Industries 8 at Neo Ouija in the end of 2018, and finds an appropriate home here. Subgrade Mindless is a spiritual reprise of a very very old Milieu track that was featured on one of the many Bent Appletrees releases. Windy Fields At Dusk is an alternative mix of Wand 5 from Ambell Suns, originally cut at the request of a friend who wanted it to be longer and slower - it also felt appropriate to include here, given the sound palette and atmosphere. The rest of it is brand new Milieu, jammed out under this so-called quarantine. Several attempts to maintain daily sanity and happiness while the world literally burns down and withers away outside. It's a weird time, for me, for you - be safe, and don't forget to take care of yourself too. If there's no you, and no me, there can be no us.",

            "about": "Originally released as a promotional digital mix (in low-bitrate MP3 format) for the Milieu Mailing List in 2005, Sleeep Mmx has become a scarce remnant of those early days in the Milieu catalogue. It remains the sole appearance of several pieces of music, recorded with and without other musicians in the pre-Milieu years, and is presented as a seamless mix meant for dozing or reading to. Here, dredged up from over a decade of slumber on dust-caked CD-Rs, it's finally made once again available, complete with a high-resolution scan of the only physical copy ever produced, and sourced from the original masters. A fascinating tableau of Milieu tracks you know, alongside many tracks you probably don't.",

            "about": "If Songs We Found In The Sand was a set of training wheels for the Milieu project, Slow Lid Close was where the kid wheels came off and I went bounding headfirst into the future. SLC took everything I'd learned up to that point, and sort of distilled it down into neat little electronic pop songs. The music was intended to be playful and psychedelic but also very tuneful and easy on the ears, so SLC is very much a melodic overload of flavor and color. This album was also the first time I'd noticed a faster stride in my recording and writing - I was making more music, and I was making it more frequently, and little did I know at that time that this would be a trend on an upward arc that my creative tendencies would follow for years to come. So in that regard, SLC is the first real Milieu-in-the-wild moment. I'm working efficiently enough that I can be more impulsive with my ideas, less deliberate, and hopefully end up somewhere more sincere. The sound of this album is a graduated (some might say matured, I don't know if I'd agree) take on the sound palate from Songs We Found - a lot of detuned synths, funky drum breaks, overprocessed drum machines, \"in the pocket\" basslines (as David Tagg would later call them) and just enough texture and strange ephemera to make things feel more organic and less computerized. There's even prominent guitar on a few tracks - the faux-Hawaiian bent leads on Northern Lights, a pitch-bent loop groove on Trip, To and the super-depressed radio fuzz pickwork that leads Trainsong into the dark at the end of the album.\nAlso included as an addendum are the seven tracks from the Mint Slape Session EP, which were recorded at the same time as SLC. The Mint cuts are self-aware outtakes, a bit more experimental and meandering than their album counterparts, so please give them a bit more understanding if they sound drunk, or naive, or rude, or all three. Everything has been painstakingly remastered from the original source, and I don't mind saying that this is the best these tracks have ever sounded. The new cover photograph was graciously given to me by Rudolf Kremers, the genius behind the Eufloria games I've scored, and I think the pretty colors and understated subject matter echo the simplistic approach to electronic music that Slow Lid Close has. Hopefully it has aged as well as I feel it has!",

            "about": "\"Now the stillness relaxes, warmed to waking by a slow yellow sunbeam\nOpening the day with a long imperceptible inhalation\nConcealed beneath the withering leaves that cover the ground\nIcy blankets laid across the land\nNo longer uniform, giving way to a million tiny islands\nOverwhelming the snow into an evaporant retreat\nMigrating from the Urth to the blue atmosphere\nRepeating always this molecular oscillation\nAn outline of the process of life itself\nHere before me on this empty Winter day\nBut even if I cannot see it, I know it continues\nUnder and over everything, the true nature of the world\nSilent and ageless, the hills and rivers dreaming of the sky\"\n---\n'Snow Maps' follows 2023's 'Dusk Maps' in form and function, although musically offers an entirely different sound and texture. Using the same granular resampling processor that transfigured the Casio MT-210 into 'Dusk Maps' to instead process outtakes from the expansive 'Recurrent Irrigation' sessions with the Moog Subharmonicon, these seven tracks (laid out across two volumes) echo the still and white-coated Winter weather that has held me indoors for the last few weeks. They are presented here with as little pretense or context as possible - simple, pretty and ambient, nothing more or less. Music to curl up with while you dream of sunbeams thawing the sheets of ice and snow.",

            "about": "\"Now the stillness relaxes, warmed to waking by a slow yellow sunbeam\nOpening the day with a long imperceptible inhalation\nConcealed beneath the withering leaves that cover the ground\nIcy blankets laid across the land\nNo longer uniform, giving way to a million tiny islands\nOverwhelming the snow into an evaporant retreat\nMigrating from the Urth to the blue atmosphere\nRepeating always this molecular oscillation\nAn outline of the process of life itself\nHere before me on this empty Winter day\nBut even if I cannot see it, I know it continues\nUnder and over everything, the true nature of the world\nSilent and ageless, the hills and rivers dreaming of the sky\"\n---\n'Snow Maps' follows 2023's 'Dusk Maps' in form and function, although musically offers an entirely different sound and texture. Using the same granular resampling processor that transfigured the Casio MT-210 into 'Dusk Maps' to instead process outtakes from the expansive 'Recurrent Irrigation' sessions with the Moog Subharmonicon, these seven tracks (laid out across two volumes) echo the still and white-coated Winter weather that has held me indoors for the last few weeks. They are presented here with as little pretense or context as possible - simple, pretty and ambient, nothing more or less. Music to curl up with while you dream of sunbeams thawing the sheets of ice and snow.",

            "about": "Snowradius is the first new holiday Milieu recording since 2011's Swirling Tinsel Singalongs (itself a compilation of two previously recorded holiday EPs), an ambient triptych that significantly expands the chilly Winter atmosphere of Swirling Tinsel's \"Snowradio\".\nCreated using similar production methods as those employed on Accumulation States, Snowradius' three long suites are generated using extremely processed and reduced vinyl recordings of orchestral, choral and other Christmas music, smeared and melted down to the point that what you are perceiving is a temperature and blend of colors, with a very occasional and subtle chord change that might, in some rare case, recall a holiday tune from the past that you might recognize. These aural paintings are made complete by casting them over a carefully constructed backdrop of field recordings, from two different snowfalls 600 miles apart. Murmurs of fuzzed speech drip in and out of the haze like melting icicles, and cold air frames the deep ambient vistas with a subtle breath, barely visible in the cold.\nSnowradius is a massive triple-album set, designed to calm and comfort the stressed holiday listener for bedroom or headphone playback applications. Mixed at a modest level, these pieces can be used for warm Winter sleep, late night reading or fireside intimacy, providing only texture and tonal color to accent the relaxed environment of your choice.",

            "about": "Bouncy sproingy bubbly new Milieu jams for Spring! Fashioned entirely live and using only the tastiest hardware ingredients, Soda Can Acid pulls melodic toe-tapping funk out of old Roland gear like the TR-505 and 626, new staples like Korg's Volca Keys & Bass and the monster floorshaker Microbrute from Arturia. Two tracks to turn your bedroom into a dancefloor, then one beatless cut for dialing things back down to a comfortable level. Burned and stamped into three inches of digital disc spinout, for your portable pleasure.\n**Includes bonus alternate artwork, prefabricated for all your Milieu cat meme needs.",

            "about": "Fuzzy childhood memories, hot summers, tape degradation via \"sunbathing\" my cassettes on the back dashboard of my car, childish misspellings and non-word words, soft melodies over harsh drums, introspective psychedelia, even more introspective ambience, making a crappy Casio keyboard sound novel. These are just a few of the key elements that were in my mind when I recorded Songs We Found In The Sand in the sweltering summer of 2004, all of them seemingly unrelated but still carrying some kind of mental weight and as yet unfulfilled importance to me. I didn't know what I was doing, but I sort of knew what i wanted to do, and working toward it felt more right than any of the previous bands I'd played in from 1997 onward. So, listening to Songs We Found today, it certainly bears its share of naive moments - an unassuming fragile baby ego is coming into being, one that doesn't fully know what it's about yet. Milieu was a cool new name for a cool new project of mine at this point, and I hadn't quite cut my teeth on it enough to realize just how much music this project would really yield. While the album is scatterbrained, piecemeal and at certain points (for me) barely listenable, I've done my best to clean it up and make it presentable here, because it's important still. It was not only the first Milieu album with beats and melodies, but it was the reason I met so many talented people who helped inspire it and ended up inspiring later works too.\nIncluded here is the original album, remastered from the original session recordings, and three additional cuts - Colorful Waves Go Up and White Sunshine, which were both recorded at the same time, but left off for some reason, and the original unedited version of As Summer Blooms, complete with an extra 2 minute song sewn onto the ending as a reprise of sorts. Three remixes also appear as bonus material - a Galerie Stratique assemblage of three album tracks, which is really a fantastic track even today, and two Clayton's Hideout-era remixes by Am-Boy, whose Floridian album helped inspire many of the melodies on this album.",

            "about": "STANFORD TAURUS is the first of two supplemental EPs to follow the STELLAR DEBRIS album. It contains seven tracks not included on STELLAR DEBRIS that originated during the same recording sessions. In some ways, the material offered by STANFORD is both more angular and more subdued than the LP tracks, providing further windows of context for the tangential creative process that produced them. For those of you not looking for details: STANFORD TAURUS is another seven tracks of space-age electronic music, designed to delight and distract both fixed and free-form attention spans.",

            "about": "\"Milieu is Brian Grainger, a prolific Impressionist from the subtropical southeastern US. With about a dozen monikers and nearly five-hundred releases behind him, his growing body of work continues to mutate, seemingly with a mind of its own. STATUETTES is his debut for Txt, an ambient work in two halves, leading the listener by the ear through the mind's eye and into the surreal and colourful arboretum of Brian's atmospheric fantasies. At times, light and airy, at others, darker and isolated. Always melodic, always with a sense of gravity and time having slowly worn away the chiseled edges of his monuments, presented here in soft sadness. Limited to 150 glass mastered CDs.\"\n-Txt Recordings",

            "about": "Statuettes, Part Two - five years fabled and finally here, a balm of pleasant ambient escapism from the abyssal world outside. Originally planned to be issued after Part One at Lee Norris' Txt label in the UK, the world moved on a bit, as it always does, and Part Two was displaced. Together, with Part One, these two albums represent a very personal level of happiness and achievement for me, as ambient music goes, but also as composition goes. I've written a lot of melodies since I first picked up a guitar in 1997, and I really feel that some of the best ones are on the Statuettes recordings.\nThe influences are probably obvious - the perennial Selected Ambient Works II, Jochem Paap's two beautiful albums on FAX, Ourson's Warming Plant, Irv Teibel's Tintinnabulation and so many others that I've visited and revisited for the better part of two decades. Given those things, the focus here is on warmth, melodic approachability and expressive environments that are gently coaxed out of rigid sequencers with a light hand. Some pieces incorporate microtonal elements, hand-tuned sounds that were played back in an unorthodox way using old samplers, while others are voices of analog and digital synthesizers, processed through filters, cassette tape, sunlight.\nThere isn't a lot to really say about Statuettes, beyond that I want these two albums to be considered as ambient compositions designed for pleasurable near-wakefulness. They make total sense to me in that liminal space between levels of awareness and sleep, when you've re-read a sentence on a yellowed paperback page five times and it still doesn't register that you've read it at all. When you're there, but you're not really here. These pieces each offer their own explorations of a scene, perhaps a garden, or a riverside, or a bedroom with a dim light, or an empty hotel lobby, or none of these things. Through the rounded tones and pillowy textures, an easy chair can become a cloud, a bed can become a waterfall, a quiet neighborhood can become a church.",

Well, clearly my memory is made of the rotting swiss cheese that it feels like between my ears, because not only was the entirety of STELLAR DEBRIS waiting for me to materialize it, but two additional EPs as well (which will be released in August and September, respectively).\nInitially, I approached the material somewhat cautiously - finishing music that I started so long ago comes with its own sets of rules and requirements, in order to not lose the focus of what the original idea may have been - but after spending some time with these compositions, the feel-good endorphins came flooding in to the studio, in big technicolor waves of synaesthesia, and it was decided that any such rules surrounding outtakes from a decade ago ought to be thrown aside in favor of simply having fun with it, so STELLAR DEBRIS is very much a first in the large and long-running Milieu catalog for this reason. It exists with spacesuit boots in both worlds, in both times, a bridging of the past and the future of that past, a musical handshake between two time-travelers moving in different directions, meeting up for a quick coffee between systems.\nSo, the question for the listener to answer becomes the following: When you press play, are you listening to Milieu in 2010-2011? Or are you listening to Milieu in 2021? Is there really a difference, that my ego would prefer to believe is present? I guess if there's no difference at all, that means only two things are possible: 1) I have the subconscious ability to revisit my past lives, slipping into roles that I have long thought were done and over with, or 2) I haven't changed or grown nearly as much as I would like to think I have, and that this exercise is all just one big cosmic feedback loop, coming full circle in the most elaborate and melodically accessible ouroboros ever.\nOr is it a third answer, an even more all-encompassing possibility? Are all the things I've worked on, and \"made\" by the terms and definitions of the role I've played as a man inside a room with synthesizers, inevitable? Are these pieces truly the stellar debris that I have named them? Floating in the ether, possible pasts and possible present, all at once, peripherally existing like Michaelangelo's statue, waiting to be exhumed from the slab of stone. I'll tell you, for my part in all of this, it's hard to feel like I'm not breaking my swiss-cheese brain just trying to grasp it all.\nSo, let's all just sit down and tell ourselves that it's just a show, that we should really just relax while Milieu arranges and catalogues Stellar Debris. Get yourself comfortable, that play button won't push itself. See you on the other side!",

            "about": "Stray Trains comes from a somewhat foggy time in my creative sprawl, when I was newly married, living in a tiny room in the back of my inlaws' country house, sleeping all day and making tracks all night on two absolutely awful desktop computers in a small corner next to a closet. During this time, in the Summer of 2005, we moved into the place where my Rolling Knoll studio would take root, and the rest of what became Stray Trains was recorded there. Going back to material from this era is difficult for me because I was learning new things and exploring new ideas constantly, which resulted in a lot of music being recorded but very little of it being recorded with fidelity in mind. As such, Stray Trains is home to many moments of clicks, pops, digital distortion and mixing decisions that I'd stop myself from doing less than a year later, but you learn by making mistakes, not by hitting the bullseye the first time you use a bow and arrow, so Stray Trains is forgivable in this light.\nI've done my best with the tools I have now, to clean up and somewhat clarify the music itself, fifteen years later. It almost doesn't even feel like I'm listening to my own music at this point, while other very specific parts recall vivid memories of staying up super late, sampling drum breaks on Prince and Kraftwerk albums, watching Michel Gondry videos and posting ridiculous shit on the long-gone Experimedia, Earstroke and Metanoia Media forums. The music reflects the time, a playful but also bittersweet atmosphere with elements of what I hoped would show Milieu in a more \"dance music\" mode at that point. Milieu had already recorded things like Slow Lid Close but not yet finished Night Currents, so Stray Trains illustrates aspects of both of those things quite well.\nAnother point to mention, is that Stray Trains was made specifically with Luke Hazard and his Earstroke Records label in mind. Luke has always been a part of the Milieu orbit, a brilliantly creative mind that has influenced much more than credits or copy might imply - he was the handshake between myself and Jeremy Bible, linking us up to release Gunkajima and Slow Lid Close...he did original design work for Slow Lid, and other Milieu releases like Simple Stations Repeat and Three Tone Quintet...when my ambient albums like the Milieu self-titled and Beyond The Sea/Stars manifested, Luke did beautiful paintings for all three. He provided Polaroid photography for Of The Apple, A Warm Wooden Hollow and several other releases at Second Sun and Install, and here on Stray Trains, he appeared in a collaborative musical role for the first time ever. The track \"Drain\" was made using melodic elements Luke had sent me as file transfers, and \"120 Free\" was created in a similar fashion with single-chord samples of an organ Luke played and a couple drum breaks he'd sent over. I am mostly certain that we'd discussed a lot of plans for a full album collaboration, and for one reason or another, it just didn't manifest (or did it?), but Stray Trains still stands as an affirmation of the work we did together.\nRegarding the expansions included here, all tracks except \"120 Free\" have been previously released before now, in various places. Two alternate versions appeared on Remodelled at Boltfish, outtakes cropped up on different volumes of the Bent Appletrees series across years. The reason these pieces were included here is not because they were all from a singular traced session, but rather, they all resemble each other in several ways, and were recorded within the span of about a year, with the earliest being \"Summer Islands\" cut in late 2004 and the latest being \"Biketrail 2\" in Autumn of 2005. After going back through early demos and master disk backups to assemble this reissue, it became clear to me that Stray Trains was much more the pursuit of an idea or a feeling rather than a strict attempt at specific songs, as many tracks that ended up released under other names later on were tagged in some way to be included on Stray Trains - things like \"My Friend The Dawn\" on Our Blue Rainbow (which, coincidentally, Luke remixed) and even \"Sway Leaf\" on the In Hills Made Of Clouds EP (also released at Earstroke with the first-ever Milieu stickers!). The cuts included here all feel very much in unison with the time and place and horrible desktop computer workflow they were made with, so it is my hope that the mastering I've done has helped to unify them that much more.\nAltogether, this reissue sits well alongside other similar collections like Foxhill Pastels or Sun Bleached Piano, where these blurry recollections of sporadic creative seasons have a pretty bow placed upon them, offering them up for modern consideration and nostalgic listening. Hopefully, these old tracks are not without purpose or joy in the current age, and find their way into car stereos and headphone walks for many sunny days yet to come.",

            "about": "The newest material to get the remastered reissue treatment is the 20-track collection SUN BLEACHED PIANO, containing works from 2006 to 2008.\nStarting with the IN HILLS MADE OF CLOUDS EP, from #1-6, it's evident that this music was Milieu's teeth-cutting on the sampled-breaks and weathered organ melodies aesthetic that later appeared on OUR BLUE RAINBOW, NEW DRUGS and came to a close on COLORTONE. Originally issued on a limited edition 3\" CD-R at Earstroke Records in summer of 2006, these tracks also shipped with the first-ever Milieu stickers! They've been carefully remastered at Botany Bay, to bring out the finer details while still remaining plump and pleasantly bouncy for your stereos to vibrate to.\nBridging the gap between HILLS and the next release included here is the track AEROLINE, which was originally recorded in 2005, only to sit unreleased until Metanoia Media issued an updated recording of it for their 50th catalog release compilation in autumn of 2007. The original version contained samples of a pinball machine, although the final cut of the track presented here is a much more traditionalist affair with moody organ lines and sparse drum machine punctuation.\nFrom #8-15 is the PILLOWTONE POEMS EP, initially recorded as a half-joke birthday present for my mother in law, who would always try to annoy me by asking when I was going to name an album after her. As such, PILLOWTONE was recorded from start to finish in about a week on a really terrible Compaq PC that was retrieved from an insurance office that was auctioning off their old machines. It too benefits greatly from the much-deserved remastering treatment applied here, retaining all the nuance of the melodies and effects processing in the original tracks, but being filled out with a depth and weight the tracks never seemed to have until now. This EP was originally issued at Milieu Music in 2006 as a simple papersleeve CD-R, then got an expanded second run at Unlabel for their Series 52 catalog later that year.\nTracks #16-18 were three bonus unlisted tracks included on the Unlabel edition of PILLOWTONE POEMS. They have always had names, but I've never mentioned them until now, because it's fun to keep secrets. The track SLOW BLUE NIGHT shares a melodic motif with the deep cut RED BALLOONS OVER A BLUE SHORE, which was recorded during the NEW DRUGS sessions and left off, to later appear on BENT APPLETREES 6. DREAMBOAT 2, as the name implies, is a reprise of DREAMBOAT, from the self-titled MILIEU album.\nFinally, closing up the disc are two selected live cuts, the first being a dirty and playful rendition of SLOWFADE HIGH FIVE, performed at the Lab 30 festival in Augsburg, Germany back in autumn of 2007. The second is a performance of the OUR BLUE RAINBOW cut RAINY DAYLIGHT, played for a creaky country house full of sleepy people in Cayce, South Carolina back in 2006. It was the closing piece of the set and you can laughably hear me remind everyone afterward that the set ended, so they could pick themselves up off the floor. These live recordings were compromised by low-fidelity recording setups, so please be aware that although the greatest care was taken to remaster them, they exist as artifacts before they exist as pieces of music.\nAdditionally, a previously-forgotten live set recording from 2006 surfaced while searching for the masters of this material. It's been released as a companion piece to SUN BLEACHED PIANO here:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-birch-park",

            "about": "SUN CAST is the result of eight years of recording work, which began life as a Coppice Halifax album in the Ocean Lion series. Over time, and through several changes in my creative and family life, I realized that I was actually writing a Milieu album. The two projects have always been grown from the same sun-kissed soil, and certain albums have blurred the lines drawn between them - Sun Cast is such a project, and possibly the most unique one to sit on that fence. (For those more inclined to watch/listen than to read, I have recorded a vlog video where I attempt to explain and contextualize this album:  youtu.be/9UNHmTXcwhU  )\nRather than think of my creative work as a compartmentalized, strictly separated set of colors/shapes/sounds/places, Sun Cast asks the listener to consider that Milieu, Coppice Halifax and all the other monikers I've used are themselves only vessels, each navigating a different part of a great ocean. This ocean's water has many elemental aspects about it - it might meet smiling faces and warm sands in a blue-skied tropical paradise, when Milieu is navigating. Or it could end up beached on a distant, isolated island, covered in mountains, valleys and hairy green forests, when Coppice Halifax takes the helm. Further still, Vhom inhabits a cold abyss of Lovecraftian black noise, further down than the Mariana Trench...and the plaintive strummed guitars on Brian Grainger albums are themselves looking out longingly at the waves, held fast inland by the confines of youth and memory. All of the other facets and iterations of my artistic subconscious exist in this space as well, be they distant blinking stars, the drunken laughter of best friends or a haunted swamp backyard behind a small house in the country.\nAnd so, it is with this understanding that I ask you to consider Sun Cast as a rare opportunity to explore these alchemical soundwaves from two vantage points, instead of one. Like my obsession with Monet's paintings of the Rouen Cathedral - the same subject in the same space, transfigured by time and light every single day, and set into a frame by the same hands. Sun Cast is musical superposition - it is the new Milieu album, and it is also the new Coppice Halifax album. And when you listen to it, you will understand why it is this way - I didn't set out to do this out of indecision, or a lack of better editorial ability, and I couldn't convey the same sensation of depth and interconnection with my ideas if the Milieu tracks were separated from the CH tracks. The CH material on Sun Cast is not \"remixes\" or \"versions\", it is not bonus content or outtakes. Sun Cast is a straight line through a map that itself shifts from Milieu to CH and back to Milieu again for the duration of its trip.\nAll this text, and I haven't even discussed the music itself! I think many of you reading this far already probably know what to expect from something like this, but for those that do not - it is melodic electronic music, applied with cassette warmth, mutant jazz/funk break sampling, detuned synthesizers and a host of head-nodding drum machines. It is like tropical and humid sad synth-pop, blended with aspects of hip hop, shoegaze bands and psychedelic Impressionism, played in its own time, without trying to make itself palatable for radio or mainstream appeal. And yet, I feel that it is the most emotive music I've laid to tape in years, which could be owed to the time spent on it, or having become a father during the creation/gestation of the album. It is also built brick-by-brick out of many of my biggest influences, such as The B-52's, Freescha, GAS, Fela Kuti and all kinds of disparate sources of inspiration, such as a lake, an electric plant, an overgrown backyard, a bedroom with an open window, the backseat of a smoke-filled car, an old paperback...\nIn short, if you like Milieu albums like Swaying Palms or New Drugs, or you like Coppice Halifax albums like Ocean Lion or High Hawaiian Fog, then Sun Cast will really take you places. I hope you let it do what it has been designed to do, and if I'm right about that, we'll stroll on the sand, where the air and the land meet forever.",

            "about": "Sun White Sun, the third of three albums recorded as a nameless triptych of guitar-centric works, produced in 2006 without a computer. SWS was laid to tape live, with no overdubs, using only a single electric guitar, a Boss RV-3 and a Technics M11 cassette recorder. Recorded for the improvisational series Freed Music at Expanding Electronic Diversity, SWS was issued with the following text:\n\"Suffused with Milieu's inimitable, breathy, organic sound and virtuosic studio technique, Sun White Sun is another exceptional set of sound sculptures from a true master of the genre. Thick with harmonic resonances, at times it conjures waves of parched heat rolling off the ground, and others, a placid ice floe, seemingly motionless in space. It is the refraction of light through a diamond, viewed through a dreamy and communicative ether.\"\nFor this reissue, I've opted to refrain from a remastering job, even though initially I thought it might have benefited from one. Mainly, I find that SWS truly shines in the spirit of free improvisation, and to polish it up would be to somewhat miss the point. In lieu of a remaster, however, I've gone back to the original tape and utilized it to create a massive Coppice Halifax remix of the closing piece \"Buried\". Not unlike the CH rephrase of \"Inside The Sun\" I drafted for the A Warm Wooden Hollow reissue, this mix melts down the walls of guitar drone and submerges rhythmic and melodic structures inside the liquids. Sun White Sun was a landmark record for me at the time it was created, opening up new and exciting avenues in the name of what might be possible for a Milieu release, and if it didn't exist, there's a very large possibility I wouldn't have gone forward with Second Sun Recordings or VCV with David Tagg afterward.",

            "about": "Reissued in celebration of Milieu's 20th anniversary in May, and in anticipation of the third Sunbather's volume, forthcoming for that occasion. Both this and the second volume of Sunbather's are designed to be supplemental to the Butcher Block Andromeda compilation, which covers material recorded from 2004-2014 - the first ten years of Milieu as a project. As these tracks are all very formative, they are presented here as they were on the 2019 edition of Sunbather's, with no additional remastering work, in order to preserve an accurate representation of how Milieu has mutated and (hopefully) progressed through the years. More than an artifact, but in many ways not anywhere near as produced as my more modern work, Sunbather's offers a scenic ride through many dusty memories and their shameless nostalgia.\nNOTE: Trainspotters will note the absence of \"Stained Brown Pages\" as the original second track. This track has been replaced with \"Elep\" - another recording from the same era - because \"Stained Brown Pages\" actually appeared here in error after it was already included on Butcher Block Andromeda.\nOriginal 2019 liner notes:\nThis collection is the first of two I've assembled specifically for the Touched catalog, and it focuses on the earlier shapes of the Milieu sound, which began in 2004 and is now almost old enough to buy cigarettes. These are all old tracks, and for me, even older, because as many of you reading this know by now, Milieu moves through records at the speed of light. Many of them were recorded before fidelity was part of the workflow, and before \"mastering\" was even in my vocabulary. There's also a lot of obvious (to me) influences at play here - see if you can notice them. Martin has been a Milieu fan for almost as long as I've been at it, and this collection exists because of his enthusiasm and invitation. Hopefully, the music does not overstay its welcome, and offers both longtime listeners and newcomers a colorful experience, riding as sleepy passengers through the tropical hues of sunwarmed melodies, stoned funk bass and tape-rusted drums. The tracks presented here have also been selected to augment/expand the Butcher Block Andromeda album, a triple-disc 50-track 10-year anniversary set that already planted a flag in the sand for a \"beginner's guide\" to Milieu a few years back. There is no overlap with that set, so continue on dear listener! Colorful waves await!",

            "about": "Reissued in celebration of Milieu's 20th anniversary in May, and in anticipation of the third Sunbather's volume, forthcoming for that occasion. Both this and the first volume of Sunbather's are designed to be supplemental to the Butcher Block Andromeda compilation, which covers material recorded from 2004-2014 - the first ten years of Milieu as a project - although this second volume includes three tracks from 2016/17 as well. As these tracks are all very formative, they are presented here as they were on the 2021 edition of Sunbather's 2 (see note), with no additional remastering work, in order to preserve an accurate representation of how Milieu has mutated and (hopefully) progressed through the years. More than an artifact, but in many ways not anywhere near as produced as my more modern work, Sunbather's offers a scenic ride through many dusty memories and their shameless nostalgia.\nNOTE: The mixes of \"Tydol\" and \"Eagle Nebula\" included here are the 2022 remasters, a marked improvement upon the original versions included on the 2021 edition of Sunbather's 2. Many listeners will not likely notice a difference, but it was worth mentioning here that I'd decided to update this collection slightly.\nOriginal 2021 liner notes:\nThis collection is the second of two I've assembled specifically for the Touched catalog, and it focuses on the earlier shapes of the Milieu sound, which began in 2004 and is now almost old enough to buy cigarettes. These are all old tracks, and for me, even older, because as many of you reading this know by now, Milieu moves through records at the speed of light. Many of them were recorded before fidelity was part of the workflow, and before \"mastering\" was even in my vocabulary. There's also a lot of obvious (to me) influences at play here - see if you can notice them. Martin has been a Milieu fan for almost as long as I've been at it, and this collection exists because of his enthusiasm and invitation. Hopefully, the music does not overstay its welcome, and offers both longtime listeners and newcomers a colorful experience, riding as sleepy passengers through the tropical hues of sunwarmed melodies, stoned funk bass and tape-rusted drums. The tracks presented here have also been selected to augment/expand the Butcher Block Andromeda album, a triple-disc 50-track 10-year anniversary set that already planted a flag in the sand for a \"beginner's guide\" to Milieu a few years back. There is no overlap with that set, so continue on dear listener! Colorful waves await!",

            "about": "To celebrate Milieu's 20th anniversary, a number of retrospectives have been carefully curated and arranged. Following 2014's ten-year \"beginner's guide\" Butcher Block Andromeda 3xCD set is a second 3xCD volume, collecting material from 2014-2024.\nThe Sunbather's collections were developed following the first Butcher Block as supplemental sets, published at Touched UK in limited runs that went out of print almost immediately in 2019 and 2021. They appended Butcher Block with music that I felt was still notable, but wasn't able to be included, for one reason or another - and so it follows that with the publishing of Butcher Block Vol. 2, a third volume of Sunbather's Pharmacopeia has materialized too.\nButcher Block 2's three sides are color-coded to follow Byrne's beautiful edition of the first six books of Euclid - red, yellow and blue - so although Sunbather's 3 has been issued ahead of Butcher Block 2, it remains Butcher Block 2's unspoken fourth \"green\" side, collecting a varied array of cuts that run through the many shades of Milieu albums published in the last ten years.\nOf the fourteen tracks offered here, only one is previously unreleased: \"Autufugue\" - a two-minute vignette of solo analog monosynth, overlaid via four-track tape machine, recorded during the extensive sessions for a video game soundtrack that *should* finally see a public release this year. Aside from this, some tracks may be new to many of you, such as \"Into\" - a sprawling psychedelic dance cut from the High in the Middle album, which remains an exclusive release for the Milieu Music Fan Club at Patreon - or \"Burnt Violet,\" a compilation cut plucked from the final release at I, Absentee.\nAltogether, Sunbather's 3 is a vibrant collection of Milieu material that hopefully lands just in time for the Summer warmth creeping in at the end of Spring. Once again, gratitude is owed to Rudolf Kremers, who provides the fantastic photography on the cover, and to you, Constant Listener, for being on the path with me this whole time. It's been a crazy twenty years, and I quite literally could not have done this without you.",

            "about": "An unexpected EP that materialized in a live session, with no overdubs, and was mostly improvised. One of the first recordings I made using the Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer, alongside an Arturia Microbrute on bass, Korg Volca Beats/Bass/Keys/Sample units, a Teenage Electronics PO-12 and some outboard FX. It recalls many of my biggest musical influences, such as Casino Versus Japan, early Aphex and Freescha, and was a perfect atmosphere to emerge from the studio this past Summer. In the wake of the much labored over and long-winded Sun Cast triple-album, Sunday Meadow Blush is a simple and sweet walk through a flowery park on a quiet blue-skied day.",

            "about": "The first of two (or maybe three) singles from the forthcoming SUN CAST album - a new Milieu record that has been in progress for the better part of eight years. Weathering hard drive crashes, studio changes, relocation and the birth of my daughter in that span of time, the material presented on Sun Cast is very much what one might call \"classic Milieu\" in that it returns to the subtropical Summer melodies, chopped break rhythmic nod, warm tanned basslines and a melancholic wistfulness that you can't quite put your finger on. A special record that will hopefully delight fans of albums like New Drugs and Swaying Palms, as well as Halifaxian works such as Ocean Lion and Pink Acre.\nSUNLINE SAIL is a bouncy electronic pop bottle, eager for the Summertime months while being all too aware that they will be over faster than you'd like. Backed by two b-sides, \"Penelope Envelope\" being an outtake from the Sun Cast sessions and \"Briam\", which previously appeared on the 3067 Megs charity compilation, here's to twenty minutes of blissful Summer escapism, built to last until it's time to go back to school.",

            "about": "It was the Spring of 2008 when I recognized the need to bring Milieu, as a project, into Phase II, whatever that would actually entail. I felt that with records like New Drugs, Our Blue Rainbow and Colortone, I'd gone as far as I could go with the slower tempos, mid-fi production and woozy sad-happy melodies, and I wanted to make a Milieu album that was brightly colored with a different set of watercolors, tropical, more clean-cut EQ, danceable even. Swaying Palms coalesced from these ideas, and when it was issued in July of 2009, it was the first of its kind in my catalog. It's easy to look back at this album now, and see the paths that have branched out from it - the braindance, acid and glossy funk of H Is For Hologram, Academy Stripes, Polypsilon and Tidewater Petrol, the Analog Botany series, Pawleys Island and even Sun Cast. All of these records owe at least some of their approach to the new ground that was broken here.\nMusically, it is almost over-abundant with warm basslines, while the same detuned synthesizers that were staples on prior Milieu albums took on different shapes, both rounder and more angular. The copious use of filters and textured compressors is still present, but dialed back behind an ever-present groove, with many moments on the album seeming to burst at the seams with rhythmic spasms, effects freakouts and huge tidal waves of reverberated chords. There's a lot more dynamism at play than on earlier Milieu albums, which may have preferred to simmer and jam out on a riff for a few minutes, instead of building up crescendos and dropping major changes out of hard tonal shifts.\nMany different inspirations bubbled up to the surface here, such as Casino Versus Japan and Freescha (always somewhere in the DNA of Milieu records), Fieldtriqp's more uptempo work on People Damage, Aphex Twin's Gentle People remix and his Polygon Window LP, Signaldrift, Yimino, Mrs Jynx, Miles Tilmann's Yes & No LP, Magic Arrows and The B-52's. The album was also courted for a vinyl release at the now-closed Consumer's Research & Development label in Chicago, before being re-sequenced, mastered a second time and issued as MMD006. It was released alongside two EPs, Azurine Droned and Waverider, which contained outtakes from the sessions, and a bonus EP called Shade Versions was included with the first 25 copies sold.\nThis collection remasters and compiles all 13 original album tracks, all 10 tracks from Azurine Droned & Waverider and all 5 tracks from Shade Versions, plus the two tracks from the split EP with The Dandelion Council at Awkward Silence, \"Sad Summer\" from the EED's Summer Vacation compilation, \"For Naoya & Miho\" (a privately commissioned track for a Japanese wedding) and \"Missive\", a track recorded in Germany in 2007, which remained homeless for some time and, in many ways, was the first Swaying Palms track. 33 tracks in all, for an exhaustively detailed look at what these sessions really generated.\nAdditionally, for the listeners who would like the most complete Swaying Palms experience, I've assembled a third disc of ten tracks titled Palms Plus, which collects the first take of the album's title track, the Yearbook Version of Autumn Fog Lifts and eight commissioned remixes that were produced either right before, during or right after the Swaying Palms sessions. It augments the main album with what is essentially a whole other full-length's worth of Milieu tracks. There is no digital version for Palms Plus - it is only available as a bonus CD-R in the special Anniversary Edition of the reissue.",

            "about": "In exaltation of Spring, a new Milieu album becomes manifest. Anticipating the colorful blooms and exploding green from inside the bitter end of a very cold Ohio Winter, THALLINE DRESS offers a vibrant tableaux of melodic considerations to contrast against my chilly basement studio.\nLike the precedent BLURRY THURSDAY in many ways, THALLINE DRESS revisits much slower tempos that recall the very early days of Milieu, and remodels them in more modern portraiture with FM synthesizers like the Yamaha TX81Z and the Volca FM, cruising alongside analog staples like my ARP Odyssey, Korg MS-20 and Behringer's MS-1 (a cheap evocation of Rolands SH-101). The focus here is on ritualistically calling Persephone herself back into the world, beckoning her to crawl out of the ravine behind the White Pillar Workshop and breathe the first breath of new life into the '21 year.\nSpring has always been the most violent of seasons, brute-forcing expansion and overgrowth that ends only when the cold wind begins to blow through the valley again. THALLINE DRESS attempts to crystallize these visions of sun-kissed rebirth and renewal within a very Milieu palette, and as usual, I can never quite tell you what the next Milieu album will sound like until it actually happens. Here you will hear impulses firing and paths being re-tread, it's the same but it's different, just like always. As verbose as these scripts have become, I still feel horribly unequipped to define my work in tangible terms. It is my sincere hope that these rogue ladies in their green-blue robes conjure up beautiful visions for your ears and mind's eye within these recordings, potent and immutable sad magic as old as the Earth itself.",

            "about": "Thanks to everyone who attended the release party for The Flower to Disappear. It was my favorite one I've done so far, and it is all thanks to you.\nThis piece was patched and recorded especially for the listening party broadcast, with the intent being to essentially design and convey a picturesque landscape that could exist just outside of the album. Textures, scales, timbralities, pacing, all things that carry over from the sequencing and presentation of Flower.\nIt makes me feel hopeful and happy, it sounds vibrant and alive and sun-coated, and I hope that it sounds that way for you too.\nPATCH NOTES: The Consonance of Joy consists of a fully generative, hands-free modular arrangement. Two Buchla VCOs within a 258t module were routed into two low-pass filters - 2HP and Doepfer 121-3 - where they were modulated pre/post-filter by incommensurable LFOs (sourced from Dreadbox Ataxia/Utopia, Buchla 281t) and multed into two different FX processors (Strymon Magneto digital tape delay module and Mutable Instruments Clouds granular/probabilistic reverb), with stereo outputs from both machines sent into a Behringer 308 for quad panning. For triggers/clock, Missed Opportunities was used to generate four different random but subtractive trigger outputs, and these were sent into Ornament and Crime (on Quantermain pitch quantizer mode), which used them to convey two different major pentatonic scales, with the internal CV source from a fractal sequence of the interspersion A163253 (  oeis.org/A163256  ), and the same incommensurable modulation sources listed above were also sent as four different inputs to further animate the fractal sequences' attributes.",

            "about": "Originally broadcast on August 4th, 2023, \"The Day Erased\" is now the thirtieth Sleepbuilding session to be mastered and released. In several ways, \"The Day Erased\" is a sibling to \"Compline,\" the ninth Sleepbuilding broadcast - both compositions are studies of the 2HP Pluck module, a four-voice paraphonic Karplus-Strong synthesizer, although where \"Compline\" sounds more moody and uncertain, \"The Day Erased\" is more of a calming bliss-out (the former used the Aeolian scale, while the latter explores Gamelan tuning), making the two volumes a well-matched pair. For these reasons, a similar Kupka painting to the one used for \"Compline\" has been chosen for the cover art on \"The Day Erased,\" visually unifying both releases in no uncertain terms.\nI always find these sorts of incidental dualities fascinating as they organically crop up in my work. In some ways, things like this are perhaps emblematic of a deeper level of personal programming in my brain, decisions that will always be made in the same fashion, leading to similar results from self-same processes. Doing such things in the musical world runs the risk of becoming tiresome, but the older I become, the more I tend toward certain rituals that bring me personal comfort, and that thinking of course extends to the sounds that I shape.\n\"The Day Erased\" absolutely qualifies as one such instance, being a transparent shedding of the stresses of the waking hours, a willingness to simply lay down and turn off until the batteries have been sufficiently recharged. It renounces the immediate past, whatever it contains, and concedes to the curtain of the evening drawn across the day, as all things must eventually do whether they want to sleep or not. However, I might posit that sleep is all the more satisfying when you seek it out, welcoming with open arms this tired wall, your brain and body finished with its activities, now prepared for the long slow transmutation into something soft and quiet, poured down the slope of a hill in that sweet dark forgetting.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE): campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany\nNOTE: This recording contains a few spots of peaking/oversaturation inherent in the original broadcast that could not be completely removed.

            "about": "\"...now the mazes of this rugged heath\nTrace with your fleeting steps; who all night long\nRepeat, amid the cool and tranquil air,\nYour lonely murmurs, tarry: and receive\nMy offer'd lay. To pay you homage due,\nI leave the gates of sleep; nor shall my lyre\nToo far into the splendid hours of morn\nIngage your audience: my observant hand\nShall close the strain ere any sultry beam\nApproach you. To your subterranean haunts\nYe then may timely steal; to pace with care\nThe humid sands; to loosen from the soil\nThe bubbling sources; to direct the rills\nTo meet in wider channels; or beneath\nSome grotto's dripping arch, at height of noon\nTo slumber, shelter'd from the burning heaven.\"\n-Mark Akenside, excerpt from \"Hymn to the Naiads\" (1746)\n'The Flooded Vestibule' is the fourteenth Sleepbuilding broadcast to be mastered and published at Bandcamp. It was originally streamed overnight on February 18th, 2023, and was another tangential exploration of a Karplus-Strong synthesizer voice playing the Dorian scale. Notably, this was the same instrument and scale employed for the very first Sleepbuilding session, 'Creation' in November 2022, and yet 'The Flooded Vestibule' feels a world apart from it.\nFollowing on the thread of these considerations, the piece thematically reflects the sensation of being in a familiar place that has been changed in some way, thereby recontextualizing it, and its title illustrates this; a beautiful castle of white marble, decorated with alcoves that contain statues, cascading up a long spiral staircase dotted with plinths. In contrast to such a place, it has partially filled with sea water, coming in from some unseen peripheral ocean, and above us, where the staircase winds up so far that we can no longer see the top, we can hear birds and wind.\nThe conversation between the man-made and the natural world is one I've thought about quite a lot throughout my creative life, and delving further into the realm of modular synthesis and generative music has only compounded my fascination with these relationships. This castle, or any other, was hewn from stone held within the Earth, and no matter how long it stands, or is repaired during our lifetimes, it will inevitably become reclaimed by the Earth. I often invoke this notion as a creative mantra of sorts - 'The statue remains inside the stone' - and it feels apt here also, to acknowledge the impermanence of anything I could think to build, and to instead find contentment in what already exists in the world; the first great work, authored by no one, or at least no one who can be found today to explain their intent.\n'The Flooded Vestibule' remains still beneath the weather surrounding it, accepting the gently swaying blue water line as an old friend, or some long forgotten part of itself that has returned to both reclaim and itself be reclaimed. We are here too, interlopers in this epoch of unnamed and unrecorded music, suspended beneath the weight of this sublime moment, waiting for the next change, knowing it must come, whether we are witness to it or not.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "The Flower to Disappear is, as many of my albums have been before it, a confluence of ideas, themes and patterns, woven painstakingly together into a tapestry that is hopefully pleasurable and diverting enough that it betrays the utterly cartoonish amount of work that went into creating it. I broke ground on it last year, in an isolated session that produced \"Planet Everfree\" for a Cottage Industries compilation album, without quite realizing that I'd already begun writing the record. Sometime around my daughter's 10th birthday, I could feel it happening, and sensing the approaching work, rolled my sleeves up and dove right in.\nThe weeks that followed were filled with some of the most scatterbrained and wildly unhinged creative tangents I've obsessed over since perhaps Sun Cast, although, like having children, the traumas and stresses of the creative act become largely forgotten as you begin to gain some distance from the work, and were this not true, no one would ever make more than one record. The Flower to Disappear is so full of polymetric composition and incommensurable patterns that much of the definition of each melodic or rhythmic event becomes slightly eroded beneath the hazy surface of the final mix. Every song included here has been revisited a dozen times or more, overdubbed upon like airbrushed paint, melted down, reformed, broken apart and rearranged into something that hopefully conveys a pop music sensibility.\nDespite the dense and complex processes that went into creating this music, pop music was always the ideal goal - something accessible, easy to listen to, topical and relatable - and although pop music does not tend to be a regular aspect of electronic music most of the time (at least in my own experiences), I find that pop music's general method of directness is a useful tool to apply to electronic music's unbounded and experimental nature. For example, imagine your favorite drummer. Then, imagine what they may have been able to accomplish if they were able to operate in not only the percussive force, punctuation and decibel-level domains their instrument exists within - what if they could affect pitches within each drum hit? Glissandos? What if they could reverse their kit like samples in a sampler, or sporadically shift the texture, fidelity and stereo placement of the instrument?\nI don't know if I've managed to accomplish any of this, at least as it appeared to manifest in my mind. I think that, 1000+ releases down the line, I have become more and more content with each album being what it wants to become, allowing myself to be less and less uptight about the \"what\" of the work and focus instead on the \"how\" of the work. So here we are again, as we always are, me orating out into the blank white void of this digital space, hoping that somewhere, you're listening, or reading, or remembering - perhaps all three. If you are, there is really only one message I'd like to impart with The Flower to Disappear, and it is this:\nTake time for yourself, and for those you love, so that when the world outside your door requires that you roll your own sleeves up and step out into the uncertainty of it, you and your loved ones are that much better prepared to handle the inevitable suffering that will come your way. Find the things that make you happy, and enjoy doing them. Help others do the same, as much as you can. Try to learn from this each time, and understand that discovering things is truly one of the finest joys that this ridiculous life has to offer. The Flower to Disappear is the accumulation of many such things that I have discovered along the way, things I get excited about doing, seeing, listening to, talking about and sharing here with you. It is a defined branch in the path, where I may hold out my palm and offer you a momentary scenic route as a passenger. We'll get back on the main road again soon enough, don't you worry. I know where this road leads, as I've taken it many times over, and I think you'll like it. We can roll the windows down and hear the birds, feel the sunshine, or we can stay behind them, voyeurs taking in the uninterrupted splendor of the view. Your choice is your choice, and there are no wrong answers. As Harrison once said, \"I'm happy just to dance with you\"\nSo please accept my Flower to Disappear - a mere whiff of its magical blue petals, and we'll be off - bounding through a surrealistic landscape, happy to be carried for a while - and we can stay here as long as we'd like. The album, musically as well as thematically, has been designed to be functionally recursive - it ends only if and when we wish it to - and like all the little ripples in that cool pond, dappling outward from a single sinking flower, we'll remember all the times that came before, because remembering is also completely up to us. We can keep the happy, and subtract the sad - or maybe keep just a little of the sad, because it's where you've been, and not where you're going, that makes you who you are. A million branching paths behind us, a million conscious and subconscious decisions, all leading us both to this terminus of the here and the now, to the us of ourselves. This Flower to Disappear, it is only the next choice we can make, but just as each of those millions of decisions were necessary to bring us here, we must always decide where we will go next. So please, for my sake and for yours and for everyone else's, let us choose to be happy. Let us choose to continue, together.",

            "about": "\"I sail'd through the storm, I was refresh'd by the storm,\nI watch'd with joy the threatening maws of the waves,\nI mark'd the white combs where they career'd so high,\ncurling over,\nI heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,\nSaw from below what arose and mounted,\n(O superb! O wild as\nmy heart, and powerful!)\nHeard the continuous thunder as it bellow'd after the lightning,\nNoted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and\nfast amid the din they chased each other across the sky;\nThese, and such as these, I, elate, saw—saw with wonder, yet\npensive and masterful,\nAll the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,\nYet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from \"Rise O Days From Your Fathomless Deeps\"\n---\nOriginally broadcast overnight on May 23, 2023, 'The Glowing Book' is the seventeenth Sleepbuilding session to be released. Like all others before it, it is a free download, now and forever. It focuses on a study with the 3340 \"Curtis chip\"; so proliferated throughout many synthesizers (namely the Roland SH-101, a personal favorite), playing Flamenco scales with a Turing machine, two granular processors and multiple delay and reverberation paths.\nSelected from the growing archive of unpublished broadcasts by careful consideration with the Book of Changes, 'The Glowing Book' echoed the stormy hexagram cast by the I Ching in an electrical sense - producing a paradoxically sonorous sound from a small universe of patch cables, pulsing lights and directed current, invisible beneath the stoic exterior of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. This felt like an apt thing to consider as analogous to oscillation itself - a wave of current, bending up and then down again - or perhaps it is on and off, or opening and closing - and this wave can be mirrored by simply inverting voltage, a paradox in the pauses, and the inverse paradox resolving into a sound.\nWhat could be more illustrative of the core philosophy of the Book of Changes? Oscillation, before it is musical, before it is audible, before it is even electrical, is simply a season of change, a gradient from one polarity to another. Always leaving, and (as Eno may have been thinking when he said) always returning. Or was it Dylan? \"From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn plays wasted words, proves to warn that he not busy being born is busy dying\" - I'm fairly certain both men have been reading the same book I have, which is remarkably older than a lot of other books in the world today.\nSo, here is my contribution to that recursive discussion of perspective, my glowing mass of soundwaves and digital pixel text, beaming to (or through) you right this moment, a book with no pages, no words, no binding, no spine. A self-negating statement of silence to weave another paradox.\nN.B. Due to errors in the recording of the original broadcast audio, sections of 'The Glowing Book' have been edited and revised, however the casual listener will likely notice no differences, as the core of the music and its function remains the same.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "The Grove of Lustral Waters was a piece of music that happened almost entirely by accident, and like many such instances in my varied catalog, it becomes progressively more difficult to define or even explain how music this evocative can simply pour out of emotionless machines that I myself interact with at a minimum. After tuning several oscillators in two different Buchla modules (258t and 281t, for the heads who are curious), I set about testing their stability by sending them simple melodic sequences of between 2-5 notes (exploring the first 128 integers in Van Eck's sequence:  oeis.org/A181391  ) and recording the result for posterity.\nWhat then emerged from my modular system stopped my hands moving, and immediately transported me away from this cluttered desk and into some humid vista, surrounded by green trees, perhaps cypress, kissed by an orange sun, peering down into the clear water at the edge of a calm stream. Only later did I realize I was thinking subconsciously of 'The Summer's Day' from Böcklin, a symbolist painting from 1881, which seemed to perfectly illustrate the sounds and temperatures I was experiencing. I am lucky to be able to reproduce this beautiful painting for the cover of Lustral Waters, thanks to the forgiving nature of the public domain, and as I sit here now, typing this missive that says precious little that the music and painting cannot themselves reveal far more elegantly, I cannot imagine the painting and the music as separate things anymore.\nAnother, much longer version of The Grove of Lustral Waters exists, but I am saving that for another day (or night). Today, this recording is more than enough to accurately convey my joy at the Spring season returning, and my creative impulse's raw refutation of the misery and suffering coating the world like a poisonous oil. I hope, wherever and whenever you are able to find this message, it brings you a moment of pleasant displacement just the same. Perhaps then, on that perfect sunny day, frozen in time now just as it was in 1881, if it ever truly existed at all, we can find each other there, not recognizing who we are, but content in the present moment, grateful to be a part of it.",

            "about": "One year ago, almost to the day, I published The Grove of Lustral Waters as one of my first recordings exploring the Buchla oscillators in the models 258t and 281t. A variation on the patch, which changed the rate of the sequencing and a few other details, was recorded later that evening, and the first session was mastered and released alone. This second session is a little longer than the first, and despite being the same patch, compositionally and melodically, it manages to sound quite different, much in the same way a physical space can completely change given the right differences in weather, barometric pressure and time of day.\nListening to both sessions, back to back, a year after they were recorded, I feel a wondrous sense of disconnection from the work - remembering the sensations I felt when the session happened, but not really recalling specifics about the sound itself beyond that. Materially, the music feels very pensive, which I suppose is apt considering that then and now, I am fast approaching my birthday, and that brings with it all the usual appraisals of where we are in our lives, relative to where we feel we perhaps ought to be. This is an appropriate notion to apply to The Grove of Lustral Waters, which is offered as a pastorale, a painterly sound-atmosphere that drifts in and out of focus, feeling assertively composed in one moment, and meandering in the next - a perspective that is held between the near and the far, half acknowledging the present moment, and half wondering what the next moment might bring - and those two things, I've found, can complement each other beautifully.\nBoth sessions have been collected into a special limited edition 2xCD-R set, having never before seen a physical release until now. All purchases of this 2xCD-R set will come with a Bandcamp download code for the first Lustral Waters release, sent to the email account connected to the purchase.",

            "about": "\"To paint the finest features of the mind,\nAnd to most subtile and mysterious things\nGive colour, strength and motion. But the love\nOf nature and the muses bids explore,\nThro’ secret paths erewhile untrod by man,\nThe fair poetic region, to detect\nUntasted springs, to drink inspiring draughts;\nAnd shade my temples with unfading flow’rs.\nCull’d from the laureate vale’s profound recess,\nWhere never poet gain’d a wreath before.\"\n-Mark Akenside, excerpt from 'The Pleasures of Imagination' (1744)\n---\nIn my life, more so now than perhaps ever before, the need to accept the things that I cannot know or understand is an essential part of remaining sane. I've always espoused a positive view of the unknown, feeling content about the fact that no one can know everything, and further, no one can learn everything, remember everything or even understand it. The totality of the universe is designed to be forever elusive, and the human condition within it is designed to contain only a finite amount of data, much of which is mutable, with the usefulness of certain knowledge also changing as you age and accumulate more experiences. This is, perhaps, all simply stating the obvious - something that does not need to be said or written down - but all the same, I regularly find considerations like this to be much deeper than they may appear to be on the surface.\n\"The Half-Seen Door\" highlights these considerations, and returns to my conscious mind at a time when my personal biology has changed enough that I must change along with it, and this change has come at such a quick rate that I cannot possibly understand why it has happened, or what could have caused it. I need to accept the change in purely topical terms - continuing to investigate it, of course, to learn as much as possible - but to remove from the interim my need to know everything about it, especially in areas where that need manifests as physical stress and anxious worry. If that is all vague, it is supposed to be, and for what it's worth to mention here, I am not dying or so unhealthy that I should not be continuing with my work, but, to again state the obvious, nothing stays the same, and change is the only real constant. This is simply another change.\nMusically, \"The Half-Seen Door\" echoes its dual concept, with the Buchla 200 system playing multiple roles of subdued tuned-by-ear chordal forms (perhaps the portion of the proceedings that symbolize the conscious mind, if I were to make an analogy) alongside occasional lines of melodic lead work that surface above the cloudy chords, teasing out glimpses of the unknowable and unseeable beneath the cloud line. It feels simultaneously comforting and unpredictable, and highlights a state of mind where one must remove expectations and simply allow things to pass by, enjoying them where and when they are able to be understood, and forgetting them entirely when the air fills again with uncertainty, focusing instead on the contentment of that moment - a window to anywhere, with you and I fortunate enough to be aware of it at all.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "\"In the world of dreams I have chosen my part,\nTo sleep for a season and hear no word\"\n-Algernon Charles Swinburne, excerpt from 'A Ballad of Dreamland' (1879)\n---\n'The Hand of the Wind' is the eighteenth Sleepbuilding release to be published, originating as an overnight broadcast on February 19, 2023. It explores the unique voice of the Pulsar VCO in Expert Sleepers' Disting Mk4 multipurpose module, playing in the major pentatonic scale. Musically, it seems to recall moments from my 'Statuettes' albums, with a counterpoint between a lower register bassoon-like bass and a higher register flute-like lead profile.\nThis composition is one of several that feels profoundly close to my own \"manually\" written work, which brings to mind different philosophical considerations when it is in fact a fully generative piece conceived on my modular system, which has been provided with some basic instructions for possible output configurations, with room for variation based on probabilities, and I myself have spent more time on the shaping of the timbral character of the piece rather than the sequencing or the melodic nature of it.\nWhere I end, and the machine begins, is a nebulous and undefined area, because the modular is prosaically a mechanical mirror - it only does what I tell it to do, when I instruct it to. Garbage in, garbage out, as they say. Yet, when given a list of possible choices I'd make when offered a branch in the path forward, the machine invariably explores avenues that I myself may not have chosen to pursue. If this were untrue, I doubt modular music and generative composition would remain interesting in even a topical way, it would simply be an echo of something I was already more than capable of doing on my own, and in the age of machine assumption in many areas of our lives, I have no issues putting the effort in for a more human result in my work.\nAnd so, in this way, the machine is demystified - it is no longer an advanced collation of factors and moving systems, it is simply a conglomeration of screwdrivers, gardening tools and mindless electrical relays that only react, never truly act. I remain the central motivating force behind everything the machine does, even when I am not even in the same room with it, and this is an interesting consideration for me, because when this happens, I feel as you do - a voyeur looking in on an ecosystem in motion, marveling at it and enjoying it in a passive way - and yet still I remain somewhere buried beneath all the cables and voltage and flashing lights, decisive and direct, my mechanical mirror image echoing my will perfectly.\nGenerative music has been a continual path of progress toward many different ends for me, across the years I've explored it. First in software systems, then using tape machines, loop devices and samplers, and now within the vehicle of modular design - and each time I find a more efficient way of accomplishing a task that I set out to do, I find several other possible paths that intrigue me enough to feel as if I could become lost all over again. It is in this surrealistic state of superposition that I already exist and do not yet exist within my own work, and the Sleepbuilding sessions illustrate this sensation quite well.\n'The Hand of the Wind' is a free download, like all seventeen prior Sleepbuilding releases have been, and I sincerely hope this music aids you in a constructive and pleasurable way during this most invited of Autumns we're in at the moment. Be well, thank you for your support, and I hope to see you again next time.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "From the Second Sun press release, 2010:\n\"Heralding the return of rust-orange days and cool blue nights, Milieu's first new full-length at SSR since 2008 is an elegant and minimal affair. Comprised of three long tracks, all improvised and recorded live to tape with no overdubs, The Loneliness Of Empty Roads sees Brian at the guitar, unaccompanied, driving through the uninhabited backroads and highways of his subconscious. This is a blues album, reduced to single chords and clusters of notes. A live broadcast from an unmappable location to a humming car radio. Power lines and the occasional streetlight pass by, but nothing breaks the monochrome repetition of straight lines, static speeds and the hope of arriving at your destination soon. For those of you still finding your way home, here's one for the road.\"\nFrom the author, 2020:\nIt's difficult to believe that it's already been ten years since Empty Roads was released, and eleven since it was recorded live on my old Technics M11 cassette deck in the Rolling Knoll studio. It was the last Milieu recording issued at SSR before the label took a decade-long hiatus, which is what makes revisiting it here and now seem to surrealistic to me. Sitting at a desk in a basement studio in snow-covered Ohio, drinking coffee, South Carolina feels even further away than the six-hundred miles of measurement would indicate.\nTime is always the great eraser, and ten years into the lifespan of an album that was built from the perspective of moving on with my life, this feels truer than it's ever been, with so many topical and subsurface examples to point out. The photograph on the cover was taken in the backlot of the Horry County Memorial Library, the place that felt more like my home than the house I lived in when I was growing up in the 80s and 90s, because I was certainly there all the time. At the moment of that photograph, in March 2010, the library was already closed down and relocated to a newer structure elsewhere, the building used for storage or some other mundane thing after the integrity of the architecture had itself been compromised due to age.\nBy March of 2010, I was myself already several years removed from that library, and the entire Conway and Myrtle Beach area, having married my Russian queen and moved inland, to live in the shade of the Columbia water tower in 2005. I was revisiting all the old well-tread paths for memory's sake, to document it with Holga cameras, digital video, a Tascam DR-07 recorder and the faultiest documentarian of all, my own fried brain. It was a purpose-led trip, mostly done in the name of research for the pending release of Summer's Parting Ways (which has, ironically, waited until 2020 to be published at Attacknine), which as an album and project, was centrally composed to reference mostly places in that area. Another album about moving on with my life, through making peace with my past and crystallizing it into some kind of sifted, distilled substance to imbibe with whenever nostalgia struck me.\nI've always felt that artists in particular have a special talent that no one knows about, and it isn't the ability to write music or perform athletically on instruments or stages, but rather, it is the power to process the past, to mine it for riches, to editorialize it for the alleviation of trauma or the surgical-removal of regret, to compartmentalize what remains of that final walk backwards and shove it into a box in the basement, hastily labeled \"Old Stuff\" with or without a date for context, and to really truly move past it. We can use this ability consciously, turning the path of time's erasure against itself, and we can get away with it too. You're not talking about touching up the Mona Lisa, you're just keeping up with your mental health.\nSo, back to Empty Roads - the roads invoked in the title were and are a very specific stretch of highway between Main Street in Conway and my father's house in Loris, about a half hour's drive. Almost always empty, and especially so at night, which was often when I found myself driving on them, it was also the time and place I did much of my considering, before this whole Milieu-thing would even be a name on a sheet of notebook paper. Those roads were also the lonely ones, always filled with the slow filling up of regret after going to a party, or being stood up by a girl at some terrible punk rock show, the long comedown clarity you can only really find by spending time with yourself, by yourself, sitting still. Empty roads are a wonderful eraser too, just like time, and what is time anyway except one long empty road in one long empty direction? \"One foot on the gas and one in the grave\", a line from a record I played to death in my teens feels apt here.\nHowever, it would be remiss to become all maudlin and depressive and think of emptiness as only the opposite of fullness. Emptiness can be a beautiful thing, a simple open wonderment, room to grow, distance away from somewhere/one/thing, space fertile with the seeds of the future. It is this definition of emptiness and the visual symbolism of an empty road that I would like to consider relevant today, ten years into the dust caked on these sad guitar tapes. I myself feel disconnected and absent from the Brian Grainger I hear playing these guitar wails in a dingy bedroom studio late at night. He is long gone and far away, held safely inside the confines of this recording. It feels good to not have to be him anymore, to have reckoned with whatever loneliness he felt the need to convey here. Perhaps it's just what happens when you're as prolific as I am, and self-aware of the creative act being such a natural part of your ability to even live and breathe, that you don't quite realize the lifetimes that pass you by between seasons of inspiration and droughts of threadbare survival. Today, things are tough, but they are fruitful enough that I feel like I can say they're better, not better in a positive or negative sense, but better in that they are different. Better because I must have taken my own subconscious advice ten years ago, and in casting out these meditations on an empty road running through the deep Carolinian country in the middle of the night, I just kept moving forward, outward, away from those sad lands and further into the sunshine of my windy valley, contented and calm.\nNOTE: This reissue includes a second disc containing a DREAM COMPOST mix of the Empty Roads album. This is a previously unreleased session that transfigures the Empty Roads recordings themselves using a generative modular system and a sampler, and may appeal to fans of albums like PHOSPHENE WEATHER or THRIAMBUS as well.",

            "about": "\"The Severn Bore\" was originally broadcast live on the evening of September 25th, 2023, an ambient after-set following the release party for \"Watch the Head.\" It was thematically intended to expand on the atmosphere at the end of the penultimate track on \"Watch the Head\" - 'Nodens Monolith' - and offer a wider panoramic image of a seashore just barely within view from a Roman ruin in a forest grove, perhaps gazing further out to sea at a small island formation, wondering what might be there.\nIt also branches from 'Nodens Monolith' in that both compositions use the Dorian scale, albeit with \"The Severn Bore\" exploring that scale via the Buchla 200 system rather than a digital FM synthesizer as on 'Nodens,' and the relationship between both pieces is further solidified by the presence of ocean waves - a field recording on 'Nodens' and here, a synthesized approach using pink noise generators and multiple independently modulated/panned bandpass filters.\nAs usual, all of this technical information about the work offers hardly any insight into what it sounds like. \"The Severn Bore\" feels lonesome and isolated, filled with longing for something that may yet still arrive or happen, but by the end of its considerable runtime, does not. It exists alongside the Sleepbuilding series of long-form generative broadcasts, but sits apart from them in its deliberation and thematic design, a landscape painting that scores the backdrop for another album. Still, traces of Sleepbuilding remain in this piece - I have very carefully hidden Frantisek Kupka in the modulation of the cover art - and \"The Severn Bore\" can be utilized for waking and sleeping purposes, and most states between, just as the Sleepbuilding sessions can.\nOnce again, I'd like to offer my sincere thanks to everyone who listens to my work, and supports it in any capacity. \"The Severn Bore\" is a piece of music that would not exist if it were not for the attendees of the release party, and I always appreciate you being there.",

            "about": "The Sleeping Earth is a postscript to the first four albums at Arboreal Digest: Milieu, Of The Apple, Sun White Sun and A Warm Wooden Hollow. It compiles music made during and soon after those four albums' gestation, and stands solidly as an album itself, despite its separate origins.\nThe first ten tracks are taken from the Grassland Melodies split with Quosp, which originally appeared at Rope Swing Cities in 2006. These pieces inhabit a unique space that is equal parts Beyond The Sea, Of The Apple and early Coppice Halifax, with a very Teenager-like guitar piece thrown in.\nTracks 11/12 originally were commissioned for a compilation, though I cannot be certain if it ever came out. They were recorded about a month following Night Currents' release at U-Cover in Belgium, in 2006, and hinted at the direction Milieu recordings would largely go by the end of that year.\nTrack 13 was commissioned for an ongoing series of singles called 13 Weeks Of Summer, at Attacknine Records in 2007. It was the first single in the series, and bears some resemblance to my two guitar pieces on the four-way split Traveling at Sunrise Acoustics.\nTrack 14 is a previously unreleased outtake from the Milieu sessions in 2006. Likely left off the album because of its length (the Milieu album ended up being seconds short of 80 minutes long) and also perhaps for its resemblance to other tracks on that album. Here, however, it shines as a beautiful and sad gemstone, embedded in the key that unlocks this surreal tableau.",

            "about": "\"I go from bedside to bedside,\nI sleep close with the other sleepers each in turn,\nI dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,\nAnd I become the other dreamers.\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from \"The Sleepers\"\n'The Slumbering Pillar' is the fifteenth published release in the Sleepbuilding series, originally broadcast overnight on February 21st, 2023. It consists of two major pentatonic scales playing each of the oscillators in the Buchla 258t dual-oscillator, with sequencing informed by the usual probabilistic/subtractive/Boolean trigger array and multiple Turing machines handling modulation of the scales, all within my R-EW Audioholistics modular system.\nThis session was chosen for release after throwing the I Ching, and being given direction toward something that halts progress, albeit with the caveat that this only means a decision must be made, that continuing as before is no longer possible, clarifying that any choice made to proceed will be correct and fruitful. 'The Slumbering Pillar' stood out to me from the other sessions, as I considered this - it is the lone session from the backlog of broadcasts that specifically refers to stillness in its title, and the fabric of the sound itself reiterates this, with slow arcs of chordal tones, intermittently lit in the darkness by flickers of illuminated texture. It sounds like a recording of a resting place at the bottom of a sea, except that the waters are warm and convey a sense of the most divine and comfortable sleep I can imagine.\nOverall, the Sleepbuilding releases have been designed for a number of different purposes, lending themselves well to several waking, working and resting states, but 'The Slumbering Pillar' somehow feels more inert to me, a truly drowsy and soporific ambient work. Perhaps this is the deeper level awareness of the major pentatonic scales - easily the most recognizable and widely played scale in Western music - and hearing them played in the absolute opposite of melodic composition is what makes the air around the sound seem to slow down.\n'The Slumbering Pillar' knows not, cares not. It rests, in the most absolute of all possible rests - musical, physical, philosophical - and the world moves on above and beyond it. Here, time is a worthless bounty of riches, gold and jewels left to rot in the rib cages of sunken ships, allowed to dissolve wastefully as we join in a long contented sigh with the sound waves. The end of all progress, planted like a plinth in the seabed, where making no decision at all, ever again, is the only path left to take.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

It was originally recorded on December 13, 2023, and is an exploration of the Dorian scale using the Korg Poly 800 polyphonic synthesizer from 1983.\n\"Container\" has been chosen for release during the month of May, being the month of my birth, 41 years ago, as well as the month of Milieu's birth 20 years ago. It conjures into mind many different considerations, and for the first time in the ongoing Sleepbuilding catalog, I feel that it is preferable to leave those things unwritten and unsaid. Here, the music is amply able to speak for itself, and whatever images, themes or temperatures you find within it are complete and correct.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "A quiet log cabin, perched atop a summit in the Black Mountains of Asheville, overlooking hundreds of miles of sun-kissed forest and stone. Summoning the voice of a synthesized drone, calling from the Matterhorn itself, your stillness, isolation and warm contentment rings out across the space. The wooden, hollow tones overlap with the subtlest hint of tape warble and heat-bent flange, forming chords that elevate you in their polyphony to a serene mass high in the clouds. For every pipe in this majestic dream-organ, a ray of sunlight beams down to the ripe green Earth. Birds chime from their perches with sweet approval, and the gusts of mountain breeze underscore the floating symphony with the deep breath of the valleys and rivers themselves.\nThis album has been created with the specific purpose of recovery from trauma, meditation in light of stress, a defiant escapist pasture of safety and contentment in the face of paranoia, worry and pain. The Synthesist's Alphorn Retreat exists forever, for all of us, whenever and wherever we may need to use it.",

            "about": "\"Every way ends, every road,\nevery foot-path leads at last\nto the hill-crest—\nthen you retrace your steps,\nor find the same slope on the other side,\nprecipitate.\"\n-H.D., excerpt from \"The Sheltered Garden\" (1916)\n---\nWhen I recorded 'Time Bell' in June of 2023, I was still deeply involved in exploring Nintendo's magnificent 'Tears of the Kingdom' installation in the Legend of Zelda series. Zelda games have always held a special fascination for me, and the release before you is the closest I'll probably get to combining things like my Hylian Improvisations recordings with the Sleepbuilding series.\nThe music played here is in the minor pentatonic scale, exploring the voice of the modal resonator in Mutable Instruments' Rings. It recalls a forlorn atmosphere of fragmented islands, floating impossibly in the sky, with ancient machines waiting there in a dormant state for the time bell to ring, a day that never comes for thousands of years.\nThe glassy tones are sparse, wind-blown, carried from one cloud-covered islet to another, weaving through ruined stone buildings and verdant overgrowth, never quite resolving or settling, but merely present in a disconnected way. With all of the severe weather this valley has seen as of late, I personally find a lot of comfort in the tempo and spacious nature of these sounds.\nApril is itself a special month for me - since 2012, it has been the month I became a father - and so 'Time Bell' is also offered here on the occasion of my daughter's birthday, as Zelda remains one of many things we share interests in together. Through this lens, 'Time Bell' takes on an entirely new symbolism, one that aligns positively with Springtime, rejuvenation and rebirth, and a measured appraisal of the past at a recurrent point in time's linearity.\nFurther still, I rest assured that you will find a different meaning somewhere in these somnolent tones, and your reading of this material is also true. 'Time Bell' is a marker in a landscape that changes with or without us in it, and much like the inert automatons in the picturesque ruins of the Hyrulian sky, we may wake up and mark the time with something important to us, or we may remain asleep, and let time keep its own lonesome company.\nThe time bell is ambivalent, and it only ever means anything if and when we decide that it means something. Today, for me, it means that twelve years have passed, and so much is different while so much more has remained the same, and once again my work finds me held between two ends of a spectrum, always coming from somewhere and making my way elsewhere.\nN.B. - There were some peaking errors in the original broadcast, which have been isolated and mitigated to the best of my ability, but there are still little remnants of those errors here. Nothing that should wake you up from a meditative state, I hope, but there is only so much you can do with broadcast audio like this after the fact, and your patience and understanding are appreciated.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com\n24/7 Endless Ambient Broadcast Station at Twitch:  twitch.tv/analogbotany",

            "about": "THE TRAVELER'S OFFWORLD RETREAT is a longform synthesizer pastorale designed and generated using only the ByteBeat digital audio workstation in the video game No Man's Sky, published by Hello Games on the PlayStation 4. Using these systems in a generative way, it is possible to leave this arrangement unspooling twenty-four hours a day in yet another virtual space - a \"paradise\" planet in the Euclid galaxy that I've spent hundreds of hours cataloguing, cultivating and making into a serene home-away-from-homeworld. It was created with the express purpose of being an Enosian windchime to enjoy while I relaxed on my sofa for some space-farming.\nNo Man's Sky is, somewhat famously, a procedurally generated video game, containing more planets than any one person (or collective people) would ever hope to explore in their lifetimes. It is a love letter to visual artists like Chris Foss and, for an immense list of reasons, one of my favorite video games of all-time. Sonically, this recording was inspired by things like Synergy's Computer Experiments Volume One and Jochem Paap's two beautiful FM synthesizer albums on FAX, and perfectly aligned with the ethos and synthesis-curious approach of many modern Milieu recordings.\nFor any other listeners who are themselves Travellers of the Atlas (or even a SalesGek, no judgments), I've included an image with this release's download that contains my planet's address. Hop in your ship, find your nearest monolith and come say hello. I have a prosperous living glass farm that served me well before I joined the game of freighter trade routing, and would welcome the company. Plenty of GekNip in the stash, no storms at all, and hardly a Sentinel in sight.",

            "about": "Originally broadcast on the evening of March 16th, 2024, \"The Tripartite Division\" was a unique exploration of Behringer's Model D** - a modern recreation of Moog's Minimoog Model D from 1970 - a monophonic analog synthesizer with three oscillators and fairly standard modulation, amplifier, envelope and filter sections. Today, it may be considered rather 'vanilla' in the wider landscape of synthesis, but while I cannot make comparative notes between the original Moog (beyond what I could learn from my guru at Noyzelab) and Behringer's reiteration, the machine I had in front of me for this session retained enough textural and timbral interest to justify doing an overnight stream with it. Special thanks are owed to Greg Lawhun, who some may recognize from his illustration and painting work on Milieu and Coppice Halifax albums, as the Model D belongs to him and was generously loaned to the White Pillar studio for exploratory recordings such as this one.\nTo extract the very most out of the three oscillators in the Model D, a number of peripheral tools and processors were used from within the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, including sequencing in the Dorian scale in Ornament & Crime, with timing for the sequencer determined via the Dnipro Dot three-channel Euclidean trigger sequencer and the five-step Buchla 245t Sequential Voltage Source. The post-processing of the Model D signal only included two delay paths - a three-part asynchronous delay in Reticulum Versio from Noise Engineering and a four-head tape delay in Strymon's Magneto. All modulation originated from within the Model D, and the only external filter used was Behringer's 1006 Filtamp, from their ARP 2500 series.\nMusically, it's a bit different from many of the other Sleepbuilding installments, and why shouldn't it be, at the golden number of 32? It feels distantly inspired by some of the old Rephlex dusty bedroom sort of mid-fi ambient that I have always been so fond of, not quite as isolated and alien as SAW II, but more home-cozy and warm. Perhaps that is the subtractive analog dynastic architecture seeping in, settling in around me like a nice blanket. It's impossible to tell anymore, where most of these surreal shapes come from, and I like that just fine.\n**(It bears mentioning here that in the time since this broadcast, I have stopped buying any new Behringer machines, and have 'soft retired' the units I already own, slowly removing them from my regular usage as they are replaced by more robust things. I don't have an issue with Behringer remaking old machines that cost an arm and a leg, and are almost entirely unavailable to the general synthesizing public, but their continual cribbing of current designs by modern companies like Make Noise, Arturia, Intellijel and even Moog and Korg have really soured me on their brand. Their antagonistic behavior online toward the synth community, their general build quality and their inability to reinforce the patch points on their machines has also completely pushed me away. It is regrettable, but the companies that Behringer are stealing from deserve better. Still, I have no issue whatsoever with anyone else using or buying Behringer machines - owning instruments is, sadly, still a point of privilege and this has not been lost on me throughout the years as I've accrued quite a studio of devices, and for this reason I am still glad their cheap plastic remakes exist, if only to entice newcomers who are curious about synthesis and perhaps cannot afford machines from other manufacturers. The Dude abides, the more the merrier, gatekeeping is never welcome in any creative ecosystem.)",

            "about": "\"I exist as I am, that is enough,\nIf no other in the world be aware I sit content,\nAnd if each and all be aware I sit content.\nOne world is aware and by far the largest to me,\nand that is myself,\nAnd whether I come to my own to-day\nor in ten thousand or ten million years,\nI can cheerfully take it now,\nor with equal cheerfulness I can wait.\nMy foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite,\nI laugh at what you call dissolution,\nAnd I know the amplitude of time.\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from 'Song of Myself' (1892)\n---\n'The Water's Path' is the twentieth Sleepbuilding session to be released on Bandcamp, and it exists as a referential look back to where the series began in November 2022, with 'Creation' - a Karplus-Strong synthesizer in my modular system, playing the Dorian scale, left to meander through the night as I slept. 'The Water's Path' clocks in at fifteen hours in length, and offers a soporific disconnection from the outside world.\nI find that this piece offers a wonderful perspective when placed as a counterpoint to the start of the series - to indeed observe the length and breadth and depth of the water's path - and considering the commonalities between the design of both compositions, they are both extremely similar to one another and entirely different. This state of superposition is one that I find myself referring back to often, with modular music, because within this set of peripheries and possible tangents, I myself remain the one constant, the one element that does not and cannot really change. I can follow the river where it goes, and I can direct it sometimes in order to excavate the visions I dream up from inside the stone, but ultimately, it goes where it will, and anything I could fashion out of the natural world would return to it anyway.\nWhitman's words again bring me some gentle reassurance here, in the dissonance of these moments. It is good to accept that I am content where and when I am, and to be doing the work that I find worthwhile and inspiring regardless of whether or not you are here beside me. I've written a lot here about time, about my place in all of this machinery, and in the end there's always a pervading sense that I might as well say nothing at all, because the music itself always speaks far more clearly and completely than my struggling tongue can.\nI can laugh at the dissolution of the statues I've built, I can be assured that I am a part of everything just as the grains of the Urth are. The water and the air, the same but different, move across the surfaces, carrying me away and bringing us back together again, where we will have the same conversation once more, wondering why it feels so familiar.\n---\nYouTube playlist of all Sleepbuilding broadcasts:  www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcjgVJRSgeSHy00DZLB8zFFIJbIgcYjo\nAll prior Sleepbuilding releases to date (all FREE):  campsite.bio/oscillog\nFor more generative ambient music delivered to your inbox automatically each month, please consider subscribing to my Vibratelepathos series:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

Comprised of five tracks named for clouds, Three Tone Quintet is spacious house-influenced dance music, inspired by Juan Atkins' Infiniti material, Underworld and AFX.",

            "about": "Thriambus, originally conceptualized and recorded as the follow-up to Phosphene Weather at Install, is now drafted from the Install wine cellar, dusted off and allowed to be shared with the world. Phosphene Weather, if you don't know, was my first vinyl release, and as such was a great stress to create and finish. It follows that the return to a template with a standard set so highly was in effect even harder to do. So Thriambus dripped out of me slowly, over a year or so, until I felt it was a perfect statement by itself, and in consideration next to Phosphene. Like that album, it functions almost entirely on composition by way of processing and rephrasing of orchestral loops, harvested from vinyl, laid to tape, and used as the paint for my studio paintbrush. The one exception is \"Winter's Gasping Revenge\" - a lone guitar and pedal bass piece amid the impressionist fog, much like Phosphene's guitar odyssey \"Aboir\" was the counterpoint to the faded looping sadness of its first side. Thriambus is what I consider to be one of my most accomplished ambient works from the last few years, and a pillar in the swamp of my many shallower excursions. Inside it sleeps a part of my creative self that has now been permanently etched into the soundwaves.",

However, due to numerous unforeseen things, such as label-related delays, personal changes in taste, and so on, the Petrol album ended up in the Milieu Music vaults for a few years. I always liked it, but after recording and releasing its follow-up H Is For Hologram, I almost felt it was better to leave Petrol unreleased. After lots of prodding from my friends who seem to love these songs, as well as those rose-tinted glasses of nostalgia going over my eyes after a few years passed, I think it is finally time to let Petrol have its day in the sunshine. So here it is, a playful album of psychedelic Milieu melodies with bright blissed chords, funky basslines and the usual drum programming that isn't quite sure if it's ready for the dancefloor or the bedroom.\nAdditionally, in the spirit of releasing this full-length, I've also decided to reissue the original MML061 EP, which I'm told has some pretty cracking tunes on it.\nPSC, wherever you may be, this is for you.",
            "credits": "released November 25, 2012\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at 114RKD, 2009. This is Milieu Music number MMD023. Yes Eric that is totally what you think it is. Cover photo taken by William Grainger. Flying M contains a sample from If.... (1968).",

            "about": "Tidewater Petrol celebrates ten years, although this is a bit of a misnomer, as the recordings themselves were already in excess of two years old by the time it was published on a limited CD-R edition in 2012.\nMusically, this places Tidewater as the liminal bridge between Swaying Palms and H is for Hologram, and the album could be appropriately described as being fully informed by aspects of both of those albums, with spacious and humid reverberated melodies and pad chords washing like colorful waves over more dancefloor-friendly rhythmic arrangements, peppered with science-fiction references and more topical associations with defunct petroleum companies (which have seemed to be completely overlooked and/or misunderstood by everyone listening for the last decade, understandably).\nThe Tidewater sessions were also notable at the time for being my first truly devoted experiments with polymetric composition, with a track like 'Eagle Nebula' feeling like a surrealistic outlier at the time, only now lining up more evenly against things like 'Sets U Free' from Sun Cast, or the majority of material on The Flower to Disappear. Tidewater illustrates a moment of Milieu in flux - many of the voices used to convey basslines, lead flourishes and even the drums were digital things like FM synthesizers and Karplus Strong engines, abandoning the sample-heavy nature of earlier efforts, replacing drum breaks with a Korg ER-1 and Boss DR-660, and filling the studio sandbox with deprecated VSTs from Cakewalk and Jeskola Buzz - already outmoded software in 2009.\nA well-hidden Mick Travis quote, spoken by Malcolm McDowell in 1968, provides a small echo of the psychedelic shorelines of Swaying Palms - 'There's only one thing you can do with a girl like this - walk naked into the sea together as the sun sets, make love once, then die' - a deliberate and tongue-in-cheek implication from the Brian of twelve years ago that Tidewater was very much meant to be a vessel of progress and transition at the time of its creation. Also audibly present are aspects of parallel developments, such as the Euflorian strains of sound design and melodicism in 'Sleepy Explorers' or the drifting tape ambience weaving through the backdrop of 'Petrol in Pink', which recalls Ocean Lion II. A lot of music was being drafted in 2008-2009, and pieces of all of these sessions are observable in the three EP Reverb Microcoma set, which attempted to organize most of the material overflow.\nOn a technical level, a number of these tracks were mixed rather badly, as the momentum of the project's exploration of new territory seems to have outpaced my ability to properly organize the wealth of often obtuse and unorthodox sound design. As a result, twelve years after the fact, I've had to dig deeper than usual into my archives for session files, discontinued sound fonts, effects processors that have long since been removed from modern device support, and so a significant portion of the remastering had to be completed in defunct builds of software, sometimes even rebuilding aspects of the tracks themselves where something did not load with its original settings - the utterly ridiculous fallout of using software tools that no longer exist - so I ask for a bit of patience and understanding, perhaps even forgiveness, for any unavoidable differences from the original mixes of Tidewater. Every effort has been made to retain the shape and sound of the original album, although due to my longtime use of randomizers in arpeggiation, modulation envelopes and filter behaviors, the differences between this remaster and the original takes are a fundamental part of the process. For this reason, I will continue to make the original mix of Tidewater available digitally - this remaster does not seek to overwrite or invalidate what came before, but instead, offer a different perspective on the fidelity of the recordings, with some minor (and in my view, inconsequential) changes.",

While the TP full-length still remains unreleased, this EP is a strong followup to Swaying Palms, retaining much of the hyper-melodic dancefloor style of SP while introducing a much glossier production sound, and flexing the range of the music via constant tempo shifts, overloaded FX processing and complex rhythm programming.",

            "about": "\"It is enough, that harmony appears\"\n-S. Davies, 1758\n---\nThe 33rd Sleepbuilding broadcast to be mastered and published is \"To Face Always Toward the Sun,\" an optimistically named session exploring three different wavetable synthesizers through three different scales and root keys.\nOriginally recorded and broadcast live with OBS on the evening of June 20th 2024, \"To Face Always\" was the first proof-of-concept experiment with the Squares and Circles firmware in Ornament & Crime - a third version of the machine in my modular system, this time more robust with the incorporation of the Teensy 4.0 board - which consists of up to four channels of either machine voice, audio processor or modulation source. In this session, the machine used the first three channels for wavetable voices (the same ones present in Mutable Instruments' Braids) and the fourth channel for an instance of Mutable Instruments' Clouds as an auxiliary send for the three voices.\nAll modulation (with minor exceptions) originated from within Squares and Circles, as it offers an extensive array of virtual patching that effectively makes the machine itself quite capable of doing the lion's share of the work with regard to tone shaping and timbral variation. Supplemental modulation for the external signal processors used (two more instances of Mutable Instruments' Clouds, Noise Engineering's Multi Versio in Lo-Fi mode and Strymon's Magneto and Starlab units) came from the Buchla Source of Uncertainty and 258 dual-oscillator.\nThe first part of this session was sequenced in G minor pentatonic, the second part in F sharp / Aeolian and the third part in E / Dorian, using the now-standard Quantermain sequencer in another Ornament & Crime module. Filters used include two from Behringer's ARP 2500 line (the 1004 Filtamp and the 1047 Resonator) and one from 2HP's low-pass filter module.\nMusically, the piece always brought to mind the sun - not in a sunlight and terrestrial sense, but rather, as a star floating in the cosmic expanse. There are constant per-note modulations from the octave of a given note in a scale, to the filtering of that note, the resonance of it, as well as the relative shape of the waveform itself inside the wavetable. This complex system allows for the music to be both consistent with itself in a melodic sense overall, but also incredibly spacious and varied, with a large emphasis on open spaces of distance between events, some clustered together and some far apart, and many different sizes and spaces of reverberation. It feels the way I might expect all the planetary bodies, systems and objects in the night sky to sound if the vacuum of space were not present, and allowed those things to generate acoustic sound.\nI'm very pointedly issuing \"To Face Always\" on Inauguration Day, when things feel quite abysmal for many of the people in my country (and the wider world) who did not want things to be the way that they are apparently determined to be. It feels as if we continue to regress, to decline and decay, and in moments like these I think it is important to both voice my displeasure and express my sadness, while also using my work as a processing tool to mark this moment, and to move forward, away from the darkness, as much as it is possible to do so. I don't know what we will have to live through in the next four years, but I know that wherever we are, we must be there together, and no matter how dark these long nights seem to feel, we must always look forward, to the horizon, waiting for the sun to come up again.\n---\nAll 32 prior Sleepbuilding releases (all FREE) plus many other FREE albums:  campsite.bio/oscillog",

            "about": "\"Transient Logics\" was a Coppice Halifax album released earlier in the Summer of '24. \"Transient Logics\" is also a Milieu album, issued appropriately during the transition between Summer and Autumn. Both albums are the same compositional work, however the Milieu and Coppice Halifax iterations of that work differ in their perspectives - the view of the same landscape becoming radically altered while remaining fundamentally the same.\n\"Transient Logics\" was a privately commissioned work for David Hamlin, which gestated and metamorphosed multiple times throughout a two-year span, beginning life as the session recently issued as \"A Pentacle in Red Sapphire,\" before shifting into the not-yet-released \"Forest Idyl\" album, and finally, into the ten tracks you see before you (along with the Halifaxian version issued here:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/transient-logics  ). Hamlin graciously wanted these recordings to be released publicly, and so they appear here with his blessing, and bearing his photography and visual art for their cover images.\nA clear line can be drawn thematically between \"A Pentacle\" and the Milieu pieces assembled here - the former being inspired by the cyclical elements of the Tao, and the latter embodying those same elements in a different sense, the emphasis on the four seasons and their transitions into and out of one another. Marking the passage of time through the changes in weather, color, temperature and pressure has long been a part of Milieu and Coppice Halifax recordings, and this practice feels especially pertinent here, bearing music that is meant to explore the gradients between two things, just as I myself am forever between both Milieu and Coppice Halifax, among several others, as creative expressions. I am all of those things, and yet none of them, and both of these statements remain true.",

            "about": "A new 3\" CD-R EP containing one long track from the recording sessions for to-be-released Milieu album. Recorded in spring, left to settle on a cassette, then fixed up in summertime. Musically similar to something like Of The Apple or the upcoming Phosphene Weather LP, this piece has lots of deep humming bass, raindrop-organ lines and sweeping dusky chords. Perfect for a cool night with the windows open and a cat napping on your lap.",

            "about": "Transposition Gradients is a recollection of melodic composition, initially written and recorded in 2013-2014, revisited five years later in a foggy, half-remembered vision, meditated upon as a balm for an overstressed mind. The original components were arranged and released at Recycled Plastics as two volumes of an album called Polypsilon. At the time, Polypsilon was to be Milieu's formal entry into the bedroom acid sound, though I distinctly recall there being some very pretty melodies and chord changes, so I'd always known that sooner or later, I'd dig out the session recordings and put my hands back into the clay.\nThe material presented here could be considered an analog to other records like it - Inland By Night, Ambell Suns, albums that reconstituted melodic passages from other albums and painted new ambient vistas from them. However, it also bears some resemblance to releases like Improvisations For Hylian Piano & Woodwinds and Statuettes, in the way the voices of synthesizers are brought a bit more to the forefront than on other beatless Milieu recordings. It's interesting to me, to consider these parallel-reality kinds of takes, a \"What if?\" version of a piece of music - in this case, what if Polypsilon was intended to be an ambient record?\nTransposition Gradients is such a ponderance, a possible past, a reflection seen through ripples of water, on the bank of a pond, distantly grasped through years of eroding memory, finally allowed to exhale in a deep sigh of relief as I reach the grassy backyard in Deerfield, with the apple tree and the sunny leaves and the musty garage. I can almost smell it, and that small boy is still there now, wistfully sitting on the water's edge, tossing the occasional stone and watching the sun slowly drip down beneath the horizon line, extinguished like a torch in the dark idyll.",

            "about": "For Earth Day 2022, I wanted to put something special together that both reflected my nightly hash rituals (which were just celebrated in fuller form on the 20th) and focused more upon the natural world itself, with quiet (but not silent) outdoor spaces and organic sound-material that might not necessarily be musical or metered in any way, but remained pleasing to the ears all the same.\nMany listeners already know how devoted I am to video games and their immersive (and sometimes, cathartic) experiences, as well as my lifelong love of science-fiction, and so it should come as no surprise that I have been unable to stay away from Horizon: Forbidden West as of late - an even more incredible sequel to one of my favorite games ever made. Like my fascination with Zelda (see: Hylian Improvisations) and space travel (see: The Traveler's Offworld Retreat), Horizon ticks off many different boxes in the list of my personal interests - ecology, historical fiction, post-apocalyptic landscapes, artificial intelligence and complex programming, philosophy, theology and astronomy - as well as being a superbly well-written story with memorable characters, a unique world landscape and many relevant points of modern progressivism.\nInstead of simply gushing about this game for hours on end, I've preferred to illustrate my appreciation by doing what I always do: fashioning a sonic landscape that could exist somewhere in that fantasy world. As harsh and bleak as many of the locations in Horizon often are, there are also many moments of overwhelming beauty enmeshed within it, almost like a more traditionalist western tale, with dusty frontiers, treasure-filled ruins, tribal warriors, unrequited lovers and lone wanderers. For as alien as the landscape in Horizon has become, it never fails to remind me that it was once our where and when, a modern age of bustling civilization and omnipresent technology, now relegated to an eroded memory, a thousand years gone, as the Earth has reclaimed itself.\nWithin that world, there are a people that call themselves Utaru. They live in step with nature, building their villages in the remnants of great satellite dishes, covered in vines and greenery, high above the ground. They tend to the land and try to avoid conflicts, and their culture is centered around singing and music, which they believe connects them to their gods. I have no hesitation in saying that, were I to find myself in the where and when of Horizon's Earth, I would want to live with the Utaru. Perhaps I'd be a traveling bard, migrating from settlement to settlement, bringing news from other places, making my trade by selling salvage, crops or bright gemstones called Greenshine.\nI'd lead a small caravan of friends and family who shared my outlook, and we'd enjoy a colorful and nomadic existence on the periphery of so much conflict and uncertainty. In times of the former, or the latter, we'd play and sing, just as I do today, and I would share this experience with as many as I could, hoping to bring even a brief respite from the harsh truths of the outside world. At the end of every sun-baked day, we'd retire around the dwindling purple campfire beneath a blanket of stars, with no electric lights to blot out all the millions of perfect pinholes, sharing a pipe of green grass and a quiet moment of communion with the Earth mother herself, warm and contented with the things we have, soon to be asleep in the certainty that life is forever changing, and better for it.\nHappy Earth Day, today and every day.",

Anxiety-reducing, fantasy-enacting, holistic vibrations that may not cure sickness or stop time, but they can and will absolutely bring comfort and calmness to people whose lives are otherwise in chaos.\nThese broadcasts have been carefully recorded using generative systems of hardware/software, including a modest modular synthesizer configuration, multitrack tape, analog and digital effects devices and a flexible DAW for the finishing touches. The resultant audio is beautiful but also benign, depending on what you need it to be and when. It functions at normal volumes or very low levels, it will work for sleeping or meditation, it can be cast in the background as you read or bathe. It maintains a stillness, but also provides gentle stereo movements if you're wearing headphones. It is the closest thing I may have ever done to an all-purpose new age sound environment. There is no set limit to the amount of broadcasts in this series - it will remain ongoing until it is either no longer necessary or I am no longer able to maintain it.\nFor now, be kind, stay safe and try your best to remain healthy and happy until we can all be together again.\nNOTE: Until otherwise indicated, this series will remain digital format only. Shipping physical goods is not advisable or safe given the level of the viral outbreak in my residential area. Hopefully, this will change, but unless/until it does, I'm staying away from the post office as much as possible.",

When islanders inhabiting the soundworlds of Tigress lie down at night to sleep, Flawless Amethyst is all the stars in the sky above them. It has been mixed intentionally quiet and is designed as an unintrusive sleep and meditation aid, and can play for more than a full 24-hour day without repeating at all. Listeners are discouraged against using these recordings while operating machinery or driving.",

            "about": "While the world outside your door darkens as Mother Nature's modern mutant silently menaces almost every aspect of your life, I've done my best to fortify myself and my family within the White Pillar Workshop, and I've set to work immediately upon an ongoing set of \"broadcasts\" that will deliver the one thing I can distribute from my studio to the entire world: Music. Anxiety-reducing, fantasy-enacting, holistic vibrations that may not cure sickness or stop time, but they can and will absolutely bring comfort and calmness to people whose lives are otherwise in chaos.\nThese broadcasts have been carefully recorded using generative systems of hardware/software, including a modest modular synthesizer configuration, multitrack tape, analog and digital effects devices and a flexible DAW for the finishing touches. The resultant audio is beautiful but also benign, depending on what you need it to be and when. It functions at normal volumes or very low levels, it will work for sleeping or meditation, it can be cast in the background as you read or bathe. It maintains a stillness, but also provides gentle stereo movements if you're wearing headphones. It is the closest thing I may have ever done to an all-purpose new age sound environment. There is no set limit to the amount of broadcasts in this series - it will remain ongoing until it is either no longer necessary or I am no longer able to maintain it.\nFor now, be kind, stay safe and try your best to remain healthy and happy until we can all be together again.\nNOTE: Until otherwise indicated, this series will remain digital format only. Shipping physical goods is not advisable or safe given the level of the viral outbreak in my residential area. Hopefully, this will change, but unless/until it does, I'm staying away from the post office as much as possible.\nNOTE II: Greenest Grass Whitest Clouds is the beautiful combination of my oft-cited Grass Click-Tone Control Module (a piece of medical laboratory equipment that I have repurposed as a tone generator) and the immensely versatile Clouds texture synthesizer by Mutable Instruments. As with many of the sessions for these Broadcasts, the sound of the Grass was conveyed through the medium of multitrack cassette tape, layered into four harmonic pitches at four different IPS. A bit of actual loss in translation occurred, as the original tape was recorded using my Tascam 414 machine (with Dolby noise reduction) and this session saw the same tape played back on my Vesta Fire MR-10B machine (which uses very different dbx noise reduction). Both machines also run at totally different speeds, so interesting artifacting was present as well. The signal was routed in and out of my Clouds module alongside my modest Eurorack rig, containing four modules from the green series by SSDP Synthesis, incorporating additional CV animation via the Korg MS-20 and three Moogerfoogers. From there, it was routed into my Peavey mixer, which is currently configured to function as an \"Autofugue\" generative setup involving signal multiplication, timed delays and pitch shifting, among other things. Final audio repair and mastering work were completed on the evening of April 19th, using a DAW primarily running Arturia filtering and reverberation tools.\nNOTE III: I have been unable to reach my dispensary as of late, given the outside circumstances, so light something up for me. Happy Fourtwenty of Fourtwenty.",

            "about": "On March 17th of 2020, just as this terrible pandemic was thrust upon us, I began an open-ended series of ambient music that was designed, from the ground up, to be a balm for tired minds, a respite from the turbulence of the world and an easily accessible escape from everything in it. I devised the term \"Vibratelepathic Antiviral Broadcast\" to project the ethos of what I was doing clearly, although this became colloquially shortened to Vibratelepathos almost immediately, which probably says a lot about my state of mind in 2020.\nMusically, these pieces would be led and informed by my growing interest in generative systems, which mutated and developed on a constant basis through the arrangement and expansion of my R-EW Audioholistics modular system. The R-EW was designed early on with processing and modulation in mind, rather than outright sound generation, meaning that the aim was to create a machine that could effectively take any incoming sound source and transfigure it into many different other sounds. Such a system would give far greater range and depth to the many synthesizers, drum machines and FX units I'd collected through the years, and in turn provide them with new purposes and possibilities as well.\nIt didn't take long for the R-EW system to start making magic, and because of the success of the sessions presented here, I actually progressed much more quickly than I anticipated through the growth of the system, picking up more new hardware for this monolith in 2020 than any other year I've ever used gear at all. This fact, again, likely points to the kind of year we've all had, and I am lucky that my work allowed me enough money to facilitate this idea to such a degree. As of my writing this now, the R-EW consists of twenty-nine separate modules, each with their own personality and utility.\nThis collection illustrates just how far I've progressed within only a year of this series, with this generative approach, and even now, there are still a dozen or so hours of session material from 2020 that has yet to be mastered and issued in the catalog. The versions of the recordings presented here are the CD-R edits as well - notably, AVB4 (Flawless Amethyst) appears in a \"microdose\" 3xCD edit, instead of the 28-hour digital version - although even with their more \"modest\" runtimes, these 32 recordings total over 28 and one-half hours of material to explore. Also omitted from this set are the numerous issuances in the PATHOS subcatalog, which remain exclusive to paid subscribers of the Vibra series (and as of this text total over thirteen hours of music themselves).\nAs Vibratelepathos moves forward into 2021, I am even more excited to share what's new and what has already come to pass, than I was when I began the catalog last year. I hope that you'll find some level of solace and peacefulness in these recordings, and perhaps even find more ways to use these sounds to adequately fit your needs than the applications I've kept in mind while designing them. I'm also happy to say that soon, I will be doing live audio-video broadcasts of Vibra sessions via Bandcamp itself - these events will hopefully become regular, perhaps even weekly, and will come with surprises such as a bonus download with your ticket purchase, or exclusive merch sold only for the duration of the live set. I hope to see you there!",

            "about": "Continuing the ever-expanding and tangential thread of my Vibratelepathos series has become not only something creatively fulfilling, but holistically reliable as well. These twenty broadcasts, manifested through twenty-seven different pieces from April 2021 to March 2022, total over twenty-seven hours of recordings (and these are only the CD edits - many of the master recordings are several hours in length individually - those fully unabridged versions are available at the Vibra page:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ). Evidence of so many generative processes, traversals guided by the lamplight of controlled voltage, leaving a trail of unspooled tape through the winding landscapes I've visited.\nAt the outset of this series, the pandemic had just begun, and I was filled with a strong desire to really dedicate a sizeable portion of my time, my creative work and my catalog to helping people deal with that. In the time since then, things feel unfortunately as if they have only become worse - war and violence, systemic oppression and the erosion of human rights, economic instabilities, and unchecked climate change that continues to prove to us just how harsh a parent Mother Earth can be. The pandemic still isn't over, and I feel, some days, that we're further down in this abyss than we've ever been before.\nAnd so, Vibratelepathos continues onward, upward, outward, for all worlds and times, pure and ego-less sound, vibration as utility, sonic pacifism, a universal drug for a weary world and its frequently hopeless people. These recordings have all helped me in great and small ways, to process all of the grief, to address the suffering and to attempt to deal with it in the only way I have ever known how to do - by disconnecting from everything but the creative act, and slowly but certainly reinstating the people I love, the rituals of self-care I need, the material things and consumables I find comfort within, surrounding myself with the joy and empathy that I know still exists in the world, the fairness and balance that I must create.\nThere's a lot here, not just in terms of runtime. There are sustained-tone drone pools to sink into, there are forever unfolding organ pieces, smeared Fast Fourier Transforms of humid sound-clouds, medical tone generators and shortwave radios alchemically transmuted, feedback tamed and bottled, echoes of strummed acoustic guitars reverberating through a cosmic hall, and so many different synthesizers singing and humming with scales and frequencies Euclidean, Pythagorean and otherwise. Imaginary surfaces resonating outward into imaginary spaces, digital piano keys blooming out of surrealistic flowers in a metallic garden, somnolent winds blown forth by the distant power of collapsing stars, baptizing entire galaxies with so much pink noise particulate.\nI sincerely hope that collecting these twenty broadcasts, and presenting them here in a linear and notated way, will help you to find them when and where you need them. Given the very harsh reality of many people's financial situation today, I am also soon adding this set and the prior 24xCD Vibra set to all the usual streaming platforms, such as Spotify, YouTube, iTunes etc. I realize that music is a luxury many cannot afford, but I always want to make it as easy as I can for mine to be available, and if I wasn't needing the dreaded dollar to keep my own head above water, know that I'd be doing this anyway, and giving it all away for free.\nSubscriptions are also still available for this series, in three tiers - $9.99 / $13.13 / $22.22 per month, which come with progressively larger amounts of beautiful ambient Milieu recordings, just for you. These denominations are likely the easiest and cheapest way, in the short term, to obtain a large amount of my ambient music, and subsequently one of the best ways to support it, so if you think you'd be interested in subbing, I'd have you anytime.  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  (As of this writing, new subscribers currently receive no less than 31 releases immediately upon subscribing!)",

            "about": "The third collection of Vibratelepathos arrives at the end of a mild Summer, and includes disc-length edits of broadcasts number forty-one through sixty, offering over twenty-four hours of audioholistic utility in the form of beatless generative ambient music.\nThe Vibratelepathos series has grown exponentially, in tandem with the continuous expansion of my studio hardware configuration and my R-EW Audioholistics modular synthesizer - the latter now occupying eight racks of space, a far cry from its small stature when the series was drafted in 2020. The various session headers, as I like to call them, refer to the primary voice or process explored on a given recording, and this method of titling formats has helped to organize the series as it expands, allowing newcomers and seasoned listeners alike to navigate the many pieces.\nIn this third volume of work, there are perennial sessions such as 'River Ores' (Karplus-Strong voices) and 'Greenest Grass' (the Grass Click-Tone Control Module), as well as a monolithic tripartite third iteration of 'The Color of an Echo' (feedback), but there are a few new session headers offered here as well: three iterations of 'Anichroma' (Yamaha TX81Z), two iterations of 'Blue Emerald Halftone (the Buchla 200 system), 'Earthly Branches' (Behringer's 921 oscillator, a recreation of the Moog System 55) and 'Fabled Key' (the Arturia Microfreak). The varied sources of these studies and patch explorations have yielded reams of colorful generative music, each piece unlike the last, and still somehow familiar, perhaps due to my own personal involvement.\nIt is thanks to these wildly different machines that I feel the Vibratelepathos series can continue without really repeating itself too much, and in some ways, it has now outgrown its original purpose of providing a calm disconnect from a crazy and upsetting outside world - it has managed to become a symbolist mirror of my studio processes, my philosophical interests and my creative curiosity. Looking back at these twenty-four sessions, it is plain to see the ground I've traveled across, and I sincerely hope that these sessions offer you some respite from the chaos and noise too.\nN.B. Vibratelepathos continues to offer a monthly subscription service for only $9.99 a month. Subscribers receive two public catalog releases per month, and one subscriber-exclusive private release as well. In addition, subscribers are granted immediate access to over forty subscriber-exclusive releases, plus the latest five public releases in the catalog, the moment they join the service. It is also worth noting here that these collected volumes of Vibra material use disc-length edits of the music in order to assemble the box sets, and quite often the subscription versions of the releases run for much longer than the length of a single CD.\nvibratelepathos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "'Wash the Hand' is not *the* new Milieu album, but it is *a* new Milieu album, in the grand tradition of \"music generated in a wild tangent during the frenzied creation of another entirely different work.\" It is a stopover, a rest stop with some well-stocked vending machines, a connecting flight en route to 'Watch the Head' and it was made, top to bottom, in under a week, in a self-imposed exercise of getting loose while the claws are still sharp, and following in the working template of earlier Milieu/CH contributions to the super fun Project 168 (wherein participants were given a start date and one week to create a brand new work - 'Simple Stations Repeat' and 'Giants in the Desert,' as well as the '1983' album from Coppice Halifax were recorded during such events).\nMusically, it contains a lot of stimmy sensory-seeking ADHD constructions, which is to say in layman's terms, so many dense sound events that it is not really possible to perceive them all in one go - and this is by design, where I feel a bit of camaraderie with the inimitable RDJ who said somewhere in an interview that he writes his tracks in such a way that he is able to be surprised by them when he listens back. It was years ago, and I could be entirely off thinking about it now, but that's the gist of what I've been doing here. There's also a bit of ridiculous nostalgia happening here, as six of the ten tracks offered were created in deprecated music software, with deprecated softsynths and effects processors that have not been updated or meant to be used in a DAW since a decade ago. Why? Because it's science, that's why!\nThe process of doing this was also a lot like 'Shallow Earth' was following the completion of 'Sun Cast' - a month of less-than-serious musicmaking following eight years of brow-furrowing surgically precise madness - and the idea was more or less that 1) it would be good for my brain to do something free-for-all and a little unhinged following the completion of 'Watch the Head' and 2) if anything golden really happened in the sessions, well, it wouldn't be too late to sneak it into 'Watch the Head' too. The latter did not end up happening, but 'Wash the Hand' still gives me enough of a purposeful vantage point from which to view 'Watch the Head' in a more favorable light. 'Wash the Hand' is the scruffy and disheveled Maynard Krebs with the caffeine jitters while 'Watch the Head' is the clean-cut but hopelessly lovesick Dobie Gillis, forever longing for the world beyond his own. (Apologies to those of you reading who are not as into 1959 teen sitcoms as much as I, it's a decent analogy though)\nThe cover art here is a real prize piece to me as well, having been done in under a week by the local wunderkind Greg Lawhun, a titan of visual storytelling who you may recognize from his work on the 10th anniversary 'Tidewater Petrol' reissue/remaster last year. Greg has been commissioned to create the visual world for 'Watch the Head' and of course, when this tangent appeared, graciously offered to work on something for 'Wash the Hand' to keep the visuals \"in universe\" between the two releases. It's a joyous riff on Blue Note jazz LPs I love, Maynard and Dobie (the sitcom teens as well as my two catto brothers who are named after them) and the illustrative style Greg and I both love from a number of different comic books. Greg would be bashful about being praised so highly, but he shouldn't be - 'Wash the Head' is a synaesthetically perfect blend of ideas and I owe him much more for that than I could ever afford to pay him (so buy this record so that I can pay Greg more!).\nSo this isn't the new album, it isn't a single and it's too long to be an adjacent EP, but it hopefully draws a cogent and enjoyable line from the 'Zaftig Lime' single to 'Watch the Head' itself when it lands later this month. There's a lot of references here, see how many you can find! I really hope that 'Wash the Hand' is as fun for you to skate through as it was for me to build it, but as usual, there's no right or wrong answers here. Your mileage may vary, the Dude abides, et al. A quick one while he's away!",

            "about": "\"One dreams in fire and works in clay.\"\n-Arthur Machen, 1922\n'Watch the Head' is the kind of album that, to me, comes on more like a season - a once or twice a year itch that I feel compelled to scratch, feeling like the generative modular work I tend toward more and more has again led me, perhaps predictably, to something composed and programmed.\nIt's a bit humorous to me to think that all of my music was made this way, in the earlier years, and I think I can draw a line around 'Sun Cast' as the moment where I realized that heavily composed work was now going to become something so exhausting and absolute that I could only really bear to do it once or twice in a calendar year. As I get older, I have realized that I am more than content to spend most of my time alone at sea, and in times like these, I feel called back to land, to civilization, to communion - but I always return to the unreachable horizon line beyond the sunny waves.\nThe albums that have followed that tack have slowly become more planned and plotted, refined and directed, and last year's 'The Flower to Disappear' felt very much to me like \"phase two\" of this approach to record making, where I'd set aside months of the year to devote almost completely to making *one* album, vacating the modular patch forests and generative curiosities to actually put pen to paper and *say* something again.\nSo, what is it that I wish to say? Having just turned forty a few months ago, I can unironically tell you that I don't think I've got much to say that I haven't said somewhere else before. 'Watch the Head' is not the best album I've ever made, nor does it strive to be (and certainly \"best\" is a rare word for me in these last few years, as I greatly dislike quantifying in absolutes), but it is the best album I can make right now. This is, as the I Ching might say, sufficient. \"Close enough for government work\" as the Brian of five or ten years ago would have said with a smirk.\nI think, for this push on the swing, the things I wish to say are not necessarily to you, Constant Listener, but to myself, albeit in the presence of friends who I feel have come to understand me and accept me. That would be you, any and all of you who have paid for a Milieu or CH album even once since 2005 - the fact that you've encouraged all of this has affected my decision to *continue* to do it, but after years of laboring over things, chasing tangents and reorienting myself, I've had a lot of time to consider what this act of expression really means to me.\nI've found that, generally, music that has been fashioned as something representative of where my mind is at a given point in time tends to succumb to an inevitable erosion of clarity - that given enough time, it simply becomes an object or a time capsule perhaps, and I think this is where and how I end up revisiting the process, trying to find myself inside it all over again - trying to excavate the statue from the stone.\nThis approach is a bit comedic, inherently, because I'll probably never get to some plateau point in my work where I feel that my work is finished, that I've built this monument and everything I feel is bound up within it. Instead, I am constantly falling behind myself, trying to catch up and perhaps outrun my work a little bit, and each time I feel that I've exhausted all my curiosity and made the best possible recording I can make, there's an inescapable sense that I'll always be back again, taping over what came before, defining the new definitive.\nSo here we are, together again at a branch in the path. It's always the same as before, and never the same, and if either of those statements were completely true, I question whether or not either of us would continue to care. There must be a feeling that something can be \"mostly true\" that we both understand, and we can feel it running through these tracks as surely as the path we're walking. Whether or not we can ever really be sure is just another thing to wonder about, but for now, let's laugh and enjoy each other's company while we can. I'm glad that you're you, and I feel content with being me, at least in this moment.",

This means that as the other elements in the track recur on the bar line in 4/4, the bassline never plays over those elements the same way a single time in the entirety of the track. In fact, the moment when the bassline *would* start again in the place it began is the moment the bassline ends the song. This was a challenge I gave myself for a long time, never quite succeeding, to write a song with verse/chorus type chord changes but with one bassline throughout that never recurs. After years of attempts, 'Eudian Proxemics' materialized from thin air in about two hours. It is both the simplest composition on the album and, for me, one of the most profound I've ever had the pleasure to write.",

            "about": "Two extended ambient suites composed for the video game Eufloria during the winter of 2008. Recorded using several treated loops and melodic motifs recorded for the soundtrack, in tandem with FX devices and cassette tape. Resulting in pieces that were longer and more atmospheric than most of the material on the soundtrack, this album was given a short and intimate release via a limited edition CD-R that was gifted to parties who helped fund Brian Grainger's trip to the Independent Games Festival in San Francisco, where Eufloria was nominated for the Seumas McNally award, a full year after these tracks were recorded. Until now, this album has remained unavailable in any form and has collected a few years of dust in Brian's studio. Trainspotters may notice that shorter versions of these tracks appear on the double-album soundtrack, albeit with rhythmic accompaniment and other textural overdubs that are not present on the original pieces presented here.",

            "about": "While working on several different sessions throughout the second half of 2021, all focused upon the exploration of my recently acquired Roland Juno 106 synthesizer, I'd accumulated a large amount of material that was recorded either for signal tests or rehearsal takes, or simply experiments with new patches that deviated from whatever the primary goal was at that moment in time. My growing and esoteric modular system has stepped into a more active role in reprocessing any and all audio such as this, informally recorded or flawed in some other way, and removing it from a cutting-room-floor fate, instead transfiguring and elevating it into something entirely new.\nSo now, offered here in periphery with the White Alice sessions at Vibratelepathos (see:  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com/album/white-alice-i-ii  ) are the White Alice Variations - the recognizable sound of the Juno, weathered and sometimes distantly recalled through the myriad channels and processing paths of my R-EW Audioholistics system, as well as FX devices such as the Alesis Quadraverb, Danelectro Reel Echo and Lexicon Alex. This is a visage of White Alice displaced, transplanted, partially dissolved and regenerated by memory - a bell rung in a mountain top lighthouse, vibrations carried across waves, woods and fields, to be absorbed by the clouds and vaporized by the golden sun.",

            "about": "'Winter Displacement' is an unanticipated counterpoint to the second Sleepbuilding broadcast from 2022 - 'A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods' - which collects two deep variations of the source material by Downscope and Coppice Halifax.\nAlthough there has been re-visitation and reprocessing of Sleepbuilding material prior to this, until now it has always remained beatless, and 'Winter Displacement' offers an Impressionistic deep techno perspective on the seemingly endless and generative Milieu session at its core.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that this is the first new Coppice Halifax work to be published since 2023's 'Blue Cloak' (discounting of course the extensive experimental session work at Deep Earth, which remains a separate pocket universe of music all its own), likely owing to the fact that 'Watch the Head' and the Sleepbuilding series largely consumed my creative energy for most of 2023. With this new piece, the hope is that more CH recordings can and will continue as the year moves on, but I can never tell where or when things will happen, so we will just have to wait and see.\nIn any case, I am grateful to Downscope for having taken the time to explore his curiosities within the framework of my Milieu broadcast, and I appreciate his patience while I worked out the best way to present this variation to you, as it is already almost a year old now. I think 'Winter Displacement' is a perfect companion to the gradually warming Winter weather as Spring creeps in, and it is my first non-beatless work of the '24 year, so I hope you'll join us here at our small camp in the cold woods, waiting on the sun to come up.\nFor more Downscope:  downscope.bandcamp.com\nFor more CH:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "As the Summer wound down to its appointed end, I spent about a week processing some very potent thoughts, after a meeting with someone left me with a tangle of unresolved emotions, primarily involving mortality, and the loss of awareness as it approached. Much within the art world has been done in the name of trying to grapple with mortality, and the degradation of human memory, and this triptych of recordings is not attempting to say anything new or particularly profound about it. It is simply my way of coming to terms with things that are not normally brought so directly before me in my day to day life. I meditated, I wrote a poem, I wrote another poem, and then I recorded this session. It felt like enough. It would have to be, because I prefer to use any creative mechanisms I possess or have access to in order to figure out how I really feel about something, in order to keep myself from fixating on it, letting something like grief, depression or worry self-oscillate and spin out into something more mountainous.\nThe sessions sat unnamed on my hard drive for a while, and all last month I considered them in the back of my mind, feeling that they were appropriate for the onset of Autumn weather, texturally speaking, but they still remained bereft of any finer details that elevate the mundane to the meaningful. They were named, then they were renamed, then I left the work again to consider the changes, until returning to it now, discovering almost too quickly the real identity of these pieces.\nThey have been renamed a second time, with a phrase that I mindlessly uttered aloud one night walking along the sidewalk, looking at the fluttering blanket of orange leaves that now covered my front yard. I laughed and wondered what it meant, and then realized what it meant, and felt as if I'd simply quoted someone. No online searching turned anything up, and so it is with many of my titles that arrive in a purely subconscious way, that there are always processes in motion somewhere in my creative mind, things that even I am unaware of, meanings I know, but bury or ignore or simply cannot detect until a window opens and they are allowed to surface, like driftwood wrested free of an ancient shipwreck beneath a stormy sea.\nPerhaps this is evidence of whatever mental defragmentation I underwent, by way of my writing and my modular patching, that the system works, albeit without a time table, and I have once again transmuted grief into gold. After some time away from these sessions, I find them much more comforting than they felt at the time, pouring out of so many cables and pulsing lights. They feel like a complete thought, a literal beginning middle and end, and now they should be published so that the public may read and write into them what it will. I have given you my reasons for making them, but you should have your own reasons for listening to them, and you do, whether you know that or not. I'm hopeful that they will add to your day or night, rather than subtract from it, and as always, it never ceases to surprise me the variance of fruits borne from my strange modular tree, and I am thankful to be so lucky, to have such useful tools within my grasp, when and where I need them.",

            "about": "\"This time, I have left my body behind me, crying\nIn its dark thorns.\nStill,\nThere are good things in this world.\nIt is dusk.\nIt is the good darkness\nOf women's hands that touch loaves.\nThe spirit of a tree begins to move.\nI touch leaves.\nI close my eyes and think of water.\"\n-James Wright, 'Trying to Pray' (1963)\n---\nIt's been a very intense month here, for me alone, and it's been an even more intense month out there around the world for many of you. There is a lot on my mind, far too much to write, far too many things to even begin to think about, so instead, as I often do, I turn to my work, my machines, to comforting things like weed and baseball and video games and car rides. This month's Sleepbuilding release is perfectly emblematic of the needs it addresses and the time and place it has been published - the cover image reflecting the paper of the book it was scanned from in a soft wavering grey noise, the edges of all the tones in the music slightly fuzzed with bad grounding in my studio. Who knew that clear air would truly be this difficult to find?\nAnyway, this is the 38th Sleepbuilding broadcast - very nearly so late in its issuance that it emerged in July instead of June as scheduled - recorded back in 2023 (the oldest of the yet-unpublished sessions, and selected for only this reason) shortly after I was lucky enough to acquire a Korg Poly 800 polyphonic synthesizer from 1983 as an unexpected Xmas gift to myself. This machine went on to sire the Vibra sessions \"Ranges Undreamt\" and has already appeared all over so much of my music (often responsible for the thick and angular bass work in Milieu and CH jams). It is one of my favorite machines of all time, and exists alongside the Juno 106 (thanks Ross!) as a sort of alternative universe version of that machine, as both utilize digital oscillators with analog filtering, as well as different yet incredibly lush chorus effects. If I were to choose between the two, I would have to still pick the Juno, simply because the Juno's keybed is possibly the best keybed I've ever played, and because Roland had better MIDI integration at that time than Korg did. Moving on...\n\"Clear Air\" consists of the Poly 800 being sequenced via the Arturia Keystep Pro, in the good old major pentatonic scale. From there, the signal of the Poly 800 was routed through my modular system, where it was processed by Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay, Noise Engineering's Multi Versio (in Lo-Fi mode) and resampled by two different iterations of Mutable Instruments' Clouds. Additional low pass filters were used by 2hp and Doepfer, and tempo modulation was handled by the usual array of Boolean gates, Doepfer divider and Cute Labs' Missed Opportunities.\nAll of this amounts to a warm and spacious atmosphere of simple melodies in close-focus and even simpler lead elements further out in the distance, with the tempo of the piece never really settling into one direct linear path. Instead it simply floats around in the stereo field, like particles of dust in a sunbeam, and I like this effect a lot. It feels very disconnected from reality, and yet, quite naturalistic despite that.\n---\nAll Sleepbuilding releases remain FREE to download for everyone everywhere.

            "about": "'Zaftig Lime' is the first single for/from the forthcoming new Milieu album Watch the Head and carries with it three non-album tracks as b-sides, which hopefully give listeners some idea of what to expect from the album, even though (paradoxically) b-sides are outtakes and therefore recordings that did not make the cut for qualitative reasons, so in this sense, your mileage may vary.\nPedantic needling aside, 'Zaftig Lime' is full to the brim with all the Summer Milieu tropes that you probably know by now - happy-sad melodies, bouncy rhythms with lots of stimmy detailing, loads of basslines that blur the boundaries between lead and support instruments, sun-baked chords emanating from tape-warped keyboards. Altogether, there isn't anything entirely new offered here at a topical level, and that suits me just fine. Comfort and familiarity come at the cost of not breaking new ground at every turn, but with that said, I do feel like a lot of the progress I've tried to make with my compositions is happening at a deeper level, affecting arrangements and metric designs and spatial definitions. Who knows? (The Shadow knows)\nAs I write this now, on the last day of July, I am still in the midst of shaping and finishing Watch the Head, which I wanted to be completed by now, but it's difficult to give yourself constant challenges in what your work *is* and have those fairly align with when that work *happens* - so, onward we go. 'Zaftig Lime' is more of a progress report than an extract from a completed work, something etched into a tree in this winding forest that's placed here just as much for my navigational sake as it is for your orientation.\nSo, please enjoy this scatterbrained set of Summer jams. I'm fond of each of them for one or several reasons, but aside from the title track, these are little scenic jaunts off the main path that are pleasantly diverting, as my wife would say. For the \"too long, didn't read\" crowd - imagine if Shallow Earth, Housewares and The Flower to Disappear had a mutant baby, and you're probably pretty close. ☕",

            "about": "Commissioned for the video game ZEN in Spring 2015, which is currently available on iOS for you Apple users out there, this twelve-track album is a cleanly produced braindance effort, designed to complement ZEN's minimalistic purple and white interface and basic operation, with tracks ranging from the placid to the frantic as the game's difficulty level heightens. As a reference point, longtime Milieu listeners would be able to connect the ZEN soundtrack to previous records like Academy Stripes, Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker and the Phe_ album - all of which just so happened to be released at Recycled Plastics, making this album's appearance in the RP catalog a no-brainer. To be sure, there are moments on this record that are absolutely the spiritual successor to the Phe_ album, so perhaps it's best to be considered in that light, outside of its original and intended context.\nYou can learn more about ZEN here:\nzen.gansrigler.com",

            "about": "\"But the flower leaned aside\nAnd thought of naught to say,\nAnd morning found the breeze\nA hundred miles away.\"\n-Robert Frost, excerpt from \"Wind and Window Flower\"\nLike 'Creation' and 'A Small Fire in the Snowy Woods' preceding it, 'Zephyrean' is a long-form generative ambient work totaling fifteen hours, which was broadcast live as it came into being from the evening of February 9th to the afternoon of February 10th, 2023. The weather throughout the day on the 9th consisted of heavy winds that bowed my house in different directions, animating the metal chimes in my kitchen window with a constant frenzy, and so this patch developed in unison with that atmosphere, although it has been presented only partially, with the sound of the wind, the feeling in the air and the glittering metal chimes not reproduced as part of the recording.\nIn the week leading up to this, I'd been exhausted by a heavy grief that hung over me like a shadow, which finally relented and resolved itself as the wind blew through the valley. It felt cathartic, to be able to really breathe freely again, and to have the world inhaling and exhaling along with me. As it usually tends to be, my modular system and the sound it unspools are particularly useful mechanisms for processing emotional and physical stress, and so 'Zephyrean' was both a reaction to the receding shadows and the colorful weather, as well as a presence all its own that filled in the empty spaces between these ideas and events.\nI enjoy broadcasting these sessions as well, if only for the secondary effect they have on the voyeuristic participants who can look into my studio with curiosity, and hopefully then a sense of calm disconnection. Many such listeners have remarked to me during these broadcasts that they wish they'd go on forever, that they enjoy being able to drop in and out of them as if they were a radio station somewhere, and so it is all the more fruitful for me to polish them up afterward, and publish them here free of charge. It brings me so much joy to know that this system of machines that I've arranged in such an esoteric way can provide similar comforts to people I've never met, will never see or know, regardless of their geographical location, language or perspective.\nI am continually in a state of two minds about creative acts such as these, however. In one sense, there is a duty to know yourself and have something cogent to say when you decide to express yourself, etched into the stone for all artists, baked into our minds as they are still forming their understanding of this work, and I don't necessarily disagree with it. While there is always room for \"art for art's sake,\" the richer experiences are always going to be those that are designed with a sense of purpose or interactive usage. On the other hand, when I am dealing in such abstracts as these long-form broadcasts, with my machines operating on a deep well filled with my own decisions, using those to generate their musical shapes in real-time without any additional input from me, there is a very real sense that even I do not yet know what these things could mean - that for artistic purpose to be fulfilled, it must first be defined by a meaning of some kind - and if I do not yet understand that meaning, does this mean the music is without any purpose? Is it uncouth of me to release this ambiguity upon the rest of the world?\nOr is this simply the nature of things, both human and artistic? That there is never a rigid relationship between the artist, the work and the world they inhabit - that these things are not plateaus but gradients, and understanding can only come where and when it is naturally in alignment between those three things. It begs the question: Is something more or less useful if its purpose is only revealed over an indeterminate amount of time? And with extended, and operatively endless, works like 'Zephyrean,' is the amount of time these things require to fully communicate their purpose relative to how much runtime they actually occupy?\nI don't really have any answers to any of these questions, but in the end, I don't think I need to. The work can exist as a monument outside of me, outside of my understanding, even if I am the person who allowed it to exist in the first place. I relish this superposition, this state of ambivalence I am allowed to work within, where generative and procedural art are accommodating. It feels enthralling to be a passenger, like yourselves, rather than holding the reins of some wild horse that I pretend to hold dominion over. The truth is, I've never made anything - it's just happened.\n---\nTwelve hours of the original broadcast have been archived here on my YouTube channel.
