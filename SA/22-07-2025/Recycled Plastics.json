            "about": "Having not released any new music for almost ten years, Blaubac has returned from the wilderness with visions of the void and exposure to mutagenic radiation. What has emerged is almost unrecognizable, a strange construct of man and machine, bound together via alien systems of symbiosis. Here, he issues eleven arrangements of modular synthesis and windswept isolationism - tracks that run like mechanical tattoos across atom blasted landscapes, beneath a cracked-glass sun that spills purples, oranges and greens out over the bubbling atmosphere. Somewhere, inside all of the winding pathways of metallic installations, seeps a melancholic haze - a blank sadness that echoes the loss of self among the deserted cities and black salt deserts. These visions never resolve themselves, the sonic messages never reach their terminus...instead, they clamber on, lurching endlessly forward through the wreckage of the past, assimilating pieces they find useful along the way, and abandoning all else. Hopeless probes forever wandering/wondering, blinking cursors on dim greenscreens, failed programs, derelict seeds without purpose.",
            "credits": "released July 6, 2018\nW/P by Chris Smith. Created with modular synthesizer, direct to stereo in a single take, with no editing in post. Thoughtfully mastered by The Analog Botanist at the White Pillar Workshop. Design and text by ABM&D. This is Recycled Plastics number BC68, and 68th in the Bedroom Compost catalog.",

            "about": "Fresh out of a victorious battle for the Egret's Crystal, NN* returns with completely replenished HP and MP and a lovely addition to the ACID SUMMER. His trademark ice cream truck melodies take precedence over the electro-fantasy drum grooves, and A Heart Is A Forest is catchy enough to get even the bridge troll to start breakdancing. While this is an EP, there is a special limited edition CD-R component that contains FOUR additional tracks, effectively making it a brand new full-length album! A perfect compliment to your rainbow icepops!",

            "about": "Sliding comfortably into BC45 is a sugar-sweet EP from Gene Mantua, warmly titled A Place For Us. Gene's released only one other EP before this - Moon-Glo All Skate at Sequel Sound - but that shouldn't sway you. The sounds here are familiar and feel-good electronics, the very foundation upon which RP was conceived. Somehow, on only 7 tracks, Gene manages to make us recall Autechre's Amber and Squarepusher's Weird Things, while also channeling the emotive strains from things like Fieldtriqp, Am-Boy, early Ten and Tracer and so on. We don't know how he does it, but A Place For Us really feels like home. Thanks, Gene.\nFor maximum effect, check out the limited edition CD-R, which contains a rare remix of \"Days On Nights\" from Milieu!",

            "about": "The sophomore release as Troth at Recycled Plastics is Abmho Penthousing. As previously mentioned when Combs Hydros came out, Troth is a project centered around using acoustic instruments and acoustic room environments in tandem with analog tape and various types of electronic devices. TR1 was the most conventional sounding example, so it was released first. Now, TR2 begins to feel out more of the exploratory sounds Troth was meant for. The thumb pianos, plucked strings, bells and metal bowls are all still present, but the tracks themselves are far more organic and fractured things. Acoustic room reverbs and all manner of textural noise mingle around with drum machines gone spastic/plastic, while delays, flangers and modulators crumple up the melodies like trashed pieces of notebook paper. Abmho Penthousing is a playful EP that sits perfectly within the Recycled Plastics ethos.",
            "credits": "released November 25, 2012\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Botany Bay, 2011-2012. This is Recycled Plastics number TR2.",

            "about": "As Milieu reaches its 9th year as a project, what better way to celebrate but with a brand new record? Academy Stripes is Milieu's 36th full-length album of original material, and the first at Recycled Plastics. So what should you expect to hear? A colorful assortment of happy-sad melodies in about a dozen different flavors, cast like a sunbeam over energetic drum machine programming and funky bass that floats elegantly like sex in space. The trademark attributes of the Milieu sound are still there - lots of creative detuning, analog signal processing and a focus on psychedelics that should bring a smile to just about anyone. Carefree feel-good music is complemented by elements of dualities (or maybe even stripes) that are noticeable in both the music and the track titles. Right on time for the Summer, released on Brian's 30th birthday, and ready to lovingly caress large and small speakers everywhere.",
            "credits": "released May 17, 2013\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Botany Bay, 2011-2013. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Album design by Eric Adrian Lee. A knowing wink, secret handshake and friendly high-five to Richard on track #8. Thanks to Herc, Hastings, Japp and Lemon. This is Recycled Plastics number RP5.",

            "about": "DR Phlux is the newest standard issue rhythm machine at Recycled Plastics, known by other designators as Koré and Phoen. Hailing from Warsaw, DR Phlux specializes in rubbery low end filled with fatty acids and beats that won't repeat on you after dinner. ACID SCENTS is the first of several new releases from this Polish wunderkind, blasting your summer off the map with a white hot acid laser. Throughout this release you will surf the soundwaves happily through warm fronts of tape hiss and vanishing point delays, with just as much sentimentality weaving through the melodies as there is swank. And as you know, it don't mean a think if it ain't got that swank.\nPick up the CD-R version for 4 bonus Phlux trax plus a bouncy remix by MILIEU to prop that sleepy last quarter up, and also be sure to check out the recently reissued/expanded TRANSACIDS CD-R by Koré!",
            "credits": "released September 11, 2016\nW/P by DR Phlux. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC 51 and 51st in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "The reclusive Mr. Acid returns from an extended undercover top-secret acid mission, where he is rumored to have spent a year moonlighting as a bell clerk at a luxurious hotel in Moscow...or was it Moldova? We'll never know. All we're given is a discreet unmarked folder filled with aerial surveillance photos, xeroxed receipts for pizza and a suspicious looking disc containing thirteen more audio files, which are presented here. On Acid Styles, Mr. Acid widens his range a bit, and we see him playfully making tracks that are only slightly longer than the ADD channel-changers on Squawk! and Techno Box. As such, things get a little more funky, a little more rubbery, maybe even a little glossy (!) but never straying very far from his comfortable pH level. We were going to save this one for the next Acid Summer marathon, but fuck it - this record needs to be heard! Felt! Fondled! Seen to be believed! Don't take our word for it, take some acid.",

            "about": "Brother Blue, the deep dub techno side of Tim Gray (aka Ethernet, Tanuki House) returns to Recycled Plastics with a lush hour-long live recording of his set in Portland on June 24, 2016, at Moonchild's Odyssey space. This lovely recording came to us mastered by the man himself, with the intent to have it issued freely on the Summer Solstice. Crafted masterfully with Gray's live hardware rig, which consisted of his Elektron Analog Rytm, MFB-522 and DSI Tetra in conjunction with several FX units and a cassette Walkman prepped with what Gray describes as \"cosmic hiss.\" Enjoy this grooving walk through a PDX dub haze, on the advent of Summer - this one's on us.",

            "about": "An Expensive Vase is the first of several scheduled albums by Media Them at Recycled Plastics. The sound of Media Them is a unique blend of warm atmospherics and organic rhythms - electronic music reduced to the simplest of loops, repeating infinitely. It is both minimalist and maximalist at once, as Media Them's composition lies not in the makeup of these loops, but rather, the size of the window we're glimpsing them through. Small breaths of melody, heart flutters of bass, snare and hi hat and the coziest bedroom production give way to expanding universes of color and sonic exploration without end. Did that sound just repeat one more time than it did before? Was that other sound even playing since the start of the track? Media Them beckons you to refocus your ears and get lost in a beautiful hypnosis of music and mind.\nWe've been so obsessed with Media Them music since discovering it, that there is now an exclusive catalog subset reserved only for Media Them records. These albums will be free to download, but super-limited edition CD-R runs of 25 copies each will be available as well. We'd like you to reserve a special space on your record shelf for the Media Them collection - we know that we certainly will.",

            "about": "Sometimes, music makes itself, or at least it seems to. Antauen began with inspiration striking Argentinian producer Matias Bagato (aka Orson Throb, and one of the minds behind Temiong Recordings) to remix the Coppice Halifax track \"Antu\" from Radians (RP4). This mix was simply too good to let it fall by the wayside, so within a week of hearing it, we drafted the help of French producer Zwei Kreise (previously known as Axs) to fill out what would be a spontaneous single. Coppice Halifax went back to the source sounds for \"Antu\" as well, bringing into existence ANTAUEN, a heavy new track that slices through the original audio with a white-hot laser, ready to storm the decks. Once the leading single and the supporting mixes were laid out, tangents began to manifest, and both Zwei Kreise and Coppice Halifax went even deeper into \"Antu\" to excavate three more mixes: ZK's being a low-res nod to vintage game soundtracking, and CH's being a 40-minute drone-techno monolith with a washed out reprise. These experimental extras are only available as bonus tracks on the CD-R version of Antauen, which fully adds up to 71 minutes of new sound for your ears to process. Grab BC46 and thaw yourself out in deep space today.",

            "about": "AQV, named for the Alesis Quadraverb FX unit it was principally recorded with, begins the Bedroom Compost series with a three-track EP. At times soft like velour and at times as jagged as a rusty bucket, the AQV EP travels melodic 90's braindance terrain rather effortlessly, recalling the nostalgic olden days of full-size monitors, dialup modems and non-wireless video game console controllers. Heavily inspired by the early Rephlex and Warp catalogs, AQV's music should fit comfortably alongside those blurry memories of the electronic renaissance.",
            "credits": "released October 16, 2011\nW/P by AQV. Recorded at Foxhill. This is Recycled Plastics number BC1, and first in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "In the end of 2018, I was commissioned by Sebastian Gansrigler, the creative mind behind the ZEN mobile game and 'Die Letzt Kupferdrucker' (a short documentary film about Europe's last copper printer in Vienna), to provide musical score, sound effects and transitional sound material for a series of advertising campaign videos that would introduce his boutique photography magazine Auslöser. Having previously provided scoring work for both ZEN (whose soundtrack resides here at RP) and 'Kupferdrucker', I was elated to work with Sebastian once again on another new and entirely different project.\nAuslöser is a beautifully minimalist photography magazine that is printed in Austria biannually. It can be purchased in over 50 carefully selected galleries, museum shops, magazine- and bookstores worldwide from Vienna to Russia, from Portugal to China, and as a single edition and subscription direct from Auslöser's website. Furthermore, you can find every issue at many universities and in libraries from Zurich to Amsterdam.\nMusically, the sounds presented here are almost entirely sketches and palette-tests that would serve as liminal progress markers toward what ended up being refined and utilized in Auslöser marketing actions. Many of the recordings are completely informal and are presented here less as 'music' in a composed sense, and more as an interesting insight into my scoring process, patchmaking and perhaps even as a document of one of the more unique commissions that have come my way. Everything was created using a Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer, except the 'Tanzmix' which was built alongside samplers, drum machines and overdubs using the Minilogue in different patch configurations, to provide a \"single\" for this otherwise noncommercial album...although it is somewhat ironic that music drafted for actual commercial use ends up presented more as library music than anything you'd typically find in modern advertising otherwise.\nAuslöser Kunststoffe, or \"Shutter Button Plastics\", would likely appeal to fans of my Eufloria or ZEN soundtrack recordings, as well as Milieu albums like Improvisations For Hylian Piano & Woodwinds (also recorded using the same polysynth), Daughter or Quebrith & Yarrow.",

            "about": "Following his psychedelic opus ON DOING/BEING ORDINARY, Foamek returns with a \"single\" for the album cut AVALON, which runs no less than 78 minutes, packed like a car full of stoned teenagers with tape hiss blanketed techno tangents. Foamek himself turns in two alternate mixes of Avalon, backed by three non-album tracks (one of which was previously issued on a charity compilation) that further expand his unique voice with bittersweet melodies, nostalgic sound palette and an undeniable dance beat. Closing out the set is a 17 minute Coppice Halifax remix that warps, detunes and recontextualizes Avalon into a pastoral Summer feelgood, and for a special treat, listeners who pick up the limited edition CD-R will also get a second CH remix (clocking in at 34 minutes!) that recalls influences like Yagya, Pub and the Chain Reaction catalogue. Look no further - Foamek has the sound of your Summer days and nights both covered!",

            "about": "Substak's Beatless comes at a perfect time seasonally, with the current weather here consisting of cold days, showers and leafless trees. Beatless is an exercise in depth and dimension, showcasing Substak's talents for crafting alien sonics and ominous atmospherics. While Beatless is devoid of a kick drum, it is not entirely arrhythmic. There are occasional bits of hi hat, or the noticeable angles of a looped sequence, or even an oscillating pattern that pulses in time. In this way, it almost sounds as if Substak is at odds with his music, and rather than creating it wholesale, he is actually conjuring up elemental forces and doing his best to rein them in. What we're left with is all cold - cold sheets of droning fog that hint at icy dub-inspired chord structures buried beneath them, cold track titles that separate any artistic intent from the sound you hear and replace it with a simple number. Cold silence before, between and after tracks, itself a black nameless void that Substak lures his sounds out of before marking them as his own and exiling them back to wherever they came from. This, along with the Monophon album by Mon0, is the deepest Recycled Plastics has dared to dive in the Bedroom Compost series so far. There's enough exploration here for you to stay in bed for a week.\nThe limited edition CD-R includes a special 17 minute Coppice Halifax remix as a bonus track.",
            "credits": "released January 12, 2015\nW/P by Kostas Staikos. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC35, and 35th in the ongoing Bedroom Compost catalog set.",

            "about": "It's finally Summertime, but press play, close your eyes and you'd never be able to tell. Lamont Kohner's third single for RP lands with a roomy bass pulse and a dusty loop that slowly splits open to reveal white noise-crusted dub chords and a thumping traincar rhythm. BECKONS does what it says on the tin, with minimal side effects, drawing us into the seedy nightlife of Kohner's noir cityscapes and neon vapors. Following the irresistible groove of BECKONS is CLOSE IT, a slightly more traditional dub techno affair, recalling the Detroit strains of Deepchord and Echospace while also conjuring a thick-as-a-brick rhythmic foundation that goes even further back to the first couple Maurizio 12\"s in Germany. The whole thing congeals into that trademark Kohner shuffle, and we're once again sitting back in a darkened taxi, window half open, smoke wafting out into the greasy streets. Falling beneath the music's spell, you feel compelled to close the window - we're doing something intimate in here.",

            "about": "Milieu returns to Recycled Plastics, bearing a new catalog of improvisations and excerpts from live performances. Bismuth Cosmolog will consist of tracks (or sections) taken from live Milieu sets, which Brian felt were better off in these isolated pieces than as a part of a longer session. Since the process of Milieu sets is ongoing, so too will the series be.\nThis first volume opens with the namesake track, a 14-minute exploration on only two pieces of hardware (a Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer and a Teenage Electronics PO-12 drum machine). Phasing from melodic braindance bounce to something more plaintive and calm, it leaves the door wide open for Friday Night Lazer, a rehearsal of the live set that has since been released as Saturday Night Lazer at Milieu Music. In some ways, Friday is the \"single version\" of Saturday, although it's a little more spaced out in the lead lines than its companion. Friday was created using four Korg Volca machines (Bass/Beats/Keys/Sample). The two Age Onyx tracks originated from a quite heavy test session for the Minilogue and PO-12, with the latter playing ping-pong with an Alesis Quadraverb's sampler mode and a Synthrotek PT2399, to really fuck everything up. Bismuth Beats is a single piece, split into two distinct sections, that further mutates the same sequences and patches used on the title track.\nBismuth Cosmolog will be a simple but funky series of live curiosities and snapshots of moments where the vibrations in the air seemed to be mingling just right. Originating from live recordings means these tracks are best enjoyed very loud on a stereo system with substantial low end output!",

Since the process of Milieu sets is ongoing, so too will the series be.\nThis second volume opens with Phronesis, a funky and offbeat jam recorded on Brian's wife's birthday with a Boss DR-110 drum machine controlling four Korg Volca machines (Bass/Beats/Keys/Sample), a Teenage Electronics PO-12 and a Korg Minilogue polyphonic analog synthesizer. The two Oxy cuts were also taken from this same live set, themselves ever stranger iterations of the same machines and patches. Mint Gel is a short but sweet bubbly analog braindance track, and (as the title would indicate) Mint Dub manages to reduce it to a shuffle and some reverberated dub spatter. Both of the Mint tracks were generated using the 4x Volcas, Minilogue, Arturia Microbrute, Teenage Electronics PO-12, Korg MS-20 and a Roland SH-32. Finally, the Red Lamp tracks are from a more minimalistic set from late 2017, using only the four Volcas to build up their sequenced psychedelia.\nBismuth Cosmolog will be a simple but funky series of live curiosities and snapshots of moments where the vibrations in the air seemed to be mingling just right.

            "about": "AQV returns with a second volume of bedroom electronics, following the first-ever Bedroom Compost release back in 2011. Blue Machine is a textured and mid-fi trip through an aquatic realm, wedged somewhere between the ending sequence from Splash and King Trident's kingdom in The Little Mermaid. Equal parts VHS defocus and analog synthesizer improvisation, Blue Machine conjures up waves and waves of sonic seawater to swim around in, in this ACID SUMMER. Performed live on equipment that all had the color blue present somewhere on its enclosure, with zero computers or overdubs present, direct to a fuzzy cassette tape on an old JVC deck.\nAdditionally, the limited edition CD-R comes with a special 18-minute bonus track, \"A Late One While She's Awake\", which features (gasp!) psychedelic electric guitar playing and three-string bass playing by guest Plastician Casio Commander.",
            "credits": "released July 9, 2019\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded live at White Pillar, May 13 2017, using the following hardware: Roland SH-32, Boss DR-110, Memphis Blue Beat, Casio MT-210, Moog Ring Modulator, Alesis Quadraverb, Ibanez Phase Modulator, Boss RV-3. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC77, and #77 in the Bedroom Compost subcatalog.",

            "about": "It is with great pleasure and eagerness that Recycled Plastics is able to introduce the listening world to Demi Odessa, a talented young man who has managed to create one of the best Summer albums we've ever heard. BODY MEMORY is notable not only because it is the first RP release to feature vocals, but because it embodies a beautiful confluence of youthful melancholy, seasonal playfulness, lo-fi charm and incredibly measured restraint. Elements of Demi Odessa can be traced all over the place, from warm tape-decked house music to minimal techno, from 1990's trip hop records to classical synthpop - it's all present, natural and unforced. Body Memory sounds easy, accessible and plays to both down and up moods at all the right points, still never letting the curtain pull back so much that we ever get a clear picture of the person behind it.\nKeen listeners note: The limited edition CD-R comes with a disc-exclusive bonus track - a Milieu remix of \"Don't\" that displaces Odessa's lonesome vocals into a SAW 85-92 pool of bittersweetness for night-time cough syrup relaxation...",
            "credits": "released August 13, 2018\nW/P by Demi Odessa, except #12: Written by Demi Odessa / Produced & remixed by Milieu. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Text and design by ABM&D. This is Recycled Plastics number BC70, and 70th in the ongoing Bedroom Compost catalogue.",

            "about": "As the wizard behind the curtain here at Recycled Plastics, I tend to wear many different hats (wizard-shaped and otherwise), including curator, designer, mastering guru, shipping and fulfillment gopher, on-call remixer, material assembler, copy writer and sarcastic internet shitposter. Beyond all of these, however, I'm living many different lives issuing my own music under more than a dozen different names, in addition to my birthname - some are public, some are...not, but all of them maintain differences in one or more ways.\nUntil now, there's never been a single release to corral together many of these disparate projects, but BOREDOM COMPOSED attempts to reconcile all of these varied musical profiles I've maintained through the years, and assemble them into a cogent compilation album, inspired by similarly-minded things like GPO's \"Jack The Tab\" and \"Tekno Acid Beat\" compilations, Wolfgang Voigt's many releases in this vein at Profan and even things like Basic Channel and Echospace issuing albums with multiple artistic attributions given for the same group of producers. This album is a crossroads, a terminus point where 11 of my different aliases meet each other at a party organized by me, Brian Grainger.\nMusically, BOREDOM COMPOSED is a perfect embodiment of many of the genre facets of Recycled Plastics - melodic braindance, bedroom production, sample riffing, dubby techno, jungle spastics and psychedelic ambient passages. Ideally, this is an album that will appeal to everyone, at least momentarily, although it would be a real success to bring together people who may not otherwise buy a ticket to the same show. It is the result of years of work and meticulous organization, an attempt at recording A-side quality tracks for each moniker and still keeping some level of consistency and album flow between them.\nSo, to send off 2019 with a tip of the many hats I wear, BOREDOM COMPOSED is a fun and heartfelt 90-minute mixtape from my bedroom to yours. Here's to a better year in 2020 - log off, unplug and blissfully ignore with me through these twelve escapist fantasies, because the world outside of our bedrooms? That shit will rot your brain. Life is a beautiful thing, as long as you hold the string.\nDEDICATIONS:\n#2 for MC Urine Gone\n#3 for Stephen Hitchell\n#5 for Erik 333\n#7 for L.O.P.\n#8 for Atoll Intercom Systems\n#9 for JPK\n#10 for Boris The Kat\n#11 for Plastic Log\n#12 for James Kirby",

            "about": "The shadowy figure known as Lamont Kohner returns to Recycled Plastics, after disappearing into a smoky alleyway one night in 2016. He carries with him the new single BROKEN, a classic Kohner cut full of high-pressure bass, monstrous kick drums and dub stabs soaked in greasy city rain. A swirling neon romp that brings to mind equal parts dark dancefloor and film noir detective stories. Backing BROKEN is the equally heavy TENSOR, a hypnotic subway train of metallic rhythms and bass pulse, which passes through the underbelly of the city BROKEN lays claim to, echoing creaks and disembodied voices through pipe systems and black tunnels.",

            "about": "Butcher Block Andromeda (graciously christened by Kirk Marrison of Kiln) represents a decade of Milieu music, from its inauguration in May of 2004 to its 10th anniversary celebration in May of 2014. Fifty tracks, carefully selected from dozens of albums, EPs, singles and compilations, lovingly remastered (and in some cases appended for time) to be presented here in this thorough and detailed \"beginner's guide\". Across the three-disc, four-hour affair, we hear facets of all the various phases Milieu has gone through over the years - from the mid-fi melodies over slow tempos to the house and techno-inflected groovers, from the glitchy atmospheric pieces to the deep ambient odysseys, right on up to present day Milieu, a playful bedroom braindance sound. For both longtime listeners and new recruits, Butcher Block Andromeda should be a fresh and colorful experience of vibrant electronic music, newly minted with a 2014 paint job.\n**The digital download also includes seven bonus high-resolution Milieu desktop wallpapers, designed by Eric Adrian Lee.",

            "about": "Troth arrives at Recycled Plastics with the first of two EPs, Combs Hydros. As you might guess from the sound of the tracks, Troth is none other than Brian Grainger of Milieu/Coppice Halifax. Already one for several monikers and projects, Troth is the representation of Brian's experiments with combining drum machines, a mixer and FX devices with acoustic instruments such as thumb piano, acoustic guitar, metal bowls, bells, recorder and harmonica, among other sampled objects and appliances. The result on Combs Hydros is a very playful melodic braindance effort, although the following EP continues to mutate the sound even further. That said, this EP could be seen as the most traditional Troth will ever sound, providing a point of origin for what will likely be a colorful and confusing ride. Issued on a limited edition of 50 copies in soft plastic cases with orange and red decals.",

            "about": "Canvax hails from Enschede, Netherlands, and brings his fresh style of dub, house and electro peppered electronic music to Recycled Plastics with the absolutely essential Condense album. Previously appearing at Body Control and having performed live at Gogbot Festival in 2014, Canvax's music is a glossy minimal techno that seems informed by all sorts of influences, and yet quite unique at the same time. Canvax tracks are sometimes created during a train commute, and the music feels steadily propulsive in the same way, moving at a driving pace through subterranean tunnels and sunny pastoral landscapes.\nThe limited edition CD-R version contains a bonus remix of \"Glide\" by Coppice Halifax as an exclusive track.\nFor the Dutch-speaking among you, check out this neat in-studio interview with the man behind Canvax:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJfUdyF1oVo",
            "credits": "released April 20, 2015\nW/P by Danny Jeroense. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC41, and 41st in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Another year, another Plastic sampler for your tired ears! 2017 was a real mindfuck, if you don't mind us saying. We're at the cooler anyway, so who cares? Can we bum a cig?\nAs is our custom, we have plucked fourteen favorites from last year's releases, which was very painful for us because let's face it, how do you make decisions like this? All of these records are superb and if we did not think so, they wouldn't be here.\nThere's a good bit of feel-good melodic braindance on show here, which probably says a lot about how badly we needed to feel good last year in the first place. If those don't get the endorphins going, then perhaps some of the more 4/4 techno cuts in the middle will. No? Well, thankfully for you we have just the thing at the end of this set: A wind-down of more restrained ambient techno bleep and bloop.\nOkay, looks like my beeper's going off again. Breaktime's over! See you next time - I owe you for that smoke.",

            "about": "2018 came and 2018 went, and then 2019 came, and the RP Corporate Offices sighed a deep and apathetic sigh...and put off the yearly Conference Call until the Winter snow receded and Springtime came bouncing back in with the sunshine. Working from home has never been more appealing.\nThat said, it should not pass by unnoticed that 2018 was host to many solid singles and full-length albums in the Plastix canon! From the thick minimal techno of Lamont Kohner, Algorithm T and Substak, to the hypermelodic braindance of Foamek and Milieu, and even deeper still with dub techno from Brother Blue and Orson Throb. Somewhere between all of it was unique stuff like Demi Odessa's sad bedroom techno pop tracks, Blaubac's modular synthesizer excursions, Bike's Skammy hardware improvisations and Occur's mentalist digital whorls of sound. Recycled Plastics continues its charted path of doing whatever feels good, even when it has already been done.\n2019 already holds many other excellent releases from alumni such as Lamont Kohner, Parallelism, Milieu, Foamek and others...plus new and exciting work by Dusklark, other_Format, Volitune and a few more surprises we don't want to mention yet. Ramble on!",

            "about": "Grey Deer is one Carl Ritger, sonic wizard, dweller of Colorado and perhaps better known as Radere. Constance Dubs is the debut release under his Grey Deer moniker, and fittingly so as it was recorded during the very early days of Carl's musical maturation. Three longform pieces that might surprise Radere fans with their light but propulsive rhythm sections, Constance Dubs is a completely different kind of dub techno album. Steady kickdrums, hi hats and percussive taps are built entirely from field recordings, and the atmosphere around them is a foggy forest of guitars and debris. Very warm, wooden and seemingly wrested from beneath the roots of a mighty oak tree, Constance Dubs is an easily accessible unification of both ambient and techno sensibilities.",
            "credits": "released January 24, 2012\nWritten and produced by Carl Ritger. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC3. Third in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Cybertone's debut self-titled album is a bouncy work of melodic bedroom electronics and tight, funky grooves. These tracks were made lovingly with the cozy classic sounds of an 808 and 303, singing harmoniously together, with an added dose of glossy neon funk and concise software cut-ups. Cybertone is a charming young man named Mike from Ontario and since his debut album is so special and cool, Milieu and Mrs Jynx stepped in and did some remixes for it. Cybertone is completely free, so there's really no reason you shouldn't check this out - a braindance excursion awaits!",
            "credits": "released June 19, 2012\nW/P by Cybertone, except #12: written by Cybertone and remixed/produced by Mrs Jynx, and #13: written by Cybertone and remixed/produced by Milieu. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Bedroom Compost number BC9.",

            "about": "Parallelism, otherwise known as aspect./Sage Taylor and previously known as Textural Being, hails from the Pacific northwest. His debut for Recycled Plastics is the first of several scheduled installments in his own newly-minted subcatalogue, which simply bears the label P. Unlike the ambient house of aspect. or the dub techno of Textural Being (see: BC30 / The Sixth Gap, Textural Being's final release), Taylor's work as Parallelism covers a broader spectrum of ambient and drone music, warm glitch and reduced minimalistic dub. To our ears, this is fresh, vibrant music, truly organic and electronic at the same time, and easily inhabits a world preceded by giants like GAS, Vladislav Delay, Pole and Variant. A feast for the ears and the (closed) eyes, intimate and gentle.\nThe Parallelism subcatalogue will continue with limited edition cassettes, possibly with CD-R punctuations at key points.",
            "credits": "released March 28, 2017\nW/P by Sage Taylor. Mastering and cover design by The Analog Botanist. Photography by Brian Grainger. This is Recycled Plastics number P / / 1, and first in the Parallelism subcatalogue.",

His debut release, DELECTRO, immediately brings to mind the fat analog bounce of Kompakt barnburners, as well as things like Plastikman and Gescom - guaranteed to shake speakers in a club set. Pierre doesn't seem to like super clean mixes, preferring instead analog drumcomputers, synthesizers and tape, and as such DELECTRO fits in at Recycled Plastics as a sort of noisier, nastier counterpart to the Lamont Kohner singles or Ndru's minimal techno masterstroke Knospensprung (see: BC15). And we can indeed say with some authority that Pierre has been a nasty, naughty boy.",
            "credits": "released January 30, 2020\nW/P by Pierre Delecto. Recorded in France, 2019. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Text and design by ABM&D. This is Recycled Plastics number BC83, and 83rd in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Grand Canyon Spring Breaks debuts at RP with the excellent bedroom odyssey Desert Trax. GCSB is a man of many names, we know him as Hugo, but some of you may know him as the mind behind Ravadiscs in France. The hardware-led tangents and tape warmth present on excellent releases like Aqualog and Atlantic Technologies are all present here, with twelve tracks created live using the Ensoniq Mirage eight-bit sampler from 1985, recorded in mono direct to an Akai tape machine with no overdubs (but a good bit of editing to tighten things up in post). Musically, Desert Trax recalls a lot of our favorite moments from labels like Rephlex, Spymania, Clear and Skam - the sort of classic heyday of bedroom electronicists with their machines all sprawled out on a dingy carpet, wires everywhere, plinking and plonking their way through handmade futurism, one sequencer step at a time. It retains all of the rugged and raw elemental aspects of having come from a single live take on only one low-bitrate machine, but to our ears, feels all the more comfortable and authentic for it. Hugo sent music to the RP PO box years earlier, and due to a comedy of errors, where his work went to the wrong address after we relocated, it took a little while to connect...but, we finally aligned our signal paths and are happily able to now bring some of his excellent recordings to your ears. We might be inclined to say \"Better late than never\" if the music didn't sound so timeless and interesting, and Desert Trax is right on time for what our ears need to hear at the end of a long and exhausting year.",

            "about": "Dim Sokette comes to us from an anonymous donor, much in the same way records like Edith Keeler's Harness have. These kinds of releases, where the authorship is left ambiguous, are fascinating because it forces the listener to focus only on what's there in the music. The tracks akrenaut produced bring to mind many fantastic aspects of other music from the past - elements of early Rephlex and Artificial Intelligence-era Warp, the early melodic phases of Ten and Tracer, the somber pads of Fieldtriqp and Christ., the skittering rhythmic programming of early AE, and more, all seem to be referenced here. Whether that's intended, or just a part of the DNA that makes Dim Sokette do what it does, is unknown, and ultimately irrelevant. It feels good - no, great - and it really makes the management here at RP proud to receive records of this caliber in the mailbox, just out of thin air. The only personal touches that seem to be obvious on Dim Sokette are bits of human dialogue that burble in and out of focus on certain tracks, and even a sampled cat meow and purr. akrenaut, whoever they are, are content to ride emotive waves through a very comfortable, homemade environment, and it gives Dim Sokette a nice sense of placement. For every eyebrow-raising chord change or curious bit of processing we hear, there are twice as many moments that feel carefully assembled and completely unique to someone's palette. A lovely release to coincide with Foamek's recent romp in the Autumn leaves, and a solid contribution to the growing RP catalog.",

            "about": "Lamont Kohner is Patrick Benolkin, currently residing in Boise, Idaho, and possibly better known to many of you by the names Electricwest or Eluder. So far, Lamont Kohner has only issued one album - Willamette Dubs, at the ever-loving Wil Ru Records - which our very own Analog Botanist mastered and curated a second disc of remixes for. Lamont has not stayed inactive since that release, rather, he has grown a rather large catalog of unreleased works intended as singles, and what better place to issue them than here at Recycled Plastics? So, with absolutely no hesitation, we set the man up with his own catalog (K, for those still wondering) wherein we will steadily drip out Lamont Kohner's singles, stopping occasionally along the way to collect them into special limited edition CD-R collections with extra tracks. Opening the gates for the new catalog is Dissident, a monochromatic techno rock climber of a track, doing what Lamont Kohner does best, which is slowly filling the room with steam until it's ready to explode, and then deploying state of the art depressurization techniques that masquerade as rusting chord shapes swinging around your center of gravity like a carousel. In short, this is high-pressure music for high fidelity systems, and these tracks will not let you forget this. Be careful, stay safe and enjoy!",
            "credits": "released March 10, 2016\nW/P by Patrick Benolkin. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Cover design by Ginger Aribarn. This is Recycled Plastics number K1. Now stop reading this and fuck off to that play button up there.",

            "about": "Dropper is the second EP released by Occur, issued out of chronological sequence due to the fact that it was recorded and subsequently released in August, 2017 for an emergency charity compilation, to raise money for hurricane and flood victims in Houston TX. Here, it finally sees physical issue, and a place in the OCR catalog proper.\nMusically, Dropper bears some likenesses to Occur recordings that are not yet released - namely Topo (OCR5) and Range (OCR6) - in that it explores the band's more braindance side, with warbling acid lines, warm drum machine bounce and majestic analog synthesizer passages, doused in reverb. Dropper is the kind of recording that might have been found in a pile of lost DATs at Rephlex or Warp in the early to mid-nineties - emotive and spacious, while also remaining very rhythmic and dancefloor appropriate.\nLike all Occur releases, Dropper was improvised live on a mostly analog hardware setup, without overdubs or computers. While this release exists in the Recycled Plastics OCR catalog, the band also maintains their own catalog at  opacitycontrastresolution.bandcamp.com\nAdditionally, an ambient distillation/expansion of Dropper will be released as DOE at sister-label Psoma Psi Phi.",

            "about": "Drum is the debut release by Occur, a collaborative effort between Brian Grainger (Milieu, Coppice Halifax, etc) and John-Paul Kramer (COAL, Casio Commander, etc). This christening work follows a live remixing collaboration on the Coppice Halifax release Okazi [Enkorpigita] (that's Esperanto for Occur [Embodied]), issued as part of CH's Deep Earth series:  malfokusita.bandcamp.com/album/okazi-enkorpigita\nMusically, Occur exists as a proper collaboration should - live, in the moment, unplanned and improvised on a wide array of analog and digital synthesizers, drum machines, outboard FX and laboratory equipment. As such, Occur affairs tend to be tangential and sporadic across long-form runtimes, which are filled with bright prisms of color, dimly lit corners and everything in between. Taking influences from classic works by Aphex Twin, AE/Gescom, Pan Sonic and other early 1990s electronics, as well as more modern trailblazers such as Demdike Stare and Omit, Occur attempts to use both vintage and modern approaches to studio performance in an immediate and impulse-driven way.\nOn Drum, this wide range of styles is funneled into two tracks of rugged, heavy techno that themselves unfurl and melt away into ambient pools of imagined raindrops. Using a DJ turntable with such vinyl sources as African tribesmen, opera music, piano etudes and political lecturers from the 1960s, these sounds are heavily manipulated in realtime and played alongside a studio rig built for dub techno session work by Coppice Halifax (who was using the studio at the time). Indeed, Occur's initial session was something that simply materialized organically on its own, by virtue of both parties being present at that point in space and time. Occur literally just happened.\nAt present, there are already three to four subsequent Occur releases in hand, which are currently being mixed down and mastered. As Occur's artistic philosophy aligns strongly with Recycled Plastics' own mission, it only made sense to create the OCR subcatalog expressly for the band. Physical editions of Drum (and the following OCR releases) are forthcoming, pending materials needed to produce such editions. All physical versions will be exclusively available at Occur's own Bandcamp page here:  opacitycontrastresolution.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "The fifth single in Lamont Kohner's ongoing catalog, \"Dusk Requisite\" offers a more subdued dub techno atmosphere that eventually opens up under the weight of a watertight bass drum. B-side \"Hollow\" recalls the greasy city streets that are never very far away from any LK tracks, with the sounds of a subway rave heard through the pipes and grates on the sidewalk, locomotive rhythms echoing the train tunnels themselves, before stepping aside to plant more resonant chords like seeds in the slick asphalt itself.",

            "about": "As a final sendoff for the 2011 year, the appropriately titled Dusk Versions appears as RP2 at Recycled Plastics. Recorded during the same time as the material for both Outward Residence and Parallel Harbors (at Other Heights, Belgium), but much softer and more catered to night time listening. Quiet, restrained rhythms bounce and sway in the background of a dark sonic ether, fogged by the repetitive layers of smoky chords and short melodic stabs punctuating the groove. Variations and refractions of delays twinkle and bubble like living sparks that decorate corners of the room too dark to see. Minimal notes of bass anchor the tracks with submarine propulsion, and sheets of translucent tape warmth and analog reverb are laid gently over the whole structure. This album is an exercise in finality, in closure. The end of another year, and the last appearance of the oft revisited track Dusk, with the minor exception of a remix album due out in 2012 at Other Heights, featuring Quantec, Grad_U, Ohrwert, Axs, Zzzzra and Textural Being.",

            "about": "Hailing from sunburnt San Diego, waves of sad magic are emanating up like heat off a hot street, and bittersweet blue-skies flow through the eponymous album by DUSKLARK. We haven't done a record like this in some time at RP, and by \"like this\" we mean that very unique, warm and cozy bedroom electronic music that lives inside mid-fi cassette ranges and muted melancholy. Think early Milieu, Freescha's \"Kids Fill The Floor\", Ten and Tracer, pre-breaks Mike P and the textured downsample-crunch of Casino Versus Japan, all bundled up in a breezy lite-house vehicle that makes effective use of electro-tinted drum machines like the 808 and HR16 alongside plainsung sine tone basslines and wobblyheaded melodies bubbling over all corners like citrus Summertime orange soda pop. Introspective music for outdoorsy park walkers, headphone micro-symphonix and smart house grooves that fit into the gloved hand of a drowsy-eyed DJ set in the parking lot of a 24-hour sushi bar. DUSKLARK has arrived, and he'll be taking the sunshine back with him when he goes. Get some before it's all gone...\n**TIP**: The limited edition CD-R is jam-packed with 63 minutes of Dusklark, including 10 (!!!) bonus tracks only included on the disk, one of which is a downer night-bus ride back home - the 9-minute Coppice Halifax BLUE PAYPHONE remix!",

            "about": "Zander One hails from Ohio, and brings Recycled Plastics his lovingly crafted first full-length work Echoate. Echoate is absolutely everything you could want to cuddle up with during the colder months when Autumn transitions into Winter - deep throbs of warm basslines, simple buoyant kickdrums and beautiful synth chords that seem to slowly melt like ice under a gentle orange sun. Reminding us, at times, of what it could be like if Yagya and Seefeel produced a dub techno album together, Zander One goes a step further and defines all of his signature elements minimally and efficiently. Echoate is a work that is presented with zero filler - only carrying with it the essentials needed to work the formula's magic. Anyone who enjoys deep and cozy electronic music will be sorely missing out if they pass this by! One of the best records RP has heard all year by anyone!\nIn addition to the free 8-track album, you can buy a limited edition CD-R with two bonus tracks (Full Moon / Endless Rain) and a Coppice Halifax remix** of Iceberg!\n**Brian had such a good time remixing Iceberg that he actually produced three Coppice Halifax remixes. You can buy all three on the Blue Shape 3\" CD-R EP here:\nstore.milieu-music.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=143\nFor a limited time, the Milieu Music shop has also made a package deal of Echoate & Blue Shape available together for a discounted price here:\nstore.milieu-music.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=69&product_id=145",
            "credits": "released November 12, 2012\nWritten and produced by Zander One. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, November 2012. This is Recycled Plastics number BC12, and twelfth in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Echonine is the aptly titled remix album for 2012's ambient techno odyssey Echoate, although upon closer inspection, it also contains remixes of tracks that weren't actually on Echoate. Echonine is half what you might expect from a Zander One release - distant foggy pads and sublime warm basslines over soft rhythms that aren't in a hurry to get anywhere - and half some other beast entirely, taking notes from Autechre/Gescom on the Entorwellian and Zwei Kreise mixes, and even channeling some warped Dilla-esque hip hop on the QBLA remix. On paper, it seems like it won't work, but listening proves otherwise, and the compilation closes with \"Seaswept\", a beautiful previously unreleased track. Echonine is a colorful and varied collection of tracks that should whet the appetite of listeners eager for a new ZO full-length album. The good news is: one is shortly on the way, due out at the lovely WR label in Portland in the coming months. Until then, enjoy Echonine!",

            "about": "Before filling the RP post office box with happiness, NN* has enjoyed a fruitful career as a mushroom parachute repairman in the distant foreign land of En'entopia, and he's won numerous awards for his magically delicious music. He currently holds the Forestry Division title for most colorful sidewalk chalk art, and he's been elected the Relay Tagmaster three times in a row by the Recycled Pastels Committee. At summer camps, he is always voted Best Chaperone and even after a long day's work monitoring mountain stream temperatures, he still has time to unwind with his synthesizers and watercolors (ladies, take note: he can knob twiddle and portrait paint at the same time!). Thankfully for us at RP, NN* has gifted a true bounty of melodies, overflowing with headnodding oak-tree rhythms, bass stabs played by Jawas and luscious reverbs from Mordor's deepest caverns. As if the album we're giving to you for free isn't amazing enough, there's more - a limited edition CD-R with FOUR bonus NN* tracks and TWO pastoral remixes by MILIEU and MRS JYNX. Zap!",

            "about": "Axs continues his 'Secrets' trilogy of unreleased works from the archives of past years with Evergreen Secrets, an even more groove-oriented set of tracks than Rosewood's subdued technoid forms. Pulsing shapes of dub chords and restrained minimal techno sensibilities allow Axs the space needed to organically explore a colorful landscape of sound, all while buoyant drum machine work and utilitarian bass continually anchor his deep compositions. Gracefully mastered by The Analog Botanist to ensure continuity between recordings that are often years apart, and lovingly represented as a very special addition to the Recycled Plastics catalog. Stay tuned for the third and final volume, Midnight Secrets, in 2014...",
            "credits": "released December 21, 2013\nW/P by Axs. Mastered by The Analog Botanist, November-December 2013 at Botany Bay. This is Recycled Plastics number BC25B, and 25Bth in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "F^vex, the first new recorded effort by Vhom since 2010's guitar drone monument Firmamvnt, is a sprawling set of intense electronics. Taking obvious notes from things like Autechre, Pan Sonic and BRTLMN, with perhaps less-obvious nods to Aube, Omit, Throbbing Gristle and Vladislav Delay, this EP was created using several pieces of incongruous gear in tandem with unique things like reel to reel tape loops, buzzing devices that have been fed too much voltage and broken FX boxes. F^vex is techno music that has been literally broken down and recycled, with tiny bits of recognizable pieces appearing in an otherwise tangled and incomprehensible sonic landscape. Even the track titles allude more to compressed data than to anything resembling language. A perfect piece of bedroom compost for the Bedroom Compost series!\nThere is also an additional ten-minute track on the CD-R version, for those of you who enjoy the feel of a lovingly stickered recycled cardboard square in your hands, especially one that contains a circular readable data disc that is compatible with your home machines!",
            "credits": "released June 20, 2012\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at ### with ### and ### during the summer of ###. This is Recycled Plastics number BC10, and tenth in the Bedroom Compost series.",

Gritty and funky synthetic grooves covered in waves of undulating sonic detritus, with obvious influences from Autechre, Pan Sonic and to a lesser degree, Throbbing Gristle.",

Mutant, sprawling electronics built using the DJ-tool album Halifaxian (by Coppice Halifax) in conjunction with analog and digital processing, equipment and software. Gritty and funky synthetic grooves covered in waves of undulating sonic detritus, with obvious influences from Autechre, Pan Sonic and to a lesser degree, Throbbing Gristle.",

            "about": "Flax Harmonade is a collaborative project between Brian Grainger and Lee Batchelor, themselves better known as Milieu and Scup Bucket. This album was their first and only release, recorded between 2004 and 2006, and released on a limited edition CD-R at U-Cover in Belgium in Autumn of 2006. Influenced by all manner of playful braindance and classic bedroom electronic music such as early Aphex, Global Goon, Ovuca, the Mike & Rich album and Cylob, among many others, Flax Harmonade is closer to the acidy melodic dance music of Milieu's Polypsilon or Academy Stripes, and was fairly out of character with his audience in 2006. As such, the FH album went somewhat under the radar of many fans, and even now we're betting that many of you have never even heard of it. So, retrieved from the dusty vaults, a weird, funky, catchy and exciting album is once again available via Recycled Plastics. Enjoy!",

            "about": "Privately commissioned in 2013, Fugue State Phases has collected digital dust for four years now. Recording sessions began with the express intent to return to the 'classic' Milieu sound, circa 2005-2006, following the example of albums like Slow Lid Close and Our Blue Rainbow. To do this, I went to great lengths in order to use the exact same setups and FX that I used back then, and worked for several months to attempt to get back to that very specific headspace, compositionally. I'm not absolutely certain that I succeeded in my charge, but considering how much material I create, even the distance of a year is like centuries apart, in terms of forward movement in my work. In any case, the results are quite melodic, funky and a little bent in that very specific detuned way all of the earlier Milieu music was. The astute listener will recognize certain drum breaks, bass, organ and synthesizer sounds and other ephemera that appeared all over the earlier Milieu output. A possible past, perhaps from a different Brian Grainger in a different timeline - where instead of Slow Lid Close, this might have existed in its place.\nToday, I'm releasing this publicly to aid Bandcamp's charity drive for the Transgender Law Center, on August 4, wherein they will donate 100% of their share. Some of my biggest musical influences are transgender or gender-queer artists, and their equal rights, happiness and well-being mean a lot to me. So buy a record, get some music, help me and help others in need - everybody wins.\ndaily.bandcamp.com/2017/07/31/this-friday-stand-with-bandcamp-in-support-of-trans-rights/\n**Editor's note: All track titles for this album were conceived by the person who commissioned the work. I do not know the people they name or the situations they reference. In this way, the work maintains a personal connection to the curator, while simultaneously being a public work for everyone to draw their own conclusions with.",

            "about": "Mustatunturi is a mysterious artist who hails from Russia, and has been producing music for a very long time - this is nearly all we know. He informed us of his being inspired by living in the Far North, snow, ice and the polar lights of the Rybachy Peninsula, from which the title of this work is derived. Sometimes, however, as many other RP releases have proven, knowing less about the artist and their intentions only serves to place the focus completely on the music. So, on BC58, what do we hear?\nDeep, dimly lit soundfields that seem to recall minimal electronic works from Robert Hood, Plastikman and certain Chain Reaction wax. Driving grooves anchor a glistening, lonely city filled with silhouettes of industrial structures and streetlamps that only seem to illuminate the lazily falling slanted rain and detritus. There is a cold distance at play here, between artist and listener - a deliberate wall, beyond which sits a void that longs for human touch but never quite knows how to accomplish it.\nMany elements of Giehkirnjarga are classic drum machine and synthesizer sounds from all eras of techno records, and in this way, the album feels as if it is not quite modern, but a recently unearthed archival recording from twenty years ago. A perfect passenger for night drives and oily neon sign-lit bar windows, leather seats and voyeuristic Polaroids...longing and self-imposed exile.",
            "credits": "released August 29, 2017\nW/P by Mustatunturi. Mastering by Mustatunturi. This album is dedicated to the Saami people of northern Finland, Russia and Norway. This is Recycled Plastics number BC58, and 58th in the ongoing Bedroom Compost catalog.",

            "about": "After his wildly well-received Royal Secret single, Tim Gray brings us the first full-length album as Brother Blue: Green Cloud. Melodic stabs, hazy pads and rumbling bass are the order of the day with Green Cloud. Faithful to the staples of the dub techno sound, but not afraid to get a bit textural and gritty as well. Rough in all the right spots, yet still soft enough to invite you in, Green Cloud is a superb near-80 minute jaunt through Tim's stylish production approach. A rich techno record just in time for the humidity of Spring!\nThe limited edition CD-R comes with two exclusive bonus tracks: \"Fireface\" and \"Endtimes\"",

            "about": "As if in a lucid dream, or an echo of some previous life, you open a door to a small house in a quiet urban neighborhood. A single streetlamp draws a lazy line across your back as you enter the home, and you seem to float through the entryway, bodiless. Your camera eye weaves slowly through the empty livingroom, casually scanning cheap furniture, a VCR from the 1980s and an answering machine with an ominous, blinking red light. You glide silently into a hallway, and veer slightly right to arrive in a dim bedroom. A saggy mattress slumps onto a black metal frame, covered in mussed red sheets, and flanked on both sides by small wooden end tables. On one, you see a digital clock with the time blinking an incessant 3:33. On the other, a weathered copy of a paperback next to an ashtray. Your gaze narrows to read the title - \"Die Schlafende Erde\", with a photograph of an empty rural road on the cover. Just then, a small sound, and the faint movement of curtains in the corner. A window is open, and a small breeze blows into the room like a whispered secret, bringing with it the incense of a hot summer night, baked on cricket legs and cicada shells. You get the urge to reach your arms out, and down, perhaps to put your hand to your chest in pensive consideration, but nothing happens. A second sense of voyeuristic powerlessness washes over you, and from the darkened passage behind you, a door opens.",

            "about": "One of the most interesting demos to arrive in the Recycled Plastics post office box is this 47 minute romp through bouncy techno and Rephlexian electronics from one Edith Keeler - no return address, no additional information beyond a typewritten message asking RP to release it, and for any money made with the album to help furnish future RP releases. As it happens, Harness hits all the right spots for something in the RP catalog - massive club-friendly basslines and kicks, wobbly melodies, space cadet pads and swirling hi-hats with lots of technical edits everywhere. We have no idea what kind of hardware or software was employed to make these tracks, and frankly, we don't care. When the music is this satisfying, it could be coming out of a kazoo and we'd never blink an eye. Perhaps this is what Edith Keeler (whoever she or he really is) is trying to accomplish with this album - a focus on the music alone, with zero pretext and nothing else to prop it up besides what comes out of the speakers. Either way, we hope Edith continues to ping our PO box in the future.",

            "about": "Bovaflux is a talented young man named Eddie from the United Kingdom. By day, Eddie works on video games (such as this year's excellent Elite: Dangerous) and by night (and also probably by day too, now that we think about it) he coaxes lovely warm melodies and bleepy drumlines from his studio. Reminding us of things like early Bochum Welt, Artificial Intelligence and the more optimistic sounding records in the Toytronic catalog, Hermetic Peaks is a colourful and varied stroll through many of the best things about electronic music from the last ten years, carefully and considerably placed on display like statues in a garden or paintings in a hall, each burbling with sonic character and synthesized funk that just won't quit. Bovaflux is a welcome addition to the growing Recycled Plastics family, with a perfect record for keeping cool in the summer sun.\nThere is a limited edition CD-R version of BC42, which includes two bonus tracks and a special Milieu remix!",
            "credits": "released July 22, 2015\nW/P by Eddie Symons. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC42, and 42nd in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "It seems that Shallow Earth's shadow extends further than I might have expected, because this is a new stash of trax that sort of embody the palette of RP11, albeit with a bit more of a house music and occasionally acidic bend. Somewhere between a long EP and a short album, Housewares consists of eight cuts of Milieu dance music in varying degrees of ADHD, sometimes content to cruise with the windows down and others, ready to burst through the nightclub wall with a bass assault. Influences should be somewhat obvious - AFX, Norken, Underworld, DJ Sprinkles, cv313, Cylob, Russ Gabriel, Magic Arrows, among lots of other stuff. Housewares is for the late night feel good and the early morning feel bad...or is it the other way around? I can barely keep the days of the week straight here in my basement, so these jams may be a little frayed around the edges, but they mean well. Hugs and high fives.",

Produced in the older style of Coppice Halifax records, with full compressor abuse to the point of textural overload, and inspired in equal parts by drone-techno fellows Submersion and Mon0, and the transmutation of the cold itself into sonic tapestry.\nThe limited edition CD-R version contains the bonus 40+ minute piece \"Ice Forest [Melted]\", to warm your insides back up after traversing the immense and formidable Ice Forest.",

            "about": "Substak returns to Recycled Plastics for his third release in our Bedroom Compost series - a feat only held by two other artists currently (Zander One and Axs) - although INDEX is sure to be anything but Substak's final word on our imprint.\nHaving traversed abstract rhythmic pulses on Beatless, and low-frequency submersible exploration on No Sense, Index sees Substak at perhaps his most straightforward at RP, employing minimal techno propulsion that recalls things like Reinhard Voigt's Pentax alias at Profan, Basic Channel and some of the weirder things at Rephlex. While rhythm is the focus of Index, Substak uses it almost melodically, presenting sections of drum programming that are tangled up in knots, as other tracks feel as if they are physical vessels that Substak is slowly filling with pitch-altering chemicals. Aspects of Index can be found in other Substak records, but (as usual for his work) this release feels like a microscoping zooming-in of a small curve or shadow on a much larger universe of sound. More like a study of a singular object, rather than a summation of multiple ideas. Substak's sound is in constant motion, and yet feels incredibly focused and deliberate - careful, even - across tracks whose modest runtimes trick the ears into blissful massage and hypnosis, giving the impression of exceptionally longer pieces.\n**Dedicated listeners would be wise to pick up the limited edition CD-R of Index, which includes two additional Substak cuts (Index 1.7 & 1.8) that introduce acid lines over the percussive establishment of the first six Index tracks, as well as a Coppice Halifax remix of Index 1.6 that reshapes the source material into a mid-fi dancefloor monster.",

            "about": "RP alumni Zander One returns with his third release for us, Inner Horizon. The official follow up album to 2012's amazing Echoate, Inner Horizon presents both familiar sounds and fresher approaches to the luscious Zander One template. Cozy melancholic pads overlap a womblike (and occasionally funky) rhythm section, while the humming warmth of the basslines and the distant reverb-coated lead lines carry you through Zander One's deep movements. Inner Horizon is a perfect accompaniment to the Autumn season, and a lush addition to the RP catalog. This is listening techno at its finest!\nThe limited edition CD-R contains two bonus remixes - Zwei Kreise's Autechre-influenced take on Vapor Trail, and Coppice Halifax's 18 minute 'Frosty Field' version of Isolation.",
            "credits": "released November 26, 2014\nW/P by Joe Maas. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, Autumn 2014. This is Recycled Plastics number BC32, and 32nd in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Media Them finally returns to RP, after the silent success of An Expensive Vase and Logical Love, with Inside The Lines. Continuing down the path of the undeniable and unique Media Them sound, approaching a mental centerpoint via repetition, loops used as medicine, sound applied shamanistically, audio editing as alchemy. An addressing of just what one would like to say when they sit down to create anything at all. Inside The Lines operates a bit more playfully and melodically than the previous two MT releases, although it too begins to gravitate toward pure warm emptiness and isolationism at certain points. As we wrote before about Media Them, these are not songs, so much as windows, which each provide a macrocosmic view of something basic, calming, yet curious. With Media Them, we are able to assume the viewpoint of the creator perfectly. We see what he sees, we hear as he hears. This is a process of musical and atmospheric elimination, and each window can be repeated infinitely until you feel you're able to move forward.",

            "about": "After years of planning, compiling and remastering, Recycled Plastics is beaming with pride to present JYNX'S GARDEN, a twenty-five track retrospective of music by the inimitable MRS JYNX. Containing almost completely unreleased works, going back to as early as 2004, this collection has been lovingly tidied up and sequenced by The Analog Botanist, emphasizing depth and contour for maximum aural contentment.\nMusically, Mrs Jynx's work is (perhaps topically described as) the sonic equivalent of those old Lisa Frank binders girls carried to school in the 1980's - bursting with every color you can imagine, psychedelic candy for the senses. Beneath the bright sunrays and endless blue skies, however, are some truly formidable compositional and sound-design talents. Jynx's music is inherently melodic, but there's never a dull moment in her bouncing drum machine rhythms or tight, funky basslines either. You also won't find a musician beholden to using the sounds of \"classic\" drum machines and synthesizers - rather, Mrs Jynx makes these machines do what she wants them to do, and say what she wants them to say.\nMany of these tracks have stayed with me since I first met Hannah sometime in 2006, and I've taken them everywhere - when I performed in Germany and raved about her work to people there, and whenever I found a spot for a remix on a Milieu album (or something here at RP), I'd be able to count on her to contribute only the very best work. I was ecstatic when I found out she'd been picked up by Mike Paradinas for releasing at his Planet Mu imprint, and yet - I was always amazed that these songs didn't make the cut on either of her fantastic albums there (2008's The Standoffish Cat and 2010's Shark Carousel). So, the act of assembling such a stellar compilation of my favorite Mrs Jynx music and being able to facilitate its release at my own label, is nothing short of a career highlight for me.\nI'm certain that this music will bring wide smiles and tickled eardrums to people all over the world, which is exactly what the world could use more of: Happiness. Indeed, that is perhaps the best way to sum up Hannah's sublime creations - Mrs Jynx is happiness, and all you need to do is press play.\n**Extra special thanks to Nicholas Knudson, who created the original painting you see on the cover especially for this album, and to Eric Adrian Lee, who assembled the whole package into the eye-popping item you see for sale before you.",

            "about": "Mustatunturi returns to RP with the futurist-technoid KAAMOS (that's Finnish for \"Polar Night\"), a set of 10 tracks (the final three are disc-exclusives) that continue his explorations of sparse atmospheres anchored with classic techno and electro sensibilities. Lots of satisfying bleeps/bloops (or bleebs as Vainio may have called them) intertwined with a very \"traditionalist\" drum machine palette, bearing a bit more grittiness than the rhythms on the previous record, and many voices of synthesized bass, chords and leads that would not be out of place on a Polygon Window or Astrobotnia album. The whole of it comes together in an evocative way that both recalls pioneering works by RDJ, Atkins, Mills and of course the late Ø (although that last one could just be colored perception because of the Finnish connection - we do think it's a bit deeper than that...perhaps something in the air or water in Finland?) but it also feels fresh and renewed, despite using tools and sounds that are immediately somewhat familiar. Topically, Kaamos has more in common with the Lamont Kohner singles we've released, or some aspects of the Zwei Kreise and Screener36 releases, sure to delight listeners and pull them further into the future as we might yet know it.",

            "about": "Ndru, a German minimalist named Andre, who is also known elsewhere for his experimental works produced under the name Bored Man Ganesh, as well as helming the Organic Industries imprint, makes a stately and vibrant debut at Recycled Plastics with Knospensprung. Comprised of tracks produced in past and recent years, Knospensprung is a multifaceted set of techno assemblages that pop and fizz with playful gaiety, and this album can be seen as the first of more to be issued at our humble label. Andre has been making music for years, and his works have graced clubs and vinyl and bedrooms and headsets all over the world as his sound grows and expands. We've been in love with his music in both the rhythmic and beatless capacities for a long time and it is nothing short of a massive honor that we're able to bring you Knospensprung. For those of you who would like to purchase BC15, we've added two delectable remixes by Lamont Kohner and Coppice Halifax, both of whom have been remixed by Ndru in the past, as CDr exclusives.",

            "about": "Screener36 is a talented man named Victor, who resides in France and makes blippy squeaky trax that tickle our lobes and move our feet too. Spacious, funky, clean - Screener36's debut for RP brings to mind lots of lovely things, like Amber-era AE, CiM, Bochum Welt and even a little early Metamatics. Whatever your preference, you're sure to enjoy the catchy melodies, warm basslines and positively lush pads. A nice apertif for summer nights, supported by a very special Coppice Halifax remix and three more bonus trax on the CD-R!",

            "about": "For our 10th main catalog release, Recycled Plastics is happy to offer up a double-disc set of bedroom compost from the sun-baked mind of Milieu. 2+ hours of live braindance, compiled from a sweat-drenched club performance and a few studio rehearsals orbiting it. Bouncy, colorful and warm, and coaxed out of a computer-free rig of analog synthesizers, samplers, drum machines and FX. For fans of the hardware excursions on Bismuth Cosmolog, the melodic-overload of albums like Academy Stripes or the longform bliss-outs on the Eufloria soundtrack, the Lenticular Carpet Surfboard has room for just about everyone!",
            "credits": "released March 20, 2019\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Performed live on various dates with the following hardware: Korg Minilogue / Monologue / Volca Kick / Volca Sample / Volca Keys / Volca Bass / Volca Beats, Boss DR-202 / DR-660, Arturia Microbrute, channeled through a Peavey FX2 24-channel mixer and a Mackie ProFX8 8-channel mixer, with FX including a Pioneer SR202W spring reverb box, Boss RV-3 digital reverb, BBE Two Timer analog delay, Alesis Quadraverb, Ibanez DS-5 digital delay and custom DSP patches onboard the FX2 and ProFX8. Text and design by ABM&D. Mastering by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number RP10.\nThanks to all the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club at Patreon!

            "about": "For the final installment of the Bedroom Compost series before we enter a new year, we bring you Arbee's seductive Libre Arbitre album. Virtually bubbling over with wild sprawls of organic electronics, Libre Arbitre delivers a warm, cuddly listening experience that is perfect for Winter. Arbee's standalone style of growing alien forms from familiar electronic pastures is once again at the forefront of these songs - at any moment, a track can twist itself from a still ambient pool of dripping notes into a clattering drunken rhythmic structure, and back again. Arbee's work is not incidentally this way, but his is a decided compositional process that leaves in all the aural hiccups and analog atmosphere.\nArbee's original concept for Libre Arbitre was for the album to include eight original tracks, and have them mirrored by eight remixes. So, the eight originals remain here for free, and the eight remixes are included on the CD-R version of Libre Arbitre. The remix personnel are: Fingers In The Noise, Bleupulp, Darren Harper, Stopmotion, Galerie Stratique, Jonas The Plugexpert, E1000 and Coppice Halifax.\nYou can stream all eight remixes here:  soundcloud.com/recycledplastics/sets/bc13-remixes",
            "credits": "released December 17, 2012\nW/P by Arbee. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC13, and thirteenth in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "AQ Acid Crew debuts at Recycled Plastics with the evocative Live Cuts Vol. 1. AQ is a talented young man named Erik who has a lovely way with his machines, coaxing the most organic movements and the warmest body language from acid lines and propulsive drums. Live Cuts 1, as you might imagine, is the first in a series of releases, all recorded completely live while AQ explores sonic dimensions beyond our own. At times sounding like the most authentic traditionalist acid, and at others, exercising minimal techno muscle, Live Cuts are stream of consciousness electronic music that works well in the club or the bedroom. Keep your eyes open for more installments of the AQ catalog, and be sure to pick up a copy of the limited edition CD-R, complete with bonus cuts to maximize your listening pleasure.",
            "credits": "released September 22, 2013\nW/P by AQ Acid Crew. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, September 2013. This is Recycled Plastics number AQ1.",

            "about": "AQ Acid Crew's second edition of Live Cuts continues his work studying the organic variance and inherent alien qualities of pure, unadulterated acid music. Venturing deep into a remote sonically heightened mindstate, AQ once again delivers some of the most engaging acid and techno we've ever had the pleasure of releasing at RP. Massive structures emerge from the hypnotic patterns AQ weaves so effortlessly - megaliths of oscillating waveforms, feedback that could be a groaning extraterrestrial tongue and browbeating drum programming that keeps you on the edge of your seat. Fans of AQ's work would be well advised to pick up the limited edition CD-R, which contains four additional mind-melting tracks, bringing the runtime close to a full 80 minutes!",
            "credits": "released December 20, 2013\nW/P by AQ Acid Crew. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, November-December 2013. This is Recycled Plastics number AQ2.",

            "about": "Oxynucid is a man who has seen many summers and winters pass from the vantage point of a magical cave, nestled deep within the English woods. Having issued his libations at labels such as The Centrifuge, Complex Sound Sagacity and Body Control, his first of two slated jaunts at Recycled Plastics is this smoldering meteorite, Live In The Front Room. Featuring (you guessed it) live trax performed using a handful of analog hardware, in the heat of the moment, with barely a care placed on the production and handling of such a molten white blast of ethereal energy. Thankfully, The Analog Botanist was waiting outside the cave, alchemical herbs and reagents at the ready, willing and able to provide a comfortable home for these five primordial speaker eaters. Rough, burly and as heavy as a sleeping bear, Front Room is a workout for all of your techno muscles - yes, you, the one holding the controller. Musician! Take up thy synthesizer and walk!\nAs a verrah special bonus, Coppice Halifax was coaxed out of his own deep ravine in the Far Hills, to concoct an 11-minute psychedelic dub techno trip from the burnt ashes of #1-5 that Oxynucid left behind in his divine furor. CD-R only! You know what to do!",

            "about": "Logical Love is the second album by Media Them at Recycled Plastics, released as part of our new MT catalog line. As the title of the opening track \"Feeling Warm Inside\" would indicate, this is an incredibly warm listen that surrounds you with pleasant ambience. A gentle throb of bass in the dreamy fog of swirling loops that repeat forever. Just enough hint of a melody or a rhythm to trick your brain into thinking you're listening to a developing piece of music, and not a loop, and by the time you realize the repetition, your ship has already sunk. Those of you who picked up An Expensive Vase will note the appearance of the track \"Finally Forgotten\" on this album as well. The answer for that is that there is no answer. Media Them creates art and we simply experience it.",

            "about": "For the third and final installment of his Secrets series, Axs gives RP Midnight Secrets. Perhaps alluding to the feeling one gets after being awake for far too long, Midnight Secrets is probably the weirdest and most experimental of the three volumes (and admittedly Axs' favorite as well). Where Rosewood established the roots of the Axs canon, and Evergreen painted vivid landscapes with that exposition, Midnight succeeds in pulling the Axs sound further forward, with obtuse synth gardens like 'Nightshade' (a track that could easily fit into the stark sound-art of Raster-Noton or even some of Mika Vainio's records) and the house-inflected piano and upright bass dub of 'Shift Anomaly' (which recalls producers like Terre Thaemlitz and Jeff Mills). 'Swamp Politics' features a wobbly squarewave lead and aching pad that sort of reminds us of a dubbier version of Autechre's Amber era, and 'Static Space' feels loose and shaky, as if the foundations of the rhythm itself are pulling apart as the track moves forward. Closing with the bright and spacious 'Endloop', Axs seems to say that even after three extensive archive releases, he still has a lot of sonic exploration to do. Sharing secrets has never felt so good, and we're already looking forward to the next aural excursion that awaits our ears from Axs.\nAdditionally, this volume (like the previous two) contains two CD-R-only bonus tracks: [Restored Picture E] and [Restored Picture CH], which is a special Coppice Halifax remix drafted specifically for the Secrets series!",

            "about": "When Coppice Halifax was first established as a peripheral project of Milieu in 2006, I never would've thought that the two different concepts would connect and overlap in the ways that they have since then. Albums like High Hawaiian Fog, Bedroom Carpet and now this one - they have all walked a very thin line between the CH sound and the Milieu sound. Milkwhite is in some ways a Halifaxian answer to a Milieu album like H Is For Hologram - all the same elements are present: classic drum machines, analog tape recording and an emphasis on a kind of \"pure\" bedroom electronic music. Where Hologram is more science-fiction, Milkwhite is fantasy, if that analogy makes any sense at all. I began work on this album years ago (sometime in 2010 I think) as nothing more than music for me to play at night while I passed out in bed reading a paperback. Hopefully, that aesthetic of intimate home-space music is still present in the final tracks (which themselves have been retooled and tightened up in spots, as reflected on the precursor release Sno Dreem). In short, Milkwhite is a playful set of feel-good bedroom braindance, sure to please appreciators of both the Milieu and Coppice Halifax varieties.\n-Brian Grainger",

            "about": "Procedural Braindance returns with MISTRAL, a 20+ track sophomore effort that not only reiterates just how robust a generative music system can be, but ventures into colorful new ground with the format. Generally speaking, Mistral focuses a bit more on faster tempos and Tuss/Syro-esque spazzouts, replete with swollen chorus-glossed chords, roundly inflated basslines and many classic drum machine sounds in hyperactive mode. There's a little bit more of a bite to the tracks here than on Pentachroma, bringing to mind some of the cuts from Proc. Braindance's alter-ego, Face Culler. Still, for the sequencing geeks and their ilk, there're more than enough pretty melodies and pad sweeps to keep you stargazing the whole time. An absolute wonderland of synthesis and an even greater accomplishment considering the very real fact that this is 100% generative, music made and played by a program that Procedural Braindance coded and created from the ground up. We here at RP are always stunned enough at the quality on offer from this producer and his system that it becomes criminally easy to get comfortable about it. Don't sleep!\nAs with Pentachroma, Mistral's limited edition CD-R iteration comes with several bonus tracks exclusive to the format. Also included as digital bonuses are a video illustrating one of the PB software patches in action, and also a text document providing greater detail on the source of this generative system.",

            "about": "A field of wheat sways in the breeze, somewhere in England. In the distance, you can just hear a stream burbling over soft rocks, mingling in and out of occasional birdsong. Sun dapples across the field and the forest onset that sits beyond it, a dark green curtain filled with mysterious incense and Earth. It's a pleasantly warm Summer day, and just as you begin to relax, your eye catches sight of an unlikely sitting chair inside the thicket. You walk toward it, curious, to find as the wheat stalks part that it is next to an old wooden record player, outfitted with bronzed detailing and a reasonably large burnt orange speaker. It doesn't appear to be plugged in, and yet, you already know it will work. At that perfect moment, you notice on the ground next to the chair a 12x12\" dark green box with a cream-white bakelite handle, its color matching the deep woods behind the field perfectly. Opening the container carefully, you find five shellac discs adorned with black and gold center labels, showing floral patterns in an art nouveau style. No text, besides the initials D.O.M., seemingly engraved into the discs themselves. You tenderly place the first one onto the mystical turntable, and lower the metal arm to its etched destination. A sublime chord blooms out of the orange speaker, and seems to nudge you softly down into the chair. Like a drug, the ambience washes over you, timestretching the birdsong and flanging the sunbeams themselves. From here, you can't remember much more - just a fleeting feeling of familiarity, like a place you visited as a child and barely remember. Suddenly aware of yourself again, you finish reading the description of Oxynucid's newest album on Bandcamp, and think to yourself: \"Did I already press play? Have I been here before?\" Intrigued, you dare to press the play button (again?), just to find out...",

            "about": "Joining RP's expanding roster is Andre Zufall, better known to many of you as Mon0. Having released several excellent albums on Kreislauf, Test Tube, Silent Season and Sublime Porte, he has spent quite some time refining his own special brand of deep ambient drones and rhythmic pulsing techno. Monophon is possibly Recycled Plastics' deepest release yet, in terms of complete disconnected minimalist techno - longform tracks filled with dark passages of drones and rumbling low end, which eventually give way to womblike rhythms and organic percussive elements that build up like a storm cloud. Mon0 is a master of hypnotizing you with frequency alone, before gradually lifting up the curtain and revealing the alien machinery he's built to receive and capture the raw slow breath of the cosmos.\nIncluded on the limited edition CD-R version is an additional 9 minute track (Instability) plus three mutant remix works by Zzzzra, Zwei Kreise and Coppice Halifax. A full eighty minute sonic odyssey awaits you!",
            "credits": "released November 10, 2014\nWritten and produced by Andre Zufall. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, Summer 2014. This is Recycled Plastics number BC36, and 36th in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Lamont Kohner once again graces our catalog with NIGHTLY, another two-track single of oil-slicked techno chug and abandoned factory-floor bass. Backed with CHROMATOSE, these two cuts once again assert that Kohner has the hands of an old master, dominating a dancefloor while remaining just elusive enough to continually reveal hidden peaks and valleys inside the wash of low end and nightlife neon. NIGHTLY recalls a bit of Rhythm & Sound / Main Street classic dub thump before getting impatient and riding some cymbal over a slo-mo house kick and clap. CHROMATOSE spaces out the space even more, with a distant woodblock that could just as easily be heard through a wet drain coming up from a standpipe, and chords doubling the claps that remind us a little of classic Kompakt schaffel and Speicher barnburners. Just a drop on the tongue, you wouldn't dare take any more of this into your system!",

            "about": "Following his retro-futuristic dub techno album Terrain Scan, Specta Ciera (known elsewhere as Devroka and half of Drexon Field) returns to Recycled Plastics with a new twelve-tracker, Nitelight, packed full of rubbery synth basslines, funky electro rhythms and rainbow-chroma hooks, virtually tumbling out of the speakers like a giftbox full of melodies. This new album invokes/evokes a whole lot of interesting cornerstones from the last fifty years of electronic music - shades of Kraftwerk, Juan Atkins and Drexciya rub shoulders with chiptune bubbles that come spraying out of a champagne bottle at a Jan Hammer boat party in Miami...wriggling monosynth lines squirm and splash in the bright blue seawater, which washes up on the shores of Clear-era Metamatics 12\"s and Shibuya-kei neon coastlines dotted with Cornelius clubs and YMO arcades. Truly, these tracks recall other RP catalog moments like Sint's Zonmist, 101's (Para)Normal Life and both Cybertron releases, as well as the starry-eyed pop compositions of Mrs Jynx, NN* and Foamek, arriving right on time for the cool and invigorating nights that creep in with the Autumn, just when you thought Summer burnout had you bummed.",

            "about": "Substak returns from Greece with his second album for Recycled Plastics - NO SENSE. Following 2015's beautifully isolated BEATLESS album, No Sense offers up another side of the Substak sound. Where Beatless employed gratuitous sub-bass and sculpted pulses out of the lower end of the frequency spectrum, No Sense feels a bit lighter, airier and more cleanly produced. Substak's trademark elements of rhythmic presence, with or without drums, as well as his fascination with deep blue atmospheric loops are still present, slightly augmented by distant percussive sounds or gritty textural sections that rise out of filter passes like giant waves. No Sense reveals Substak's ability to compose with reverb and filtering as his primary instruments, shaping the sound in subtle ways and giving the listener a feeling of experiencing these aural events from different perspectives. Things feel almost like planetary bodies moving closer and further apart all at once, with the recordings documenting momentary alignments and harmonies. All of this may sound tense and slightly foreboding on paper, but Substak has a way of taking alien sonics and conveying them through native tongues - mutation into transmutation. No Sense is a total head trip that feels far longer than its 45 minute runtime, proving that depth and gravity can be achieved in other ways beyond length, with Substak serving as a master of dimension.\nIf you enjoy No Sense, definitely pick up a copy of the limited edition CD-R, which contains a gorgeous 13 minute bonus track to close the record.",

            "about": "Dérive Dub is a new moniker for Dimitar Dodovski, elsewhere known for his varied works at labels such as Databloem and Shimmering Moods, or for his Moss Garden collaboration with Lee Norris of Metamatics and Norken. Despite all of these prior iterations, Dérive Dub feels entirely fresh and vibrant, an atmosphere of its own.\nTopically, it reminds us of playful analog meanderings from Pub, Chain Reaction, Russ Gabriel and of course the ubiquitous early Warp and Rephlex catalogs. Beyond those mentions, however, it dives a bit deeper and connects to more Detroit and Berlin grades of techno and ambient music, which would appeal to fans of the dub techno and braindance sides of the RP catalog.\nA perfect playmate with the new Brother Blue EP, Notte Variations offers five excursions for intimate nighttime drives, bedroom rest (or recreation) and of course the dancefloor. Listeners who support the limited edition CD-R version of Notte Variations will be rewarded with a disc-exclusive Coppice Halifax remix of Notte 3!",

            "about": "Following the spastic ER-1 showcase that was the VLISS EP, Bike has once again returned to RP with two lengthy tracks of live hardware improvisation: OCCLIPSE. Produced using a Boss DR-660 drum machine in tandem with four Korg Volca machines, a Roland SH-32 polysynth and the enigmatic Grass C-TCM medical unit, OCCLIPSE is full to the brim with ring modulated rust and sub-bass gristle. Still, perhaps uncharacteristically for Bike, it also contains strains of melodic melancholy, however distant and bent they may be, that recall Brian's influences from Loess, Musik Aus Strom and Arovane's early DIN 12\"s, among the usual hallmarks from things like late nineties Autechre and Gescom material.\nOCCLIPSE is also the first release in the Bedroom Compost catalog to be made available for sale digitally, instead of name-your-price. With rising costs of operation, shipping hikes and all manner of other expenses associated with maintaining an ever-growing pulsating brain of electronic music, we at RP feel it is a small change that should be rather inconsequential to most of our listeners, and will allow the label a bit more assurances in staying open, through dry seasons and financial hardship alike. From this moment forward, all digital releases in the Bedroom Compost series have gone from $0.00 to $1.11. We thank you for your support, kindness and understanding.\nFor supporters of the physical format: OCCLIPSE may or may not include unlisted remixes as bonus tracks, produced by unnamed parties.",

            "about": "For the second entry in the Bedroom Compost series, The Jaffa Kid turns in some of the freshest bedroom braindance you'll hear in 2011! Leading off his album with a sharp new version of a track previously released on the superb Wrangled Mangled album (see: Expanding Electronic Diversity circa 2007) and maintaining a high level of quality melodic electronic music with a heavy dose of analog warmth. Though not too many people know The Jaffa Kid, he's produced enough quality braindance to be considered braindance royalty, according to us. Recommended if you like oldschool playful RDJ, Ovuca or the Vibert/Simmonds records. Grab it!",
            "credits": "released December 18, 2011\nW/P The Jaffa Kid. Gently mastered/sequenced by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC2, and second in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Right on time for the turning of the leaves and the smoky Autumn air wafting through purple skies, is Foamek. He's been working on this full-length album for years, and boy does it show. With feet planted in braindance, trance and clubby techno camps, there's a unique sound palette on display here that never feels forced or unnatural - rather, we're able to enjoy sounds as they breathe and bump into each other across solid rhythmic currents, and one can easily observe Foamek being in complete command of his abilities, plucking melodies from the tape-hiss soaked/smoked air and filling up his drums with thick bass like they're gallon jugs.\nOn Doing/Being Ordinary seems to be a very personal statement from Foamek, one we're admittedly not too used to receiving and releasing at RP, where artistic escapism is the lay of the land. There are moments of bittersweetness, as on the title track and (the gorgeous curtain call) Avalon, as well as deeper passages of highway-driving introspection, like In Transit or Fever Dream. Further still are moments of blissful, beaming happiness, like Little Maine Coon and Age, connecting to elements of Foamek in full-on party mode (just TRY listening to Backyard Rave without moving your feet). When I first found Foamek's music in 2007, and we embarked upon four different split releases together, his work was just as playful and melodically accessible. Since then, however, it feels as if it has truly aged along with him, and Doing/Being stands as an expressive document of a person who has taken all of these things with them. These ideas feel very lived-in and comfortable, even when they are sad, and perhaps that's what Foamek is positing in his title statement: A little bit of comfort can go a long, long way.\nFor the heads: Grab one of the limited edition CD-Rs, as they contain three bonus tracks not present on the digital release!",

            "about": "101, perhaps more well known by his dub techno alias Giriu Dvasios, has been a quiet but potent source of solidly crafted braindance in the last few years. Having released three previous 101 albums (they're all fantastic) at his own Cold Tear imprint across the sea, RP gave him the secret handshake that allowed us to import this fantastic hardware funk jam to you dear people. What follows is a tightly produced record filled with many of the classic staples of the bedroom techno scene - vintage drum machines, acid lines with added squelch, firm basslines ready for your bins. Nothing unexpected, but that's exactly what's to be expected here at RP. Of course, the most defining element of 101's work is his ear for melody, and you'll find plenty here!\nThe limited edition CD-R version comes with two bonus tracks!",

            "about": "Procedural Braindance is a new project from the mind of a man named Troy, more widely known as Face Culler, which is (to our knowledge) the first of its kind. He has written thousands of lines of programming code to facilitate a software system that intelligently and intuitively generates braindance music in a matter of seconds, and performs it on a studio rig of analog synthesizers, drum machines and modular units.\nUnlike the generative music of the past, this is music that has been designed to be indistinguishable from something made by a human. In this, we believe Troy has created something groundbreaking and game-changing, and we have a massive amount of pride and excitement to bring you the debut of this project at Recycled Plastics! This is a truly before and after moment in modern electronic music, and one that we feel will ripple outward for a long, long time, both in Troy's hands and beyond.\nFor this special occasion, Troy has indulged our curiosity and helped us put together this informative video, which explains and contextualizes what Procedural Braindance is all about:  youtu.be/U6RNDRj6J2M\nMusically, Pentachroma is an album that refuses to be outshined by the process that created it. If it were never made apparent that these pieces were created by a machine, we would be none the wiser about it. The album is virtually bursting with melodic color and variance - burbling acid lines bouncing over tight, funky drum patterns, and a nearly-constant barrage of fat, warm bass work fills up a nearly-80 minute set of tracks that are built to last. The melodies, as gorgeous as they often are, draw an emotive line throughout the album that perhaps gives the biggest reason to think this was a human's doing.\nProcedural Braindance is absolutely the sound of the future, today. We have arrived!\n(Parties interested in contacting Procedural Braindance may reach him at the following locations:  www.facebook.com/proceduralbraindance/  and  www.soundcloud.com/proceduralbraindance/  )\n**Editor's note: Collectors and completionists would be advised to pick up the limited edition CD-R, which features no less than five additional tracks!",

            "about": "FX JACKSON brings us PICTURE OF A CITY, an album of lush late-nineties flavored bedroom electronics that shifts effortlessly between acidic techno, bleepy synthpop and rubberized electro. Recalling all kinds of classic recordings from Speedy J, Beaumont Hannant and Fuse, as well as shades of Polygon Window and the deeper waters of early Autechre and B12, PICTURE OF A CITY does what so many Recycled Plastics releases do so well: Invoke the past without attempting to compete with it or replicate it. This is headphone or car-stereo appropriate music for wandering and thinking, as well as the more predictable inclusion in a club or DJ set. Flexible, emotive and well-produced, a perfect fit for our ongoing catalog.\nFOR THE HEADS: The limited edition CD-R of BC84 includes an exclusive track called \"Tongo\" and a bouncy Milieu remix of \"Tongo\" alongside it!",
            "credits": "released November 26, 2019\nW/P by Fx Jackson. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Text and design by ABM&D. This is Recycled Plastics number BC84, and 84th in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "At long last, after a year and a half of work, the follow-up to Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker has arrived! Pink Acre is the first of two scheduled cassettes containing the most melodic and playful Coppice Halifax trax in years. Nestled in bedroom warmth and backyard field recordings, filled with echoing moments of adventuring with my daughter, Pink Acre bounds through green grass and crashes into honeysuckles, before curling up on a worn out sofa for a nap in a sunbeam. The music on this release and the Acre that will soon follow is for my daughter Penelope, to assist in her frequent jaunts of toybox carpet fantasies and her humming snoozes in the backseat of my car. Miniature soundtracks for roaming, dreaming, bouncing and brainstorming.",

            "about": "\"Nestled in bedroom warmth and backyard field recordings, filled with echoing moments of adventuring with my daughter, Pink Plastic bounds through green grass and crashes into honeysuckles, before curling up on a worn out sofa for a nap in a sunbeam. Miniature soundtracks for roaming, dreaming, bouncing and brainstorming.\"\nPINK PLASTIC collects two out of print cassette tapes from Spring 2017 (PINK ACRE / PLASTIC ACRE) and reinstates them for the first time on the compact-disc-recordable format, alongside three other tracks from the sessions (Placid Yellow / Litebrite / Pink Plastic) and one previously unreleased track (Amber Pier). Eighteen bouncy wonderlands for playtime, scenic drives and even a few quiet pastoral sections suitable for a midday nap. PINK PLASTIC is the follow-up to MILKWHITE PLASTIC GALAXY MAKER and continues the familiar (but not overly so) path of Rephlexian braindance and early Warpish ambient techno, seen and heard through the lens of Coppice Halifax, a project typically associated with more textural and dubby endeavors. Altogether, it is a two-hour offering of easy and accessible bedroom electronics guaranteed to bring a smile at the end of a terrible and exhausting year that we're all eager to forget about.",

            "about": "At long last, after a year and a half of work, the follow-up to Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker has arrived! Plastic Acre is the second of two scheduled cassettes containing the most melodic and playful Coppice Halifax trax in years. Nestled in bedroom warmth and backyard field recordings, filled with echoing moments of adventuring with my daughter, Plastic Acre bounds through green grass and crashes into honeysuckles, before curling up on a worn out sofa for a nap in a sunbeam. The music on this release and the previous Acre is for my daughter Penelope, to assist in her frequent jaunts of toybox carpet fantasies and her humming snoozes in the backseat of my car. Miniature soundtracks for roaming, dreaming, bouncing and brainstorming.",

            "about": "Originally broadcast live during the release party for Milieu's \"Sunbather's Pharmacopeia (Volume 2)\" at Touched, UK, this mentalist DJ set provides a solid introduction to Telekomm - a new project from Brian Grainger (Milieu, Coppice Halifax, Bike, et al) that has been in development for over eight years. This set is built out of mostly Telekomm trax, with a few adjacent Milieu/Vhom/Troth jams slotted in, but only the eagle-eyed trainspotters would really be able to pick them apart in a lineup. We've indexed the tracks here for easier navigation, but the download for this release also includes the unabridged set as a single file.\nMAXIMUM VOLUME YIELDS MAXIMUM RESULTS\nFor more Telekomm (and there will be much more in the future) please dial \"T\" at  telekomm.bandcamp.com  - There may already be something else to discover there...\nAdditionally, to explore the debut Telekomm recording, please visit Humanhood Recordings and investigate \"Input Void,\" a beatless experiment built with the North American dial tone as its sole sound source, available digitally and on a limited edition CD-R:  humanhoodrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/input-void",

            "about": "A super-special remix album for Milieu's Polypsilon - PolyPlus! Jam packed with eighteen tracks, filled with all the essential braindance minerals and vitamins to get you through your day.\nPolyPlus contains two new Milieu cuts from the Polypsilon sessions: the funky 'PolyPlus' and the mellow 'Polysurpher'. Enlisting the help of producers from both Recycled Plastics' back catalog as well as friends from labels like Occult Research and Cold Tear, PolyPlus is a dynamic fusion of melodic braindance, acid techno and even Artificial Intelligence-era bedroom electronics. A lower PH level than your pool! (Thanks to P.S.A. for the PSA).\nThis album is available on three formats - digital, limited edition CD-R and a super-short-run 90M cassette edition. The latter contains two exclusive tracks - Milieu's disto-funk tape jam 'Sofaphonk 89' and Zander One's overdriven Acid Mix of Polypsilon!",

            "about": "Polypsilon, Part 1 is - as the title implies - the first half of two separate 60-minute cassette releases, and the first tape released at RP!\nAs a Milieu album, Polypsilon is possibly the most \"genre music\" type thing Milieu has done, filled with all the staples of feel-good braindance as well as my first foray into acid. The recording sessions were impulsive and tangential, and by the end, there was far more material than I was expecting to make, giving way to this two-part release.\nIt's probably a spiritual follow-up to Academy Stripes, although it should be noted that Polypsilon was intended to be a sidetrack thing, and not \"the next big new Milieu record\", so I guess consider it as a gigantic 2 hour EP.\nI can't really think about how to describe it, so I'll leave you with the music. There's lots of 606/707/808 drum machine action, as well as my usual soft spot for a couple breaks and my Korg ER-1, and the synths used include my Roland SH-32, Casio PSS-50 and MT-210, the wonderful Fahtacon softsynth made by my friend Robin and of course the Milieu go-to Lowrey Magic Genie organ, among other things. Everything was meant to be loose, sporadic, playful and tingly on the earlobes, so hopefully that comes through in the final result.\nRemember, this isn't braindance - it's BRIANDANCE!",

            "about": "Hot on the heels of Part 1 comes Polypsilon, Part 2! The second half of the BRIAN-DANCE odyssey is another hour of colorful electronics and bedroom production values. Arguably more diverse than Part 1, with krautrock influenced motorik tracks like \"Paul The Pylon\", jungle strains in \"Phallusaurus Jox\", a little Boards of Canada peeking through in \"Polly Epsilon\" and a nod to SAW 85-92 on \"P-Boots\". Of course, melodies are still the focus of the material, along with a nice settled in comfort level from working with so many familiar sounds and machines. The whole thing inevitably caves in by the end, and trails off along some long-lost ambient coastline from the depths of my mind. Printed and pressed on a super-limited special edition of 30 copies on white cassette tape, with hand-cut red cardstock J-cards and black text decals. Don't miss out!",

            "about": "At long last, the definitive edition of Milieu's bedroom wonderland Polypsilon! Collecting all 29 tracks from the Part 1 and Part 2 cassettes, and including four bonus tracks (Sofaphonk 89, from the cassette edition of PolyPlus, Acid Volunteers from the Acid Tryouts compilation, Golden Flake Theme from a super-rare web compilation and a previously unreleased ambient mix of Polly Epsilon), filling out two action-packed CD-Rs dripping with pretty melodies, expressive acid lines and drum work that runs the gamut from house and techno to electro and jungle. Inspired by classic music like AFX, Kerrier District, Ovuca and Bochum Welt, as well as modern favorites like Automatic Tasty, EOD, NN* and Mrs Jynx, Polypsilon is the first truly ACID Milieu effort, where only hints of the sound appeared before on albums like H Is For Hologram, Academy Stripes and Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker - guaranteed to tickle your eardrums and leave you satisfied, or exhausted, whichever comes first.\n\"Strung-out sci-fi synths to skittering drum machines with trance-inducing results\" -Columbia's Free Times\n\"This release is astounding\" -Cybertone\n\"Sounding rather sexy!\" -Some guy on a forum\n\"Spent the last of my wage on this, because Milieu never disappoints.\" -Another guy on a forum\n\"It definitely qualifies as acid.\" -Yet another forum post (Hi WATMM!)",

Taking cues from minimal and dub techno and contributing two tracks each, Process / Detail is a striking and danceable set of loud club-ready grooves. Both CH tracks have been constructed completely live on hardware in the Botany Bay studio, while the CV tracks were selected from the deeper realms of Contemporary Vision's unreleased archives.\nA limited edition CD-R is also available, containing two bonus tracks: a CH remix of Detail and a CV remix of Process.\nMore information about CV (and some of the best techno you've never heard) is available at  www.contemporaryvision.com",

            "about": "Radians is an album by Coppice Halifax that has undergone many iterations and transformations since its original recording sessions were completed in 2011. Somewhat ironically, these transformed versions of Radians (Reflector on Entropy Records, Hallex and Red Sand at Contemporary Vision) have all been released before Radians itself - this was partially due to the nature of the project (differences in label release schedules, waiting on remixes to be completed, and so on) but in some way it has worked in the album's favor by way of referencing something that does not yet exist, creating a sort of mythology about it.\nMusically, Radians is four original pieces of organic Halifaxian techno, mutated and overgrown in the usual fashion. Meticulously decorated with textures, noises and all manner of analog depth, while still sporting vibrant rhythmic structures, dubby basslines, paint-spatter chords and tape-saturated drones, these four works fit well alongside other CH albums such as Narcotic Months and Dusk Versions. Complementing the originals are four remixes - presented in an inverted sequence so that the album unfolds itself in a reverse motion - by Ohrwert, Contemporary Vision, Emi Ono and a particularly deep rework of Melipal by Coppice Halifax. So the symmetry of Radians is complete, with a full eighty-minute album packed tightly onto a CD-R, and packaged minimally in a black cardboard jacket with stickers.",
            "credits": "released December 21, 2012\nW/P by Brian Grainger, except: #5 written by Brian / produced & remixed by Contemporary Vision, #7 written by Brian / produced & remixed by Ohrwert and #8 written by Brian / produced & remixed by Emi Ono. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number RP4.",

            "about": "Prefacing his upcoming debut album for RP (Start Of An Ending, scheduled for release sometime in 2014), DeepWarmth provided us with a lovely expanded-single for his dub techno missive \"Ratio (Of Silver)\". Watery, wavering chords rain softly down on a static bass and kick rhythm that never deviates from its train track. DeepWarmth revisits and revises his cut on a version, then pulls the curtain back to allow a few other producers to have their own things to say through the window of \"Ratio\".\nTextural Being, appearing here under his newer alias aspect., brings an overwhelmingly feel-good organic techno mix, with hints of lush summery house. Zander One bathes \"Ratio\" in blue water, freezes it and then slowly thaws it beneath a soft orange lamp. Optic_ reduces it to a gentle fog of wafting chords and nearly unspoken whispering delay trails, while Axs creates a Red Dye reshape that removes \"Ratio\" from techno confines and transports it to a distant land, somewhere far East, in a crimson desert adorned only by metal bells and stretched-skin drums that are occasionally moved into musical shapes by the lonesome wind. Following this, Ocralab dials in with his usual isolationist approach, sending \"Ratio\" out into the Earth's atmosphere and re-recording it as it bounces back to him over secret radio waves. Closing the experience is an atmospheric Coppice Halifax remix that burns the original track to ashes, makes pigment with the remains and paints a colorfully subdued piece of Impressionist techno across a sunsetting skyline.\nAltogether, the single that becomes an album is a surprisingly varied listen, with very little resemblance to the source material from track to track, and leaves us with high hopes for the next DeepWarmth excursion at RP.\nAdditionally, Coppice Halifax has issued a very limited edition CD-R containing his Evaporant mix, and a second epic 32 minute remix called Glacial Fortress. You can listen to that here:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/glacial-fortress",

            "about": "801383 arrives at Recycled Plastics in a rusting metal rocket that has landed auspiciously in the valley behind our studio. Emblazoned across the side, beneath a small clouded porthole, is the spraypainted phrase \"RAW POWER\". A nice young Englishman steps out, and says his name is Graeme. He opens up a small box and removes a few cassette tapes, gently smirking at an unspoken punchline as he looks over them. He walks over to us, with the tapes held behind his back, and says he has a surprise for us, that we need to close our eyes and hold our hand out. Apprehensive, but always up for some fun, we comply and are promptly punched in the face and knocked out. We wake up an indeterminate amount of time later, at the bottom of the valley, with leaves blowing across our clothes. Graeme and his rocket are nowhere to be found, but as we slowly come to and rise up on our feet, we notice a cassette tape stuffed into our hoodie pocket. There's a note with it - \"Look out honey, 'cause I'm using technology!\"\nUpon further inspection once we reenter the studio, we have a pretty nasty concussion. What the hell, we may as well pop in the cassette while we decompress. Immediately, our ears burst in wide streams of blood, spattering all over the walls and equipment and scaring the shit out of our cats. It's never gonna come out of the carpet. We're not sure how we're going to operate a record label now, without the ability to hear, but we're certain that 801383 is to blame. With no way to locate Graeme and his elusive rocket, our only recourse is to release the contents of his cassette in an attempt to contact him, and get him to pay for our ear surgery. Thankfully, our resident studio wizard The Analog Botanist was able to carefully handle the caustic audio in the proper fashion, and distill from it sound that, while still extremely acidic, is safe for human ears and non-government grade stereo systems.\nHandle with care! And remember, only you can prevent acid fires - this is music from the man who sent our pretty face to hell.",

            "about": "RP12 arrives in the colorful compact-disc formatted album Resume by Volitune. Following a five-year break after issuing stellar recordings at Occult Research and The Centrifuge (among others), Volitune returns with fifteen funky tracks produced on an array of hardware in his bedroom studio.\nLovers of classic drum machines and analog synthesis will find a wealth of enjoyable ear-tinglers on Resume, which somehow manages to remind us of all our favorite aspects of Rephlex, early Warp, Drexciyan Detroit and Chicago acid house, while managing to hold down a very Volitunian mood and flow that seeps out slowly across the runtime. A lot of the material here could easily be dropped into a club environment, but like all good braindance albums, Resume could (and does) also work on headphones and inside car stereos, to devastating effect.\nMost of the \"heads\" reading this text will already know what we mean before even pressing play, but for the one-liners among you: Resume is an action-packed display of bedroom electronic music that already feels as if it belongs in conversations about classic braindance records, and if it's left up to us, from now on it will.\n**NOTE** The first 25 copies of Resume will ship with a bonus 3\" CD-R EP containing two non-album exclusive tracks: \"Energins\" and \"40 Fiver\"\n**NOTE #2** As of this moment, all shipping from the US to the UK is suspended due to post-Brexit VAT laws being changed, and the tax collection/remittance falling to RP. We've reached out to Bandcamp for assistance/information on how best to proceed, so please understand that if you live in the UK and place an order, we'll simply hold onto it until the shipping lanes are reopened. Feel free to email us via the contact form here for additional questions/info.",

            "about": "For the 25th entry in the long-running Bedroom Compost series, we have a special set of three Axs albums, packed to the brim with unreleased works from his personal archives. The first volume, Rosewood Secrets, is a lively collection of 9 tracks that bounce and subside with a monochromatic clarity. Familiar elements of dub and minimal techno are frequent, and Axs keeps things moving from track to track, making Rosewood a varied and fresh listen. Renewed by a concise remastering job (courtesy of The Analog Botanist) and augmented with the addition of two new tracks (Restored Picture A and B - available on CD only) which themselves are reconfigurations of old session materials, Rosewood Secrets reveals only the basic elements needed to fully exhibit the talent behind the Axs name. The second and third volumes of the \"secrets\" collection will be issued in November and December, so keep an eye out for those too.",
            "credits": "released October 19, 2013\nW/P by Axs. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, Summer-Autumn 2013. This is Recycled Plastics number BC25A, and 25.1 in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Tim Gray hails from Portland, Oregon, and although many of you may already know him for his stellar releases as Ethernet at Kranky and Tanuki House at Occult Research, he debuts a new project at Recycled Plastics: Brother Blue. Brother Blue is Mr. Gray's outlet for dub techno, pure and simple, and it delivers on that front in spades. Tim's right at home with his machines and the evidence is in the sounds - deep, round basslines hugging clean-cut beatwork to make dancefloor-friendly grooves that still manage to sedate you at home. Layers of blue reverb that settle over watery synth drones and spattering chord stabs like a soft rain. Here, on his debut EP (which is a not-inconsiderable 50+ minutes long) Brother Blue establishes his intent with a cut taken from his forthcoming full-length (Gradual Brightening), and backing it with two excellent non-album cuts and a massive 20+ minute impressionistic remix from Coppice Halifax.\nThe limited edition CD-R version includes a bonus track - Rebis - as a disc-exclusive. Brother Blue will return soon on the Green Cloud LP!",

            "about": "When I performed as Milieu in Augsburg, in 2007, I met a number of interesting artists, epicureans and musicians. One of them was Matthew, a genuine gentleman who showed us around some very nice wine kitchens. After quite a lot of imbibing, Matthew confessed that he tinkered with making electronic music of his own, in his younger days, but after meeting the love of his life, and starting a family, he'd moved on and sold off his equipment long ago. I was curious to hear his music, especially after he told me how he grew up listening to records by Kraftwerk and Cluster, and then in the early 1990s his mind was blown after he discovered AFX. It was RDJ's game changing work that inspired Matthew to get some affordable gear and try his own hand at what he loved hearing so much. So, after I left Germany, we stayed in touch and I have since convinced him to share his music with me, and subsequently with all of you out there. Matthew didn't even have a cassette player so he actually mailed me the master tape - his debut work Säure Schlafzimmer from 1994 - with his blessing to rip it, master it the best I could and share it with like minded listeners. I did as I was instructed, and what you're hearing is straight from the worn out cassette he laid it to almost twenty years ago! As I write this, Matthew is so pleased with my remastering of his early songs that he's actually looting his storage to find the rest of his old recordings, so I'm hopeful that this won't be the last we hear of Matthew's excellent and colorful music. I've omitted the final track - Bedrohung 707 - to make it an exclusive cut available only on the limited edition CD-R. There are only 50 copies of this in existence, so don't miss out!",

            "about": "In addition to the release of SEAS 2, the original SEAS album from Expanding Electronic Diversity in 2009 (long since out of print) has been reissued in a standard CD-R version, containing all four tracks from the album as well as \"Blue Dub\", the vinyl-only b-side from the Arctic/Blue Dub 12\" (also out of print). For those unfamiliar, SEAS is the third collaborative project between David Tagg and Brian Grainger, and this debut album contains the duo's special brand of dub/ambient influenced techno blended intimately over snowed-in atmospheres of winter waves, cool blue wind and crisp clean textures. Influences include Basic Channel/Rhythm & Sound, Yagya, DeepChord, Vladislav Delay, Porter Ricks and The Orb, and these recordings would also appeal to fans of Brian's work as Coppice Halifax.\nThis definitive reissue comes packaged in a high-gloss mini-LP style cardboard jacket with a factory pressed CD-R inside. A bundle option exists in the SEAS store for buyers interested in ordering SEAS and SEAS 2 at the same time.\nAll orders for SEAS will ship on (or before) September 12, 2012.",
            "credits": "released August 30, 2012\nWritten by David Tagg and Brian Grainger. Produced and mastered by The Analog Botanist. Recorded 2008-2009 in New York and South Carolina. Design and cover art by David Tagg. This reissue is Recycled Plastics number EED1.",

            "about": "After years of work, deliberation, planning, rumors and anticipation, SEAS 2 is finally released.The longtime collaborative duo of David Tagg and Brian Grainger have worked since 2008 to generate what they consider a perfect union of dub, ambient and techno-influenced electronic music and \"assembled landscapes\" (field recordings, white noise, textural overlays). SEAS 2 is a full 80 minute album, containing eight new works that glimmer and sway under humid heat and rainfall at the end of a long sunny Summer. Following up 2009's SEAS, which was filled with arctic blues and icy cool air, SEAS 2 is an appropriate counterpoint to the elemental techno that Brian and David have strived to create since the project's inception.\nAll orders for SEAS 2 will ship on (or before) September 12th, 2012.",
            "credits": "released August 30, 2012\nWritten by David Tagg & Brian Grainger. Mastered & produced by The Analog Botanist. Recorded 2010-2011 at Colonial Gardens, 114RKD and Botany Bay. Design and cover art by David Tagg. This is Recycled Plastics number EED2.",

            "about": "So, last year, Sun Cast happened. The culmination of eight years of recording and writing work, in three studios. Somewhere within the completion of Sun Cast, a second album was gestating, although...as the joke goes...I did not know I was pregnant at the time. As the fumes cleared and the tide receded from Sun Cast, this second album came to be known as Shallow Earth - an intentionally loose, playful, almost low-brow pass at Milieu album, and a much-needed relief from the pressures of Sun Cast's final lap.\nShallow Earth was a title mentioned as a friendly joke by a confidante, playing against my monochromatic Deep Earth series (as Coppice Halifax), and I felt that it was the perfect summation of what I was attempting to do with this material. For a long time, I'd wondered what it might sound like if Milieu attempted to make tracks using the free-running sampling ethos and late 80s/early 90s aesthetic influence that so-called vaporwave recordings have used. Shallow Earth is just the latest example of me setting out to accomplish a thing, and inevitably getting drawn off on tangents and never quite arriving at the thing I set out to do. What you hear on the album is the sound of Milieu having a dance party with a massive amount of samples from pop and dance tracks that I grew up with, bouncing up and down on sofas and beds in my socks as a little kid. Some sources are obvious, others...less so. I don't want to name any here outright, out of respect for the original artists, and a small fear of litigation. The internet has elasticized what's acceptable for sampling, both culturally and ideologically, and it should go without saying that Milieu just wants to have a good time (with or without clothes).\nShallow Earth is Sun Cast's drunken party-animal sibling, eyes watery with too many bong hits, beaming smiles at every stranger he sees, \"Pretty Vacant\" and blissfully ignorant of a tomorrow morning that will never ever arrive. Slurred words, blurry edges, not keeping track of time, pushing that bass way too hard and riding the pitch wheel wobble. At the end of the night, he passes out in the grass after spray-painting the lyrics to Electric Six's \"Synthesizer\" on the side of your parents' house. Shallow Earth is deliberately topical, feel-good electronic music, a palate/palette cleanser, ready for Springtime and sunshine, or CRT displays, video games and cassette decks for when the rain decides to fall. Somewhere within it, are the through-lines that have continued to be the voice of Milieu recordings for years - tropical climes, technicolor melody overload, bent New Wave flangers, greasy Freescha-overdosing funk and some kind of implied past life fantasy, that seeps out of the speakers like a drug.\nFor the occasion of my 36th birthday, Shallow Earth is the perfect celebration. To make it extra special, our longtime comrades at Illuminated Paths are also issuing a super-limited-edition cassette version of Shallow Earth. The \"Illuminated Paths Party Mix\" is a 120-minute extended version of the album, with additional tracks, alternate mixes, warped VHS-tape mastering from Broken Machine Films and a completely different art design. You can obtain one here on 05/17:  illuminatedpaths.bandcamp.com/album/shallow-earth-party-mix-ip-cassette-exclusive\nAdditionally, there will be two singles from Shallow Earth, issued on 3\" CD-R at Milieu Music. The first, \"Amber Petrol'r\" is out prior to the album, backed with two non-album b-sides:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/amber-petrolr  . The second single will follow after the album's release on May 17th.",

            "about": "Following his Automatic Writing single, issued on the Autumn Equinox in late 2018, Brother Blue opens 2019 with Shoreline Drive, a 5-track EP of dub techno cuts and RP's first release of the new year. It is also fitting that it should come out today, during the Super Blood Wolf Moon, a rare celestial event that echoes some of the themes on these tracks.\nMusically, Shoreline Drive brings more excellent electronics on the deeper side of the spectrum to play with the rest of the Bedroom Compost catalog. Tim's work is never less than superb and intimately engaging, and these five tracks are equal parts rugged techno rhythms, sultry dub chords and textured atmospheres that displace the listener. Shoreline Drive recalls not only Detroit classics like Echospace and Deepchord, but also many other deep moments in the Recycled Plastics library, from Ohrwert, Mon0, Axs, Zzzzra, Coppice Halifax and Textural Being, among others...In short, we are beyond happy to have Tim once again here with us, and Shoreline Drive feels both new and home-worn familiar, in all the best ways.\nNOTE: The physical edition of Shoreline Drive also contains two additional tracks: \"Automatic Writing (Version)\" from BC72 and a 2018 remaster of \"Summoning UFOs\", which previously only appeared on a compilation at the luxurious Silent Season label. With these two extras, Shoreline Drive becomes a 67-minute long dub trip, not to be missed!",

            "about": "Occur returns with an encore to their first full-length, SYRUP - the two track SPASSIC EP. Containing two remixes of an unused outtake from the SYRUP session, reconfigured into exciting new shapes and sounds via extensive software automation and FX processing, SPASSIC represents the first of (likely many) junction points for the band. Being Occur's first software-centric production, it allows Brian and John-Paul to lean into their influences from modern Autechre, Demdike Stare and all manner of classic records placed in the \"IDM\" section of record stores around the world. Dense and blinding, like a tangle of forestial overgrowth, SPASSIC is a propulsive and cerebral affair, swinging wildly around a firm axis of a grooving KPR-77 drum machine, giving way to bursts of aural debris and high-velocity slices in the rhythmic pulse.\nA video has been produced for \"Spassic 2\", generated in realtime from the soundwaves themselves, which become transmuted into complex configurations of cuboid shapes and angular lines. NOTE: Due to the heavy use of flashing light and extremely fast visual cuts, persons suffering from epilepsy should refrain from watching this video. To accomodate this, we have included a visual disclaimer at the start of the video itself as well. We apologize for any inconvenience. The viewer assumes all responsibility for their personal well-being.  youtu.be/MuILxgiOkkY\nFollowing this EP will be a related set of two concurrent releases, both of which utilize software processing in much different ways from SPASSIC to recontextualize material from an earlier Occur session that was unfortunately compromised during the recording process. FLOOR and LATT will continue to reshape and expand the notion of what Occur sounds like, and what it might continue to become.\nAdditionally, an ambient reduction of Spassic has been issued at our beatless sister label Psoma Psi Phi, under the OCR header. PASS is a nearly opposite experience from SPASSIC, instead focusing on a deep and Impressionistic depiction of losing yourself inside the forest, while the ruins of cities fall behind you...",

            "about": "Nntblst is a talented young man from Chile who is interested in techno, dachshunds and finding his way via both hardware and software - basically, three of the best things to spend your time on! Special Defects, his debut recordings for Recycled Plastics, are in some parts minimal techno, in others, deep droning synthesizer constructs, scratching our itch for things like Kompakt and maybe even some Sleeparchive or Pan Sonic. \"Think\" is an austere filter-riding drumless beast, and \"Dachshunds\" could easily have appeared on a Reinhard Voigt 12\" in the Speicher series. Nntblst is a frequent live performer, so you can enjoy his material in both live club environments and headphones/home hi-fi setups, knowing he's fully rinsed these tracks in front of unsuspecting crowds.\nFor those of you who prefer hard techno to be an equally physical affair, there is a limited edition CD-R version of Special Defects containing two bonus tracks - \"Rethink\", a rhythmic alternate version of \"Think\", and a Coppice Halifax remix of \"Risset Overtones\" that might just destroy your speakers if the rest of the album doesn't do it first. Get in!",

            "about": "Following his expanded introductory single, Ratio (Of Silver), DeepWarmth returns with Start Of An Ending, his first full-length album for RP. Bouncy, breezy and light to the point of near-translucence, SOAE is the perfect compliment to a sunny and softly humid Spring day. Constructed with only the most necessary elements, SOAE is not minimalistic for the sake of being minimal, rather, it is minimal music coaxed from a state of contentment - there is simply nothing more to say.\nThe limited CD-R version contains an exclusive 9-minute bonus track, a Coppice Halifax remix of \"Reflection Of Yourself\".",
            "credits": "released March 25, 2015\nW/P by DeepWarmth. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC39, and 39th in the Bedroom Compost series.",

Fourteen expertly produced tracks of deep techno forms from Melotone's extensive archives, lovingly selected, compiled and mastered by The Analog Botanist for maximum aural pleasure. Static Mind is an exciting romp through dubby techno stabs, deep ponds of reverb, punchy drum work, a healthy dose of loud bass and plenty of drifting cloudy ambience to soak up. Perfect music to get lost in during those humid summer nights...\nThe CD-R version contains an exclusive bonus track: A Coppice Halifax remix of \"In The Distance\" - get your copy before we run out!",
            "credits": "released August 6, 2014\nW/P by Erik Tavis. Sequenced and mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC29, and 29th in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Syrup is the third official Occur release, and the band's full-length debut. Clocking in at just over seventy minutes, Syrup siphons out a colorful array of sound-play from a surprisingly minimal hardware setup. Improvised live, with no overdubs, on two analog monosynths, one analog polysynth and two analog drum machines, the recording sessions were subsequently finalized with one last coat of paint via software post-processing. Despite Dropper being released as OCR2, Syrup was in fact recorded directly after Drum, chronologically.\nSonically, Syrup shows Occur in a lethargic, almost drunken and drugged mode, with notable references to screwed-and-chopped hip hop, smoked out dub techno and psychedelic synthesizer jaunts that hang like discreet curtains in one moment, and fall down a flight of Berlin-school stairs in the next. Syrup is often a thick, foggy experience, wading through gelatinous oceans marked only by irradiated meteors crashing into the melting waves. Evident are the band's influences things like Autechre's Amber and Oversteps albums, Cylob's Cylobian Sunset, early Deepchord 12\"s and platEAU.\nIn addition to Syrup, both ambient and beat-based reconstructions have been drafted from Syrup's sessions, and these will see independent releases following this issue, with the former at Psoma Psi Phi (www.psoma.space) and the latter at Recycled Plastics  (www.recycled-plastics.net).",

            "about": "Mr. Acid returns disguised as Acid Jock, stealthily sneaking over enemy lines to retrieve the fabled Techno Box, a powerful device loaded with government secrets and untold energies. Before the box's self-destruct sequence was activated, Acid Jock was able to download these 27 data files of pure corrosive acid, with just enough time left to jettison himself from his low-flying plane and parachute safely back into friendly soil. The remnants of the exploded craft landed somewhere in the arctic, where we're told crews of scientists and huskies are attempting to locate anything they can. For now, wrap your ears around this sensitive information, and whatever you do, don't tell anyone!\nTechno Box is the bookend release for the Acid Summer. With Autumn now upon us, the once churning Acid Summer is now burbling down to a simmer, ready to be sipped occasionally over colder months. A very special expanded 2xCD-R set of Squawk/Techno Box will be released in the coming weeks, containing loads of additional unreleased material. Mister Acid will return!",

            "about": "The debut recording by RESPONSE = SIGNAL lands like a silent craft, descended from the purple skies of a post-apocalyptic landscape, metal talons unfurled and clamped into the irradiated Earth. If there were any visible sunlight behind the black smog cloud cover, it would be reflected in the perfect and seamless silver surface of the ship. In the distance, what used to be a canine sobs out a pathetic hoarse bark, and a single pulsing red light beneath the glossy alien vessel's surface provides no response. A process is underway, somewhere deep inside the mecha-mind of this foreign thing - a system of logics and observational data being collated and verified. Perhaps, whatever this unit is, it needed to be physically present for this event, to validate for one last time that the Earth is truly forsaken, and the life clinging to it like rabid rodents to a bone is not really life at all. A clean slate is necessary, a fresh wipe. A blank reboot of this mangled mess, so that it one day may yet produce something worth harvesting...but today, it is a mistake. An error registered through the millions of sensors that watch and listen, a world-state that is recorded and filed so that such scenarios may be avoided afterward. A single decisive click sounds out from beneath the center of this out of place object, and the three tentacular landing prods retract back into its soundless belly. As suddenly as it arrived, it lifts upward, away from the garbage that the humans were too inefficient to eliminate themselves, and begins its recall back to the mind that dispatched it. More reports may yet be necessary, more data to be obtained before this black Earth is remade. From below the choked clouds, curious bloodshot eyes watch and wait for another intruder, staring in hungry anticipation...\n(This album is recommended to fans of Omit, Mika Vainio and Wolfgang Voigt. The ltd. CD-R comes with two bonus tracks, one of which is a 9-minute Coppice Halifax reconstruction)",

A starry eyed and diving-suited collection of clean cut dub techno tracks that sway in and out of electro and slow acid funk waters, the eight cuts on offer here are a lovely complement to the FX JACKSON release out concurrently, and a welcome addition of glossy spacious electronics for the ever-expanding Bedroom Compost series. Fans of the BROTHER BLUE and LAMONT KOHNER recordings we've issued, as well as the MELOTONE, DERIVE DUB and AKRENAUT catalog entries, would do well to take note of this lush set of night-time mindmusic.\nFOR THE HEADS: The limited edition CD-R version of TERRAIN SCAN includes a bonus 10-minute smoky dub remix by COPPICE HALIFAX. Exclusive!",

            "about": "Textural Being is a name that many of you should know by now, if you've been keeping up with who's who in the current dub techno scene. Having released several fantastic works on labels such as Cold Tear, Deep In Dub, Energostatic, ZeECc, Auditory Cortex and Cold Fiction, among others, Mr. Being is now moving on from the moniker, transitioning over to a new project simply called aspect. Thus, The Sixth Gap is (in our humble opinion) not only one of his best excursions to date, but also one hell of an album to close the book on the Textural Being name.\nThe music is deep, moody and evocative of its namesake with swirling soft textures in spades. Groovy bass drums anchor the rhythm in a fog of floaty chords, their constant thumping a ghost of some long-forgotten deep house memory. What Textural Being evokes so well here is an air of familiarity while simultaneously sounding fresh and interesting. In a genre that is no doubt overflowing with homogeneity and monochrome, The Sixth Gap offers a vibrant atmosphere of just what good dub techno could and should be. Backed by a stellar remix cast of Axs, Ohrwert, Yan Olsen and Coppice Halifax, and limited to just 50 CD-Rs!",
            "credits": "released August 7, 2014\nW/P by Textural Being, except #6 written by Textural Being / produced by Axs, #7 written by Textural Being / produced by Arjen Schat, #8 written by Textural Being / produced by Yan Olsen, #9 written by Textural Being / produced by Coppice Halifax. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC30, and 30th in the Bedroom Compost series.",

Well, not completely unreleased - Road Rocks was released on the EED's Summer Vacation compilation album at Expanding Electronic Diversity, but that was forever ago now. These tracks have been carefully selected from Thisket's archives by the #1 Thisket Fan himself - Brian Grainger. Brian has also lovingly remastered this material especially for these two volumes. Shades of classic Thisket are present here, and anyone out there who loved The Golden Afternoon as much as we did will be very pleased to discover gems like Asterisk and the epic Glindrop. The man himself wanted each volume to be cheekily labeled as CD1 and CD2, implying a physical release, even though there is none! These bedroom jams are free for all, so download it, take it out for a drive, enjoy it and tell all your friends about it.",

            "about": "Tom Rimshot's quest for making drum machines fulfill more than just rhythmic roles has continued to mutate and evolve with each subsequent album. Going from the Yamaha QY-70 to the Korg Volca Sample, then making a single with the Yamaha RX21L on BC50, Rimshot now arrives in what could be his strongest effort to date: Tom Rimshot Plays The Memphis Blue Beat.\nThe Blue Beat is a very minimal machine, an analog rhythm box about the size of a guitar foot-pedal, with only eight preset patterns, and dials for tempo and volume adjustment. Originally produced in 1971 as an accompaniment for organists or guitarists, it has found a new purpose in the hands of Tom Rimshot, who sampled five of the patterns at different tempos and proceeded to use a variation on Wolfgang Voigt's M:I:5 ethos of rhythmic loop juxtaposition to create shifting and unique rhythmic passages.\nSonically, the drum sounds themselves only consist of three different tones - a sinusoidal kick drum that somewhat resembles an 808 tom, a more mid-octave pitched version of that sound for the \"snare\" which ends up feeling like half-rimshot and half-rack tom, and finally a higher octave sound that plays into the patterns like a percussion instrument rather than anything resembling a hi-hat (think bossa nova exotica with little woodblocks). Once this palette of sound is overlaid onto itself at multiple different pitches, the resultant techno comes out of the speakers sounding a bit like a cross-modulation between Vakio-era Pan Sonic, Voigt's Profan and Kreisel 99 recordings and perhaps even a bit of early RDJ, such as Polygon Window or Brad Strider.\nThe five recordings are oddly hypnotic, cleanly produced and ready for a deep experience with either your headphones or a club system, and have been paired with five \"acid mixes\" on a second disc, wherein the tracks were played back at different BPMs and quantizations, with an Arturia ladder-filter gain and a modulating flanger placed into the effects chain. Ten tracks for the price of five!",

            "about": "Tom Rimshot is a new face at Recycled Plastics. He specializes in making dedicated tracks for both dancefloor and deep listening purposes, but when he's not turning the Yamaha QY70 into rhythmic quicksand, you can call him Brian.\nTom Rimshot Plays The QY70 is the first of what will likely be several records exploring the tonal and melodic possibilities of drums, drums and more drums, each time with the rule of utilizing a single make and model of drum machine. On this debut volume, Mr. Rimshot advances studies with the Yamaha QY70, a stellar little sequencer built in 1997, when Mr. Rimshot was but a lad of 14 years. With its soft buttons and non-backlit LED screen, much like that of a Nintendo Game Boy, the QY70 can often be overlooked as a dinosaur of its time. However, we would beg to differ on that topic, citing the 70's robust library of \"XG\" sounds and a slew of powerful editing capabilities - making the cute little thing the electronic musician's equivalent of an acoustic guitar. Take it anywhere, it runs on batteries, and you can make entire albums with it, and only it.\nTom Rimshot does not attempt to push this machine to whatever boundaries it exists within, rather, he prefers to let it shine by casting all his weight into the QY's rhythmic programming and playing in it like a swimming pool - sometimes with graceful backstrokes and other times with big cannonballs. Recommended for fans of Profan, Rephlex and Kompakt's Speicher Series.",

            "about": "Tom Rimshot returns to the Bedroom Compost series with his Korg Volca Sample! Employing a unique strategy of playing nine memory bank patterns already present and programmed in the machine (after it was purchased used from another producer) but with a completely replaced file structure/sample library. This means that where the Volca may have triggered a clap before, it could be triggering a hi-hat or a bass kick now. Patterns are legible but do not necessarily make rhythmic \"sense\", providing the perfect setup for a session that goes everywhere from granular drone synthesis to minimal techno workouts, and enough off-kilter electro to recall classix like Gescom's This/That and Skull Snap 12\"s, as well as the early Pentax recordings by Reinhard Voigt at Profan. For the heads, the limited edition CD-R contains two additional trax, TR208 (which goes completely off the rails into so much granular motion sequencing madness that you might think you're listening to Richard Chartier) and TR209, which lands the bird gracefully with a funky hip-hop bounce built with samples from Bob Ross on The Joy Of Painting.\nTom Rimshot will return...with the Blue Beat!",
            "credits": "released July 17, 2019\nW/P by T.Rimshot. Recorded live Summer 2019 in Ohio using a Korg Volca Sample machine and a Zoom H1 digital recorder. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC79, and 79th in the Bedroom Compost series.",

As an additional bonus for the DJs and producers amongst you, Arjen has provided loops from each Tral track, ready to be dropped into your DAW of choice and mixed to taste. The limited CD-R version of Tral comes with two exclusive bonus tracks: Ancestral and Campestral.",

            "about": "Koré debuts at Recycled Plastics with a fantastic EP of rubbery organic electronics, perfect for putting the 'plastic' in RP! Transacids subjects drum machines and synths to a real Acid Summer workout, complete with crisp 808s punching holes in your ears and weirdo acid lines that float and settle over bass notes that have clearly been staying up too late. Koré has a very unique sound that would appeal to all of you braindance maniacs out there, so take it from us - this is some of the freshest acid fried electro zoning we've heard in a long time. Additionally, the good news is that Koré will be following Transacids with a full-length cassette at the loveable WR label in Portland soon. Keep your eyes and ears peeled!",
            "credits": "released August 20, 2013\nW/P by Koré. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, Summer 2013. This is Recycled Plastics number BC23, and the 23rd issue in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "In his debut at Recycled Plastics, the Moscow producer Algorithm T offers up a potent display of spacious minimal techno on the double-album** Ultramarine Slices.\nSlices recalls moments and textures from a lot of our favorite techno here at RP: Studio 1, Plastikman, Thomas Brinkmann's Max Ernst catalog and even some of Aleksi Perala's Colundi series. Feeling slick and perhaps even rubber-coated, but never polished and metallic, Slices conveys playfully and simply a fascination with rhythm-as-melody. Everything on Slices feels as if it was (or still is) a rhythmic device, even the tonal and melodic sections. The droning tones in the backdrop could even be stretched and reduced overtones from a tom or a particularly tonal bass kick. Where most minimal techno is best represented as black shapes in white space, Algorithm T's work feels the way the album cover looks - blue shapes in off-white space. Refreshing and utterly satisfying bounce and dribble for the rainy Spring months, and perfect for the club, the drive to the club or even not going to the club at all.\n**Interested listeners are encouraged to support the limited edition double-disc release, which contains the full 12-track 1.5 hour album.",
            "credits": "released June 6, 2018\nW/P by Evgeny Tkhorzhevsky. Recorded and mastered by Algorithm T. Design and text by ABM&D. This is Recycled Plastics number BC66, and 66th in the Bedroom Compost sub-catalog.",

            "about": "Atlanta's own Ben Wehunt makes his debut appearance at Recycled Plastics with the cleverly titled Un Jour Aux Courses. Earlier in the 2012 year, Ben and I related to one another just how amazing pork rinds are, compared notes on reverb saturation preferences and high fived each other with our drum machines. In many ways, Ben is very much like me, being a bearded southern gentleman who can appreciate good video games, junk food and groovy electronic music. Ben's album is a veritable smorgasbord of all the best sides of the last 20 years of braindance, acid and jungle music, and really is a lot of fun to play at loud decibel levels. While you can freely download the first 10 tracks at Bandcamp, you can also throw a few dollars at Recycled Plastics and come away with a snazzy limited edition CD-R, complete with FOUR bonus tracks and TWO remixes by the RP Remix Crew of Mrs Jynx and myself (Coppice Halifax). Why would you pass an opportunity like this up?",

            "about": "Following the massive 41 track '3067 Megs' charity compilation, which raised money for a nice young lady with health problems in Adelaide (  meganmccarthy.bandcamp.com/releases  ), Recycled Plastics once again heeds the call and steps forward with a second charity effort - this time to help the citizens of Houston, TX in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.\nThis time around, RP collects 18 tracks - clocking in at just over two hours in length - that playfully hop from genre to genre. There are moments of clubby techno, warm reggae dub, majestic ambient scenes and even an epic 20-minute live hardware jam. It's a potent showcase of many different shades of bedroom music, as is our trade here at RP, and the quality contained herein is a testament to the talented people who contributed their time and energy to assemble this compilation so quickly.\n100% of the money made (that isn't taken by Bandcamp revenue shares, taxes or PayPal processing fees) will go to the PTO at Herod Elementary, where a very special RP fan is on the school faculty and will ensure the money goes to the right people and places. To donate directly to Herod PTO, you can click here:  www.herodpto.org\nFrom all of us here at Recycled Plastics, to all of you out there - thank you for your ears, your support and your generosity. Music can make a real difference, and your purchase proves it!",

            "about": "The Petrus is Руслан Петросян, a criminally unknown artist from Russia. He arrives at RP with his third album, Units, following two priors on the Nenormalizm label. Units is an intense record filled with much of the flair and detailed programming work of late-90s Aphex or Autechre, but with the melodic care and disconnected-synthesis of something like Arovane. However, even those comparisons are futile once Units truly gets going. This is a record with a lot to offer, so much so that it might be a little overwhelming sometimes! The difference is that it is dense not with tedium and repetition, but with flavor and color and character. The music feels positively excited and exploding with movement, where no idea is too weird to try, even if it's only for a second.\nUnits is also available on a limited edition CD-R, which contains two bonus tracks and a remix of Young Age by fellow Nenormalizm producer King Imagine.",
            "credits": "released July 22, 2015\nW/P by Руслан Петросян. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC43, and 43rd in the Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Coppice Halifax, originally a Milieu side-project, has now aged a decade. After a full year of painstaking selection, editing, sequencing and mastering, VAPORIZED FOREST INDEX is finally complete. A beginner's guide to the dense subtropical forests and the sprawling Atlantic seaside. Writing and assembling this collection has felt surreal and almost predetermined, as the track selection ended up numbering 33, while I am in my 33rd year. Three discs, as well - themselves grouped according to the general peaks and valleys of the Halifaxian oeuvre - spanning four hours of material from 2006 to 2016.\nThe first Cide, subtitled CARPET, contains fourteen tracks that orbit the earlier Coppice Halifax core of melodic techno. These are tracks inspired by Warp's Artificial Intelligence series, early Rephlex vinyl like Cylobian Sunset, Desktop Robotics and Wasted Sunday, as well as early RDJ like SAW 85-92 and Surfing On Sine Waves. These are the pieces that most easily blur the lines between Milieu and CH, and establish a provenance that spirals further outward into deeper and more textured acres.\nThe second Cide, subtitled CONTOUR, highlights the dub techno phase of CH, with tracks from the Analog Botany and Static Pharming series, Ocean Lion and Pawleys Island. This material is mostly inspired by Rod Modell's early Deepchord vinyl, labels like Chain Reaction, Mille Plateaux and early Kompakt, such as Dettinger or Jonas Bering. These pieces maintain a balance of techno rhythms and warm minimalistic basslines, anchored below layer upon layer of humid chords and restrained melodies - the sum of which often floats in a shallow pool of field recordings and tape hiss.\nThe third and final Cide, subtitled COMPOST, contains the summation of those years lost in the Halifaxian overgrowth. Heavily textured works filled with mammoth drones, orchestral tape loops, guitar feedback walls, modular synthesizer constructs and a truly Impressionistic presentation of ambient music, deep techno and bedroom experimentalism. These pieces have been inspired by GAS, Aleksi Perala's Colundi series, Ourson's Warming Plant album, Mika Vainio's Ø alias, early Vladislav Delay recordings and Steve Hitchell's sprawling Variant, Echospace and cv313 projects.\nAs a whole, these 33 tracks present a cohesive and guided trip through the Halifaxian ten year acre, while also hopefully providing a carefully considered tableaux of works for even the most ardent listener to appreciate. Where Milieu has always been a far more deliberate and composed project, Coppice Halifax eschews traditional forms of songwriting in favor of sonic mining and map making. Compost as composition, synthesis as song.\nFor most of these past ten years, I've not been the creator of these woods and oceans - only a cultivator of analog botany, riding a wave thick with seratonin and surrealism. I've never been a builder, but a draftsman, providing the means for possible realities to enter into existence. Like Michaelangelo digging out the statue from inside the stone, and Monet repainting the Rouen Cathedral dozens of times in different grades of sunlight, I have accepted that there are greater forms in the universe than those I can conjure on my own, and they are far richer things to excavate and frame with so many miles of rippling cassette tape. Shapes in the vapour, phosphenes in the darkness, vibrations and radio frequencies in dimly lit machines, nudged to and fro by a sleep-deprived hand.",

            "about": "After literally years of waiting, mastering, remixing and more waiting, we're honored to present Orson Throb's ambient dub excursion Veditabba. The title, which means \"experience\" in Buddhism (as nearly as we can gather), feels appropriate for what amounts to six meditations on a singular approach: Chords, filters, FX and field recordings, all with a pulse, but not always with actual drums providing rhythm. Similar in tone and mood to our previous releases with Mon0, Substak, Melotone and Textural Being, but altogether a more restrained work, Veditabba provides sonic imagery of a vibrant landscape, filled with sunshowers that gently blanket across green vistas of wild nature. Each track, a consideration and transformation of the last, until we're left with a single wavering tone - a final stroke of the brush, one last thing to say. Orson Throb has a beautiful way with his sound design and sense of placement in a composition - one can never tell if he's letting the reins go while the delays and filters oscillate on their own, or if every curl of a sound, every syllable of these psychedelic tapestries is deliberate and decided. Veditabba is a perfect work of warmth and introspection for us at Recycled Plastics, as we're currently in the Winter season, surrounded by snow in our valley, and we hope you enjoy it just as much.\nAs an additional encore for Veditabba, we've included a nine-minute remix by Coppice Halifax, who Orson Throb remixed extensively for his epic Verdant Compost remix project. Here, Coppice Halifax returns the favor by creating a 7-track nearly 80 minute remix album to accompany Veditabba. This full bonus album is available as a second CD-R, packaged separate from (but sold with) the limited edition physical release of Veditabba (in a very limited edition of 10 copies!). The digital download also comes with additional photographs and an alternative cover, from Orson Throb himself.",
            "credits": "released January 24, 2018\nW/P by Matias Bagato, except #7: Written by Matias Bagato / Remixed and produced by Coppice Halifax. Mastered by The Analog Botanist.

            "about": "The Summer heat has returned, and with it comes the ACID SUMMER '19. What better way to push back that orange season than with some Analordian funk from other_Format - a mysterious producer from the UK who deals in tightly programmed rhythmic bumps on all your favorite drum machines from the days of yore, tied up with acidic burp and wobble, plastic bass and shimmery blue lead lines. All of it comes packed with a heavy dose of detuned melodic movement and a twinge of melancholy that should fit right in with our Bedroom Compost ethos. Of course, all bets are off once you get to \"Steve acid\" and realize you've been personally invited to a very special party...\nFor the heads: Grab the limited edition CD-R, which contains three more o_F trax plus a particularly lenticular remix by Milieu, fresh off his Shallow Earth dance party kick. A full 19 track Acid Summer Xtravaganza, stuff your ears!",
            "credits": "released July 9, 2019\nW/P by other_Format. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Text and design by ABM&D. This is Recycled Plastics number BC76, and #76 in the Bedroom Compost subcatalog.",

            "about": "One of our absolute favorite techno artists, Zzzzra, has finally landed at Recycled Plastics. It is both a thrill and an honor to present you with Vive La Lenteur, an organic and sprawling techno album that isn't afraid to get a little loud. Zzzzra's music is some of the most unique out there today, taking nods from dub, minimalism and experimental music, and concocting a fiercely personalized blend of electronics that really don't sound like anyone else.\nSo, what could be better than seven new Zzzzra cuts for free? How about a double album? That's correct - the limited edition CD-R version of Vive La Lenteur is over two hours in length, filled to the brim across two heavy discs with seventeen tracks, including three remixes by Coppice Halifax, Zwei Kreise and Christonia5. This is Zzzzra's first double album, and our first 2CD set since Mr. Acid's Acid Affairs compendium. This is one of the coolest techno records you will hear this year - don't sleep!",
            "credits": "released November 26, 2014\nW/P by Alex Lehmann. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, Autumn 2014. This is Recycled Plastics number BC34, and 34th in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "While the last two legs of the FACKS TRACS series are yet to be issued, Bike delivers a mentalist set of heavy techno trax built using only the Korg ER-1 drum machine. The ER-1 is a unique machine, in that it only utilizes raw waveforms to generate all of the sound it produces - more like an analog machine, in fact - rather than the more common rompler approach of other units from that time, which relied on digital sample libraries to provide a voice. As such, the ER-1 has been a polarizing unit among musicians - some people hated it, while others (yours truly) hold it in very high esteem. It sounds like no other machine, with the exception of perhaps a modular system that could be designed to function the same way. Loved or reviled, Bike puts the Korg robot through its paces, pushing it to breaking points via dual-routed feedbacking and copious amounts of motion sequencing that seem to overwhelm the machine at times. Minimal and maximal!",

            "about": "Originally released 7 years ago at Expanding Electronic Diversity, Wrangled Mangled has unfortunately been lost and unavailable after the EED label closed in 2009. Compiled from hours of Jaffa's unreleased archives at the time, then sequenced and lovingly mastered by a much younger Analog Botanist, W.M. has always been much more than a fond memory from those times. We at RP have maintained its importance as an excellent volume of underground braindance that nearly no one has known about, and with the advent of RP it was immediately on the agenda to reissue it. Finally, the masters were retrieved from their super-secret and badly-labeled hiding place, and now wrested back onto the great information highway for everyone to enjoy once again, for the first time. To add to the celebration, Wrangled Mangled is being given a physical release as well, hereby claiming its rightful place on the record shelves of so many braindance fans, who really have no idea what's in store here...Press play, and let The Jaffa Kid show you how it's done!",

            "about": "Commissioned for the video game ZEN in Spring 2015, which is currently available on iOS for you Apple users out there, this twelve-track album is a cleanly produced braindance effort, designed to complement ZEN's minimalistic purple and white interface and basic operation, with tracks ranging from the placid to the frantic as the game's difficulty level heightens. As a reference point, longtime Milieu listeners would be able to connect the ZEN soundtrack to previous records like Academy Stripes, Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker and the Phe_ album - all of which just so happened to be released at Recycled Plastics, making this album's appearance in the RP catalog a no-brainer. To be sure, there are moments on this record that are absolutely the spiritual successor to the Phe_ album, so perhaps it's best to be considered in that light, outside of its original and intended context.\nYou can learn more about ZEN here:\nzen.gansrigler.com",

            "about": "After his superb triad of archived Axs works, Alexandre Gouard (better known as Axs and now Zwei Kreise) returns to RP with a fantastically varied album of technoid forms that runs the gamut from dub techno to house, and almost everything in between. ZK XIII contains ten tracks that express funky shapes of rhythm and bass, in a way that only Zwei Kreise can, and exhibit a much wider range of sound design than the Secrets material. Created to have an intentionally multifaceted narrative, the album effortlessly moves between genres with a solidarity and confidence that only occurs when a musician has been at it for a very long time. So come, enjoy the fruits that this strange tree bears!\nThe limited edition CD-R version contains two additional exclusive tracks!",
            "credits": "released November 26, 2014\nW/P by Alexandre Gouard. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, Autumn 2014. This is Recycled Plastics number BC33, and 33rd in the ongoing Bedroom Compost series.",

            "about": "Sint is Mr. Niek Brouwer from the Netherlands, and he makes beautiful electronic music that you've never heard before with machines that you've probably heard before. Operating in the vein of things like Bochum Welt, early Aphex and CiM (with a healthy dose of Drexciya)...basically imagine the most playful and melodic braindance, filled to the brim with catchy synth lines, funky drums and warm analog goodness, and there you are in the midst of Sint's Zonmist. We at RP don't mind confessing to you that Zonmist is one of our favorite things to come out of the label yet, and will probably go down in history as one of the best things we ever released, so really - do yourself a favor and grab this album. If you have a few bucks, do yourself a bigger favor and order a copy of the limited CD-R. It's only packed chock-full of 6 bonus tracks and 2 remixes by Milieu and Mrs Jynx! And there's only 50 of them! Go go go!",
            "credits": "released April 28, 2012\nW/P by Niek Brouwer. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Recycled Plastics number BC8. Eighth in the Bedroom Compost series.",
