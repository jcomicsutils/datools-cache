            "about": "In February of 1959, in Cape Canaveral, the United States Air Force successfully tested the first multistage intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM - given the designation of Titan I. Although these missiles were only in use between 1959 and 1962, their subsequent iterations would continue to be developed for warfare and security purposes, acting as a nuclear deterrent until 1987.\nThe 107A-2 weapon system encompassed all equipment and bases related to these ICBMs, with the Titan missiles being the first designed to be housed within underground silos - the interior wall of one such silo reproduced here as an album cover.\nLSZ recordings continue to serve as a source of both historical information about, and a protest against, the United States nuclear program, as well as a wider condemnation of war and governance through fear, violence and destruction. As it has been stated on prior LSZ releases before: We are no closer to peace or safety, sleeping with these instruments of suffering beneath our pillow.\nPATCH NOTES (2023/02/06):\nOrnament & Crime (Hemispheres / Vector LFO) utilized two stepped-waveform LFOs in the audible range (tuned to 87.06hz and 88.02hz, respectively), which were externally fed additional modulation via a Behringer 1005 Modamp's inharmonic preset CV outs, while the 1005 also ring modulated both audio signals. The resultant audio was routed through a Beep Boop Kontact gain circuit, then multed into Mutable Inst Clouds and Noise Engineering's Versio (running the Multi Versio alt firmware in the Lo-Fi mode). The Versio's output was hard panned L/R in the mixer, while Clouds' output consisted of altered higher pitch shifting, and further stereo filtering via two low-pass filters (2HP and Doepfer A-121-3). Both filters were modulated with parallel/inverse sine LFOs from a Behringer 150 (itself modulated by a Behringer 1004 and a Buchla 258t to create dynamic modulation sweeps), which panned them continually, and this signal was sent through a Disting Mk4 in Stereo Delay (M6) mode, where finally the dry and delay signals were mixed and sent into hard-panned L/R in the mixer. All four output signals were summed and sent into a Zoom H1 digital recorder, which relayed the audio to Goldwave for capturing on the computer. Final mastering and post-session parametric equalization were done via FL Studio 20.",

As the father of a daughter and the husband of a wife who both deeply love mathematics, as well as a musician who often thinks about the profound contributions women have made to all the richest things in my life - music, literature, art, computing - I can sincerely state that every day is Women's Day in my home, just as every day should be Earth Day. Certainly, we'd cease to exist without either.\nmathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Pandrosion/",

            "about": "Originally released on the 1st of June in 2021 at Celebrate Psi Phenomenon, as a part of the second \"PSI-SOLATION\" compilation. I've written a lot about my adoration for both Campbell Kneale's music as Birchville Cat Motel/Our Love Will Destroy The World as well as his storied C/Psi/P imprint - without both Kneale's work as a musician and his operation of that label, none of my work under any moniker would be what it is today, and Milieu Music as a label might not exist either. So it follows that when Limestone Ziggurat was ready for the world as a new project of mine, it meant so much to me to be able to debut it at Kneale's label, and I cannot thank him enough for indulging me an album-length work submitted to his compilation to make this happen.\nSo why this piece, to start with? It wasn't really a completely unique or remarkable piece to debut an entire project with, but this was sort of the point at the time. I'd conceived of a project that would use primarily the modular system to make things as early as 2020, my thinking also coinciding with the pandemic, and at that time I wanted to let it gestate through various informal and primordial sessions (some have since been released as 'Adamantinarx' and the forthcoming 'Isotelus') in order to determine what the project would *actually* consist of, after the novelty of whatever self-imposed \"newness\" wore off and work continued in a more settled fashion.\n\"A220\" was one of a crop of sessions from early 2021, which were strong indicators that Limestone Ziggurat had arrived. It was recorded live, and a broadcast of this session was attempted, but errors kept it from being usable and whatever visual record was made at the time has since been lost. The name and the sound both refer back to the sonic seed at the center of the recording - an A220 pitch in a test oscillator tone present in Behringer's 305 mixer, designed as a reference for tuning other oscillators against, which somewhat infamously does not remain in tune if it is left to oscillate.\nThis simple sinewave was both multed and re-processed through things like Clouds as well as augmented by other oscillators in the early modular system, such as the 3340 \"Curtis chip\" VCO and Cre8audio's Chips dual-oscillator, and more sinewaves via self-oscillating low-pass filters and phasers. There were multiple LFOs from Behringer and Dreadbox driven into the audible range, and Mutable Instruments' Rings was employed for thick resonant slabs that waft over the foundation of held-tones. I cannot remember exactly, but I may have also been using the \"Blue Marvin\" ARP 2600 remake from Behringer in this session too. I did not start keeping detailed patch notes until later on, and somehow, that missing information makes \"A220\" more interesting to me now.\nKnowing I wanted to give \"A220\" a proper singular re-release now that LSZ has blossomed into what it is, I sat down last September to record a completely new take of \"A220\" using the system as it now exists. This session has been offered here in support of the first, labeled as \"Phase II,\" and the very simple patch notes have been included in the track information. It consists of the same A220 test tone oscillator alongside three other Behringer sinewaves from the 1004, 921 and 140 modules - the latter being an LFO driven into the audible range.\nThis reissue also comes with a brilliant photograph taken by a friend on the other side of the globe who generously offered me her talents back when the project I wanted to use the image with didn't even have a name. It echoed a photo I took of my own backyard, and both are included on the physical edition of this set.",

            "about": "Testing session with the DSM02 Character module by Dave Smith Instruments, a now-discontinued stereo signal processor that consists of five different digital effects that share the same signal path - a low and high exciter, a bit reducer, a sample rate reducer and a gain. For the most part, the DSM02 has been plucked directly from the Prophet 12 and Pro 2 synthesizers that Dave Smith produced, and isolated here for the modular format.\nIn this session, you hear squarewave oscillators from the Buchla 258t and the VCZIII A from Feedback Modules, frequency modulating one another, before being sent through the hard-panned stereo inputs on the DSM02. The DSM02's modulation inputs for Girth, Air, Decimate and Hack are all receiving envelopes from the Buchla 281t Quad Function Generator, which itself is receiving eight different sources of constantly shifting modulation from the Buchla 266t Source of Uncertainty and the 257t Voltage Processor, which separately control the attack and decay stages of the 281t's four envelopes. The stereo output of the DSM02 was routed through the Strymon Magneto four-head tape delay system, following a modulated amplifier path for both oscillators in a Doepfer A-135-2, which also received modulation from the Source of Uncertainty. The final output from Magneto was sent into two inputs on the Toppobrillo Minimix, and was recorded in GoldWave where the track was overlaid on itself, truncated and pitch shifted.",

            "about": "\"Achaemenid Cube\" is a work that exists in superposition - that is, it consists of two separate albums, one issued as LSZ and one issued as Limestone Ziggurat, neither of which are considered the original work. They are two sides of the same six-sided object, and yet they are unique and apart from one another.\nPerhaps, visually, you could consider one the outer surfaces of the cube, and the other the inner surfaces of that same cube. Or you could simply look at it pragmatically, knowing fully my predisposition for overly (and unnecessarily) complex concepts applied to what is essentially just another double album. With that notion in mind, I would counter with the questions: If you have always done things one way, and find a way to do them another way, why would you continue to do things as you always have? Why would you decide to make a change?\nMy thinking, when working on pieces like \"Achaemenid Cube,\" is relative to the creative process itself, and the machines I have used to explore these ideas in the first place. Both albums originated using the same patch in the same modular system, with the only differences between them being the waveform shape of the oscillators themselves, and yet this is itself such a fundamental alteration that the entirety of the output changes - the same machines, the same connections between them, and only the manner of speech in their electrical communication changed from sinusoidal to consonant. This iteration of \"Achaemenid Cube\" contains the six Planar Regions in Sine, while the Ziggurat iteration contains the six Planar Regions in Pulse.\nOffered as a visual accompaniment are photographs of two iterations of the same structure, built in two different areas by the Zoroastrian Persians in the distant past. Only educated guesses remain today to tell us what these cuboid structures were intended for - tombs, landmarks, temples of worship? Building a sacred fire? Housing sacred texts? As many reading and listening already know, I often find the remnants of the ancient world enthralling, and it is a continuous source of strangely useful information to spur on the creative act, when I often sit down to work on a modular patch and need only raw inputs of numerators to begin.\nThe past still exists, as evidenced by these ruins, and it is a remarkable feeling to know that something still standing today can be so old that even the ancient world did not know what it meant. Perhaps that alone is reason enough to build and create, if only to make the children of the future wonder.",

            "about": "\"Both action and inaction may find room in thee.\"\n-Helena Patrovna Blavatsky, excerpt from \"The Voice of Silence\" (1889)\n---\nInitally recorded alongside some Deep Urth session work on 25th September 2024, \"Aius Loquens\" is a nearly-naked exploration of the Cre8audio Chips noise oscillator, which is somewhere between a pulse wave, a sample & hold and low frequency noise.\nIn order to \"hear\" this oscillator in more musical terms, it has been used to engage the paraphonic Karplus-Strong synthesizer voices in Mutable Instruments' Rings, which (despite being a somewhat stereotypical staple in the wide world of modular music) continues to illustrate all kinds of interesting shapes and sounds as my modular system expands around it.\nBoth Chips and Rings were two of the earliest modules incorporated into my modular system, so it is interesting to hear them isolated in this way, despite the strangeness and sometimes raw recording quality of the session. \"Aius Loquens\" is another example (like the recent \"O-E U\" or earlier releases like \"Sill\" and \"A Moon With No Sky\") in the LSZ canon that explores melodic music that more or less forsakes melodic resolutions or chordal conventions, and instead presents melodicism as something not entirely different than rhythmic programming, and this becomes especially apparent when the overtone generation present in Karplus-Strong voices offers sound-forms that are not quite percussion, and not quite fretboard music either.\nExperimentally, the session also dabbles in different avenues of both voltage and audio processing, sometimes using a modulated low-pass filter to unconventionally attenuate the noise oscillator, pushing occasional swells of resonation that bristle through the Karplus triggering mechanisms like a blown pipe. In other cases, Goldwave was utilized for granular resampling, fast Fourier transforms and stereo difference in order to isolate and accentuate certain aspects of the stereo image while ignoring most of the mono material.\nAltogether, \"Aius Loquens\" is emblematic of many different but equally active paths of development under the LSZ banner, and exercises a beautiful position of asceticism in its singular focus on only one voice and one unorthodox sequencing source for that voice. It may not be for everyone, but nothing of interest ever is.",

            "about": "More absolute music, this time a held-tone wall using predominantly Waldorf software synthesizers. A dense patch in Largo (Waldorf's earliest VST adjacent to their Blofeld synthesizer - don't tell Ian Fleming), using all twelve available voices (eight of which being wavetables) with each voice frequency modulating itself to some degree. From there, the entire output was multed twice - once through Waldorf's D-Pole for tuned ring modulation and delay, and again through another two instances of D-Pole, for inverted stereo delay and a faux BBD chorus. Aside from these, the only other processors used were two instances of Arturia's Minifilter for some low pass filtering and additional gain. The cover image was itself designed using only a screencap of Largo while the patch was being recorded.\nHere's to four more years in the abyss.",

            "about": "“To know that you do not know is the best.\nTo pretend to know when you do not know is a disease.”\n—Lao Tzu\n'Alight With Bels' is a branching path from 'H. Temple' - issued on a split with NYZ (David Burraston, Noyzelab, et al -  pspsph.bandcamp.com/album/sem-ngexpz2-h-temple  ) to raise money for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund on Juneteenth. It has been plucked from the archive of \"possible pasts\" to be planted here in the Urth, a milemarker for the Autumnal Equinox.\nThe year has passed by so quickly that I feel it was only a short while ago I was writing the same sentiments. Time remains relative, even when I bury myself so deeply in the sound that I hear, hopelessly chasing some sweetly impossible ambivalence. Already, no sooner than the moment these syllables have left my mouth, are they transformed into the laughter of the past - the last black joke from the white visage of Yorick.\nCat#: ON-24/267",

            "about": "Three test sessions for a build of Mutable Instruments' Links utility module from the ever-reliable Happy Unicorn in Poland. These sessions predominantly rely on sound sources from the six modules in my Buchla 200 system - the 292t Quad Lo Pass Gate, the 281t Quad Function Generator, the 257t Voltage Processor, the 266t Source of Uncertainty, the 258t Dual Oscillator and the 245t Sequential Voltage Source - and experiment with the three distinct components of Links, which are a 1:3 multiple, a 2:2 unity mixer and a 3:1 summing mixer. Additional modulation and processing was sourced from Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay system, Beepboop's Tape Sampler in the filter mode and Toppobrillo's Minimix, particularly channel inputs 1 and 6 which feature dedicated modulation controls for their stereo panning. Post-proc includes some equalization via Pulsar W495, low-pass filtering via Goldwave and compression via Audio Damage Rough Rider 3.",

            "about": "Amchixtax̂ is the Aleut name for what is now known as Amchitka, a small volcanic island in southwest Alaska, and one of the least stable tectonic environments in the United States. It was populated for over 2500 years by the Aleut people, and in 1971, became the site of the largest underground nuclear test (five megaton) in United States history, Cannikin. On today's date in 1971, the first Greenpeace vessel set out to the island in a voyage of protest, which ultimately failed. Prior to this, Amchitka was also used to host a White Alice communications system from 1959 to 1961. The Department of Energy continues to monitor the site as part of their remediation program. This is expected to continue until 2025, after which the site is intended to become a restricted access wildlife preserve.\nThis recording's album cover is a photograph of an artificial lake that was created to fill in the borehole at Cannikin, taken by L. Sheader and reproduced here with gratitude.\nPATCH NOTES:\nMutable Inst.

Allen Synthesis EuroPi (Harmonic LFOs) sent five different curved sample & hold waveforms (1/7, 2/3, 3/6, 4/32, 5/17) to modulation inputs for Stairs' left and right frequency control, global frequency control, bias control (starve) and resonance control. A sixth waveform (6/23) was sent from EuroPi to Links 1:3 multiple, with two mults sent into MISO for inversion/attenuation, which were then routed into CV inputs 2 and 3 on Ornament, modulating the shape of the wavetable and the phase/frequency spread between outputs 1 and 2. Stairs' eight outputs - left and right outputs for high pass, band pass and both 12 and 24 decibel slope low pass - all sent to Doepfer A-138s and Toppobrillo Minimix stereo mixers for panning and mixing. Recorded live in GoldWave at 16 bit-depth and 48000 hertz sampling rate. Post-proc included selective time-domain pitch shifting.",

And so, as we sink, this recording marks the Summer Solstice.\n---\nSinking through the layers\nRegressing to the outer borders\nApproaching the darkened command centre\nEdified in the blank landscape\nYou are here with the rest of us\nHeld in the thrall of another long winter\nTelling ourselves it must be warm again someday\nUntil we just can't remember anything else\nMaybe the world has always been this way?\nI can only curl up beside a fire\nZoned and dethroned\nAnd go to sleep until tomorrow",

            "about": "This is the first iteration of 'Bin Tepe' - initially one of several outtakes/variations from the sixteen-oscillator session that produced 'Cenotaph' -  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com/album/cenotaph  - presented here in two halves that together form the (w)hole.\n'Bin Tepe' explores specific sections of the frequency spectrum, highlighting both lower and higher ends while diminishing much of the gulf between those areas, where most of the more \"traditional\" harmonic content in a droning chord exists. Instead, the listening experience is animated by a lively group of ear-tickling upper frequencies and supported by a foundation of almost totally subharmonic bass. Only here, in the world of sound and vibration, is it possible to stand at the top of a mountain peak and remain prostrate at its feet.",

            "about": "The LSZ iteration of 'Bin Tepe' is a highly textural affair like the Ziggurat version, but instead magnifies the sustained tone material in the session until it oversaturates itself and blooms into exciting new harmonic realms.\nN.B. Listeners who are looking for a subtle experience may want to reduce the volume on this album by quite a lot, or skip listening altogether. As Soma and The Lord succinctly state: Maximum volume yields maximum results.",

In this sense, 'Chrysopoeian Waves' is as much about me returning to bare basics for comfort's sake as it is about really going deeper into this familiar program to see what it can still teach me.",

            "about": "\"Col\" is the result of the first testing session with Nonlinearcircuits' This 2 Shall Pass - a two-input passive analogue XOR (exclusive or) gate that possesses some unique behaviors, with the design being taken from a 1970's electronics magazine. Here, it combines squarewaves from the Stylophone CPM DS-2 and two modules from Bastl (the Tea Kick and Noise Square), with a little bit of shaping assistance from the Buchla Quad Lo Pass Gate, using This 2 Shall Pass as a dual ring modulator alongside the oscillators' dry signals.",

            "about": "Originally recorded on March 11, 2024 using a Behringer Model D analog monosynth, loaned to me by close friend and visual guru Greg Lawhun to investigate a potentially misbehaving filter. Subsequent sessions with the Model D ended up producing the \"Dis\" triple-album, and shades of that album recur here, in a session focusing on running all of the oscillators back into each other to frequency modulate them and bend them into much different waveforms. The original recording was then overlaid onto itself two subsequent times, each iteration being re-tuned by ear to produce the triptych wall before you now.",

            "about": "N.B. Timbral Ocean Ø\n\"Desiccated Triad\" contains three different sessions from three different dates which all attempted to process recordings of atonal sound in tonal ways. None of the three pieces offered here turned out the way I'd originally theorized they would, given the lengthy list of on-paper processing steps and specific methods of synthesis I'd worked with, and perhaps because of this, I feel they are more unique and provocative. With experimental music such as this, it is sometimes preferable to say and write less about it, and simply let the sound speak, and so \"Desiccated Triad\" is offered to you without further commentary.",

In this tripartite session, all three oscillators used different waveforms (see below) and were supplemented by the LFO brought into the audible range and mixed via the external input. Summed output slightly filtered via a Doepfer A-121-3 low pass filter before being routed through a Strymon Magneto four-head tape delay unit with outputs hard panned L/R through a Behringer 305 mixer.\nSession 1 - Triangle wave oscillators, triangle LFO\nSession 2 - All three square/pulse wave oscillators, square LFO\nSession 3 - Ramp wave oscillators, square LFO\nSpecial thanks to G.L. for graciously offering me his Model D during the time he is not using it. These sessions and this release are for him.",

It was still in operation in the beginning of the 2010s, with a power level of 24 kW, making it, at that time, the world's oldest operating reactor.\n77 years later, nuclear power has indeed advanced our civilization's technical capabilities, but in a dark irony, this progress came only with the unforgivably high cost of civility itself.\nN.B. 2024: This recording was meant to be published on December 25, 2023, but due to the unexpected necessity of a deeper mastering pass, it has been held from publication until now. The intent behind this release is, unfortunately, still relevant.\nCat#: RAT-23/359",

            "about": "\"She is whole and yet never finished. As she works now, so can she work for ever. To every one she appears in a form of his own. She hides herself in a thousand names and terms, and is always the same. She has placed me in this world; she will also lead me out of it.\"\n-Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\n---\nA tripartite session of dense wall construction from late October, building with NonlinearCircuits' Fourier and Mutable Instruments' Rings. Something to surround yourself with on a snowy day.",

            "about": "\"Upon the curvature of a hill\nGrass to heel, ranges glimpsed\nThe glimmer of a sword like a noonday star\nThat guides the praying hands of a king\"\nThe second tangential loop-based work built out of a feedback session with the Future Sound Systems MTX9A pin matrix, and another view of the endless. In contrast to the previous release, 'Upon the Curvature of a Hill', this album returns the looping structure to something seamless, resembling a wall, but ultimately just a cascading linearity of windows that do not have obvious recursive points. Every oscillation is a loop, every loop is an oscillation, suspending us in a liminal space that is not past or future, but forever the present moment.\nCatalog designate: UR-23/061\nSource sound: Future Sound Systems MTX9A pin matrix (feedback loops)\nImage: Luigi Mayer / Reprocessed by ABM&D",

            "about": "Halftone Burn consists of two variations of the same recording, processed one after the other using a combination of fast Fourier transforms to alter the length of the recording in greater and smaller amounts, octaval pitch shifting and granular re-sampling, in order to achieve a sort of aural representation of the generational loss that occurs when you re-scan a photocopy over and over.\nThe original session was recorded on 25th December, 2023 with Vector LFO in Ornament & Crime driving four modules from Behringer's ARP 2500 remake line - the 1004 oscillator, the 1005 Modamp ring modulator and amplifier, the 1006 Filtamp low-pass filter and amplifier and the 1047 multimode filter and resonator. A wealth of such sessions exist in the archives, and will eventually see daylight when the time feels right.",

In their natural state, these materials are nothing more than evidence of a process in motion, which itself is within another cascading sea of processes. The absolute nature of creative thought is a state of endless and boundless exploration, done in the name of expression for its own sake, a joyous and all-encompassing communion with the forces of the universe, whatever they may be, and it exists outside of time, apart from everything.\nThis so-called act of finishing, of \"turning in\" a complete work, is nothing short of a job, an act of utterly mundane ritual and meaningless definition that still allows plenty of open space for the inscriptions of passersby, themselves allowed to scrawl into it whatever they wish to feel, passive and inert as they sometimes are. Forced contexts and retconned memories. Drawing this line of separation willfully around the creative act is what holds the pleasure of creation hostage - it provides an end to an otherwise continuous river of ideas and impulses, pure and reactive from one to the next, everything given time and space.\nThis is a river that has no beginning or end, it is simply in motion for as long as the artist draws breath, and it is as intricately a part of their ability to live and survive as all of the blood in their bodies. The creative act is everything. The work can never be finished. You lean down at the edge of the river and cup your hands to fill them with the water. As you do, you become aware of the reflections in the surface - every creative act, every idea, every accomplishment, every regret and consideration and revelation of human creativity is there, like a family tree, leading directly to you, to here, to now. All that follows is to simply become a part of it yourself.\nIn this way, the creative act provides an answer for that most basic of human needs - purpose, meaning, belonging. You can only ever be what you are. What may yet take you or I years of our lives to discover, the mouth of the river just laughs at us, and beckons us closer in our realization of what it has been all along.\nThat river carries with it all of the sediments from the river floor, from the water's edge, and the forests and mountains beyond it. Those mountains, an accumulation of this sediment, built only by time and entropy's forward march, which will in turn break them down again to rejoin the river as so much endless particulate. The statue inside the stone remains inside the stone - all the statues and monuments that have ever been built are waiting there, deep inside the rock, the totality of their constitution being nothing more than grains of sediment packed tightly together.\nExcavating those monuments is only our feeble and human attempt to redefine the world as we'd like it to be, not quite realizing that irony creeps up, informing you that you haven't changed anything, you haven't made anything new, that such things are impossible given the grand scale of the natural world. Instead, all of your proposed alterations have been communion with that world, bringing yourself closer to the beautiful chaos that embodies the way of all things. Those reflections in the river's surface echo back to you - no different than a flesh and bone variation of the sediment of eroded mountains and sun-kissed beach sands, gathered up by the wind and the waters. So too are we here, in the creative act, looking in a cosmic mirror at ourselves, in all worlds and times.\nThis release is not a finished release, nor will it ever be. Even when the last piece of recorded sound is appended to it at some unnamed date in the future, it will be declared as incomplete. Any written record that testifies this release is complete will itself be a lie. It is the explicit intent of the artist that this album, and its darker half, both be considered as permanently incomplete.\nN.B. - For more detailed information about each piece, usually including patch notes, explore the \"Track info\" sections of each individual recording. This release will be added to periodically and sporadically throughout the year, and the price of admission will remain the same. The cover design is likely to change as well, and prior generations of this design will be included with this release as bonus downloadable files.",

Braids + Rings, 2HP Pluck) sequenced by Quantermain in Ornament & Crime, playing \"Porcupine\" scales with CV source via Euclidean pattern generation.

Clouds. Magneto also uses a Disting Mk4's mono to stereo reverb (L3) for an auxiliary send, and many aspects of Magneto and Clouds are modulated/triggered via several different LFOs and trigger outputs from Blue Lantern's CMOS Party (Boolean gates) and CuteLab's Missed Opportunities (probabilistic gates). The final result of these two modules' outputs is sent into a Behringer 305 stereo mixer and recorded.",

                    "about": "Third session to date with Tiptop's model 258t and 281t Buchla modules. Ornament and Crime is being sent three different triggers from Missed Opportunities - each one probabilistically subtractive based on the previous one - which is itself receiving master clock signal from CMOS Party, which is generating Boolean gates from two clock divider outputs coming from a Doepfer A-160-1 (global clock from Behringer 150).\nWith these three triggers, Ornament uses Euclidean sequencing as CV source to play three different generative melodic passages in mixolydian scales. The first two sequences are conveyed through the two oscillator voices of the Buchla 258t, while the third is sent to the v/oct input of Clouds.\nBoth of the 258t's VCOs are sent into low-pass filters (2HP + Doepfer A-121-3) that are themselves separately modulated/swept by an array of four different LFOs (from Dreadbox Ataxia/Utopia/Behringer 150>Wildfire Labs Equation Group) that are mixed via a Doepfer A-135-2 VC mixer, and modulated inversely (the VCA path of LFOs 1-4 are modulated by LFOs 4/2/3/1) and these outputs are sent to Tiptop MISO for mixing and multing.\nThe 2xVCO signals are multed from their respective LPF outputs and sent to Clouds and Strymon Magneto, which are both summed via Disting Mk4's E5 stereo compressor, and sent to Behringer 305's first two hard-panned inputs.\nThe Buchla 281t has brought all four envelopes into the audible range, and tuned by ear into a four-part chordal structure, grouped into 2 envelopes each and sent into the 305's third and fourth panned inputs to provide a nearly static drone bed beneath the wavering melodic passages generated by the 258t.\nSomewhere in the process of the recording, pitches began to deviate slightly - possibly from voltage bleeding through some of the LFOs - although the effect is still pleasant enough to listen to that I found this admissible.",

            "about": "'Impulse' is a session exploring the range of a digital synthesizer that is designed to emulate the SID chip within the Commodore 64. Whether or not this emulation comes close to the original chip is not necessarily the point of the investigation, but rather, what possibilities are brought forward when these sounds and designs have been migrated into a DAW environment. The resultant session is a humming turbine engine, not heard necessarily, but felt through several resonant spaces inside of a metallic structure.\nCat#: ONE-23/046",

            "about": "Hurricane Helene has devastated Asheville, North Carolina. It is a mountain hippie city where I got married in 2004, where I saw Autechre play in 2015, where I considered spending my twilight years in the time before I decided to leave the Carolinas forever. Despite being in the mountains, the whole place is underwater.\n\"Initiation Wells\" is a set of multiple takes (my first) exploring the Nonlinearcircuits Triple Sloths module, which outputs a set of three very slow modulation sources that are derived from Lorenz attractors, and here illustrates those movements through the three axes of Synthesis Technology's E352 Cloud Terrarium wavetable synthesizer. It has nothing at all to do with Asheville, or hurricanes, or human suffering - which is why I am using it to raise money for the rescue and restoration efforts underway in Asheville at this moment, doing my very best from hundreds of miles away in Ohio to help out this city that I love dearly as much as I can.\nAll money made from \"Initiation Wells\" will be sent to BeLoved Asheville -  belovedasheville.com  - a very awesome group dedicated to all kinds of relief and assistance. Any purchase of $25 or more will receive a download code for a divine bonus recording that isn't publicly available otherwise. The code is not automatic, but will be emailed to you manually by yours truly once the purchase comes through on my end.",

            "about": "\"Interior Landscaping\" is a record I've imagined for many years, having a long-time fascination with the overtones and combined frequencies in various rooms and buildings I've lived in.\nWhat I mean to say by this, probably ungracefully, is that every now and again, there is a beautiful culmination of harmonic information floating in the air, an entirely incidental mixture of appliance and electrical humming, partially blocked duct work and vents, and perhaps even something in the close vicinity outside the building, such as a nearby lawnmower or road work crew.\nDuring moments like these, I've tried very hard to locate the most ideal physical position in a given room to record it, which is quite difficult, when the specific combination of sounds can only be \"glimpsed\" while standing in one exact spot, with my ear turned to one exact direction.\nThe recordings offered here are probably the very closest I have ever been able to get to capturing a moment like this. Even now, as I type this, fully content with the quality of the audio-fabric I'm offering to you, I can unequivocally state that I only managed to capture a facet of the real room tone I was trying to record. These pieces have turned out well, despite this, so I come away relatively satisfied with the attempt, but I am sure I will continue to try again and again later, and when that happens, it will be interesting to have this release in hand to compare it with.\nMusically, texturally, and so on, \"Interior Landscaping\" takes cues from many of my favorite atmospheric artists, from Aube, Howard Stelzer, Rod Modell, Francisco Lopez, Richard Chartier and Nicholas Maloney - the latter of whom was particularly influential to me on this release through his superb box set \"Forms Within Spaces,\" which I had the pleasure of publishing for him at Psoma Psi Phi in 2020, five years ago almost to the day.\nAnd five is most certainly the magic number here - Nicholas' album and my own are both five pieces that run for exactly one hour - and again and again many times over it is possible to find synchronicity of the numerical, thematic, musical and otherwise when dealing in abstracts and minimalism.\nThis is perhaps one of many reasons why laboring for hours over music that presents itself as disarmingly simplistic is so rewarding, like applying dozens of coats of paint to a canvas that are each so thin that the naked eye cannot detect them, but without those layers, the piece is not the piece.\nAnd in this situation, when I am working with nothing more than the sound of air and hum in an empty room, shaping it and layering it into something that resembles a chordal structure, I am once again confounded by the possible density of something that is not really there.",

            "about": "While searching old hard drives and backups for something else, as it often happens, I happened upon this session of primordial Ziggurat from Autumn of 2020, apparently recorded impulsively, perhaps meant for some other project or purpose, but either way labeled as \"Ziggurat\" and filed away to be forgotten about.\nMuch like the three pieces plucked from the early archives on \"Adamantinarx\" and the three \"Litho\" takes, \"Isotelus\" offers yet another glimpse of what was gestating in those first two years of my modular development with regard to Limestone Ziggurat - a project I had already conceptualized and named by mid-2020, but wanted to hold back from announcing and publishing for a while, so I could consider it more carefully. I knew then that Limestone Ziggurat, whatever it would become, was going to be my \"next phase\" of creative working and thinking, and so as the fifth year of my travels with my modular system now begins, I felt it pertinent to share this look back.\nSo what has changed? What has remained the same? It's clear that this session was probably done stoned, hence my forgetting about it, and also because it resembles a fair bit of the first and third \"OHMM\" releases, which were themselves recorded that same month. At this early stage, influences from O))) and other sub-bass explorers are obvious, and in a strange modular music way, \"Isotelus\" almost feels like Ziggurat doing a doom album.\nAltogether, it still thrills me to listen to it now with a nice pair of headphones, excessively loud, almost five years later, and it makes me even more excited to think about how much more distance and time Ziggurat still has yet to cross. Maximum volume, as ever, will yield maximum results.",

            "about": "LC9x9 is one of several stress tests recorded within the Doepfer LC9 modular case, one third of the greater R-EW Audioholistics modular system, which utilizes several less-stable sound sources that tend to deviate in pitch more easily over longer runtimes.\nPrimarily, the voices of both oscillators in Cre8audio's Chipz module are heard, alongside Wildfire Laboratories' Sovereign oscillator, with supplemental assistance from two Doepfer A-188 BBD units (256 and 1024 stages), a Doepfer Phase Locked Loop module, filtering via Beepboop's Tape Sampler and gain coloration via Wildfire Labs' Weird Vector (high and low rectifiers) and Sandevistan, Beepboop's Kontact gain/piezo and Noise Engineering's Kith Ruina overdrive.\nEverything was summed via Dreadbox's Utopia, Wildfire Labs' Equation Group and SSDP's switch mixer before being final glossed with parametric EQ, compression and additional filtering on the computer.\nCat#: ON-24/092",

            "about": "\"Upon the curvature of a hill\nGrass to heel, ranges glimpsed\nThe glimmer of a sword like a noonday star\nThat guides the praying hands of a king\"\n'Like a Noonday Star That Guides the Praying Hands of a King' concludes the unanticipated polyptych of five loop studies, each meditating on an aspect of a poem that has been reproduced with each release.\nThese recordings have organically surfaced while working on other sessions, sections of modular improvisation, generative music and feedback that caught my ear in a certain noteworthy way, and were set aside to fulfill entirely different purposes.\nIn many ways, this is the core philosophical view that informs all five releases, the notion that entire worlds of sound always exist in the periphery of what may otherwise seem like a very focused creative vision, which both humbles and frustrates me, leaving me feeling as if I do not quite grasp the profundity of the sound being brought into existence by my own tools, and often makes me wonder how much has been lost in the act of throwing away so-called 'failed' work?\nThese five releases do not provide any real answer, beyond their self-evident nature, illustrating that the craftsman does not necessarily know what is best for his craft, that this is a realization of the human condition, at the mercy of estimation and imprecise prediction. Arthur Machen once prosaically described the creative act in this way: \"One dreams in fire and works in clay.\"\nSo what remains here is one last recurrent structure - an isolated fragment of a larger session with a Karplus-Strong digital synthesizer and a digital reiteration of a four-head tape delay machine, which was initially recorded on June 18th, 2021, and subsequently also yielded three other expansive loop-based pieces for Milieu's 'River Ores IX' in the Vibratelepathos series. This piece is a more drone-oriented shadow of those three loop studies, which are more melodically informed, and I find myself beautifully lost within its drifting tone, waiting for and pleasantly re-experiencing the one broken moment in the wavering line, where the loop shifts and restarts, making the mathematical simplicity of the work's design apparent.\nIn the end, so much preparatory effort and sonic experimentation is broken down into the most earnest of parts, each one like a small gem through which we can see a small portion of the past, repeated ad infinitum - or ad nauseam, depending on your level of patience and expectation - and I am where I was always meant to be, again standing here where I started, considering the creative act, pondering my placement within it, left with more questions than answers as the loop drones on, ambivalent.\nCatalog designate: UR-23/176a\nSource sound: 2HP Pluck Karplus-Strong paraphonic digital synthesizer\nImage: Luigi Mayer / Reprocessed by ABM&D",

            "about": "Two early sessions experimenting with the Nonlinearcircuits Fourier and the Moog Subharmonicon in conversation, originally recorded on different evenings in October 2024. Both sessions involved additional post-processing passes with various sound tools from GoldWave, Airwindows, Image Line and Arturia. The second session was also supplemented by an ARP Odyssey synthesizer. Fourier, Subharmonicon and Odyssey are all radically different machines, but work together in a unique type of synergy. More detailed patch notes for both sessions are included in the sub-menus of each track.",

            "about": "Two extended sheets of re-colored variation by Limestone Ziggurat, drafted in celebration of the fourth volume of Microdot Transmissions issued under my birthname. These are extended and slightly altered mixes of the Microdot Transmissions \"Buried Fortress\" and \"Without Purpose\" and act as a double-album gradient epilogue to the 18 discs of Microdot sessions that have to date been released.\nTo celebrate these sessions, a special and ultra-limited 20xCD-R dustproof ring binder set has been assembled, which contains Microdot Transmissions (Volumes 1 / 2 / 3 / 4) and these two LSZ variations as the closing 19th and 20th discs. Purchase of that box set will include a Bandcamp download for both sessions included here.

            "about": "'Molybdos' is a held-tone composition that explores two low-frequency squarewave oscillators (generated by the Vector LFO mode in Ornament & Crime's Hemispheres alternative firmware, each with a slightly different pulsewidth) beating against each other at 57.02 Hz and 58.01 Hz respectively. Both oscillators were then summed and shaped through a Behringer 1005 Modamp ring modulator and 1006 Filtamp low-pass filter, before being multed with signal 1 sent directly into a Noise Engineering Xerest Pola stereo mixer, and signal 2 being processed through an SSDP Jade series phaser, with the all-pass filter output sent into Xerest Pola alongside signal 1. The phaser employed a Behringer 1004 oscillator in low-range mode for subtle frequency modulation, and the resultant recording was further post-processed in three different ways - via a three-part panned delay in Goldwave, a FFT/granular resampler in Goldwave and a third pass combining both.\nDesolate, commanding sound that forms a wall around the listener, with hypnotic modulation and a timbral profile that recalls power stations or large electrical generators, 'Molybdos' exists alongside sessions undertaken for the 'OHMM' series and other heavier works such as 'Pillar of Persephone.' Inspired in large part by the ring modulation studies conducted by David Burraston at Noyzelab, and offered here with thanks to Burraston for his generous sharing of knowledge.\nCat#: ON-24/033",

            "about": "\"Well, I don't really think that the end can be assessed as of itself as being the end because what does the end feel like? It's like saying when you try to extrapolate the end of the universe, you say, if the universe is indeed infinite, then how - what does that mean? How far is all the way, and then if it stops, what's stopping it, and what's behind what's stopping it? So, what's the end, you know, is my question to you.\"\n-D.S.H. '84",

            "about": "Tellus habet in se corpora prima\"\n-Lucretius, 'De rerum natura'\nTEN HYPAETHRAL COMMUNIONS collects the first ten recordings in the open-ended OHMM series - named for the Ohio Medical Marijuana program - which explore the heights and depths of modular drone music, deep listening meditations and heavy \"anti-riff\" methodologies (quoted with thanks to the Riff Merchant), all from the perspective of a conductive human body with a bloodstream saturated with Tetrahydrocannabinol. It is the embodiment of \"taking drugs to make music to take drugs to,\" following in the long tradition of doing so, from every pole of the stoner continent - Sunn O))) and Coltrane, Sabbath and \"Psychocandy\" - continuing to pass the green torch from lung to lung in the riff-filled land.\nFor those reading this who choose to abstain from marijuana use, please feel welcomed here also - it is my sincere desire that Limestone Ziggurat recordings offer a multifaceted and immersive listening experience, which is not at all bound by drug use or situational contexts, but rather, can be used as a meditation or sleep aid, a reading companion or an emotional reset button for an over-tired brain at the end of another long day - incidentally, many of the same uses I personally have for my marijuana prescription - and so in this context, OHMM sessions have been referred to less as \"music\" and more as \"utilities\" in the wider landscape of my day to day writing and recording work. They symbolize, at yet another level, the \"holistic\" aspects of my Audioholistics modular system, offering to the general public what I hope might function as a psychedelic experience without the need for a drug - although whether or not this proves to be true is entirely up to you.\nCasting aside all prosaic pretense and technical details, these are ten sessions of loud music - no, loud sound - that alleviated pressure and pain in both physical and mental ways, at every point in their red-eyed and dry-mouthed creation. OHMM is the sound of the Ziggurat pushed up to 11, projected into the open sky, oversaturating the air with green-tinted vibrations. It is both redundant in its complexity and transcendent in its simplicity, and although sound such as this cannot exclusively exist with the augmented perspectives that THC provides, the chemical influence on the creative mind can prove to become an efficient intermediary, and it continues to summon me, slack-jawed and lucid, prostrate in a beautifully vibrant landscape of bristling soundwaves, wondering how I ever found my way there to begin with.\n---\nCat# LIME-25/110X\nN.B. - Offered here in addition to the digital collection is a very limited 20xCD-R ring binder set, which contains all ten OHMM sessions and all twelve INDICA MONOLITH sessions, which transfigure the OHMM material into something more \"ambient\" but equally enveloping. This expansive set comes with a download code for the INDICA MONOLITH material.\nINDICA MONOLITH is also available as a separate digital release from THE RIFF MERCHANT in Saint Paul, MN who have also printed up some OHMM-adjacent LSZ t-shirts:  riffmerchant.bandcamp.com",

Both oscillators using pulsewaves with both filters in high-pass mode almost completely resonant. Output to B305 mixer, then into Strymon Magneto in Shift mode. Magneto dry and wet outputs sent to Toppobrillo Minimix. Recorded live in GoldWave at 16-bit depth and 48 kHz sampling rate. Post-proc in FL Studio using two tuned instances of ring modulation on two multed copies of the original signal. THE GREEN WALLS OF THE ALGAE COVERED CONCRETE ZIGGURAT SHUDDER IN A DEEP INHALATION.

            "about": "Eight held tones to commemorate the sixtieth anniversary of the first communications satellite launched into Medium-Earth orbit, Telstar 1, built by the minds at Bell Labs. Telstar 1 was only active for seven months, before failing completely due to interference from a high-altitude nuclear test, but it remains in orbit even today. Sixty years later, we are no further from nuclear disarmament, no closer to peace, and although we are all able to communicate with much more efficiency than we could in 1962, we have not used this opportunity to move forward together as a world people. Telstar looks on, dead and dreaming, in a floating ocean of metal, circling the drain of our man-made abyss.\nThis is ON-22/191.\nPatch notes: R-EW Audioholistics (Runoff system) consisting of Wildfire Laboratories Sovereign, Bastl Tea Kick / Noise Square, Doepfer A-196 Phase Locked Loop and Dreadbox Ataxia, generating eight different tuned and held tones. Tea Kick (2x tones) and Noise Square (2x tones) routed into Dreadbox Utopia / attenuated and summed to main out (L). Ataxia in dual LFO mode, with both LFOs driven into audible range and tuned / attenuated and summed via Tiptop MISO to main out (R). Sovereign and PLL tuned / summed via SSDP switch mixer / attenuated and summed again via Tiptop MISO to main out (R). L/R outputs panned and summed via Behringer 305 stereo mixer / routed through Zoom H1 digital recorder / captured via Goldwave. All pitch drift / deviation from the initial chordal profile across the 62-minute runtime is the system itself, not externally directed.",

            "about": "Retreading the worn down path\nEroded by years of traversal\nI cannot remember being here before\nRecalling only a dim light that seems familiar\nRemote and glowing inside this wall of fog\nAnd so I trudge onward\nContinuing down this jagged escarpment\nBreaking apart the further in I walk\nRipped into a landscape of dysfunction\nOpening into some maw deep within the Urth\nThe light is no closer still\nNever coming fully into view\nAlthough I cannot say what I expect to find when I reach it\nI only know that I must crawl\nDragging my mindless body across this gravel waste\nAsking the same unanswered question\nRepeating the same empty plea\n---\nRecorded live February 3, 2020, with only a sub-84hp seed of the modular system I have since developed, in conjunction with other analog studio instruments such as the Arturia Microbrute, the Korg MS-20 and three Moogerfooger units (low pass filter, ring modulator, MIDI MuRF). Passed around for a while as a demo to various labels before being shelved and forgotten about. This session is a unique intersection of early Ziggurat ideas, the Vibratelepathos sessions and my Deep Earth methodologies, forming an island that can be distantly glimpsed from all three points.",

Like 'Grass to Heel', it is less than apparent where the seams are in the loop itself, but there remains a distinct sense of immobility - a landscape of weather experienced from the perspective of a plinth that stands atop a green hill.\nCatalog designate: UR-23/095\nSource sound: Arturia Microfreak, Harmonic oscillator\nImage: Luigi Mayer / Reprocessed by ABM&D",

            "about": "\"The earth, that is sufficient,\nI do not want the constellations any nearer,\nI know they are very well where they are,\nI know they suffice for those who belong to them.\"\n-Walt Whitman, excerpt from \"Song of the Open Road\" (1856)\n---\nThe first attempt at Workingman's Drone session number eighty-three, recorded on the 3rd evening of November, 2024. It felt disconnected from the original purpose, and so it was shelved for later consideration. Following the initial session, which consisted of seven oscillators (see the track information panel for detailed patch notes), the recording was further shaped by the granular resampling and fast Fourier transform processes within Goldwave to become what is put before you now. The visual pairing for this album is my most recent experiment with displacement mapping of my own photography and Frantisek Kupka paintings. The release exists as absolute music in the 18th century definition of that term - music, for music's own sake - and these types of releases are likely to become more proliferated across the next four years, for reasons that should remain obvious.",

Bristling, loud, even a little dissonant, heavy mind-flossing music meant to either calm or obliterate the listener, depending on the dosage...er, decibel level.\nMAXIMUM VOLUME YIELDS MAXIMUM RESULTS!",

            "about": "\"This Cold Foundation will belong to you.\"\n-Kartir, inscription from the inner wall of Bon Khaanak, 3rd century\n---\nInitial session recorded live on 2nd January 2025. Three different Doepfer A-188 delay units receiving frequency modulation from Noise Reap Foundation's sinewave output. All three A-188 units mixed via Future Sound Systems MTX9A 9x9 active pin matrix, and routed to low pass filters in 2HP LPF (1024), Doepfer A-121-3 (512) and Dave Smith Instruments DSM03 (256), before being panned and mixed in Toppobrillo Minimix. Post-proc work across the rest of January included heavy use of low-pass filtering via Arturia's Minifilter as well as multing the original sessions and re-tuning the new iterations with an Image Line ring modulator. Audio Damage's Rat Shack Reverb was used on an auxiliary send, and subsequently these rendered files in GoldWave were further refined with parametric equalization, fast Fourier transforms and panned stereo delays.",

            "about": "Kath watched them argue in the rain from across the street, standing wordless beside his desk in the workshop, dimly illuminated by the pulsing machine beside him. His neighbors were outside so rarely, which made their presence in a downpour even stranger than it already may have been, with their identities reduced to wet-streaked phantoms in his dirty window. Kath always thought the worst of voyeurs, and yet here he was, unable to help himself from watching these blurry black silhouettes in the pissing rain shout and wave their hands at each other. He imagined their voices, although whatever their words may have been remained unknown, buried in the sheets of wet noise.\nKath wondered what they could be arguing about, and why they didn't just go inside their house to fight, when his eye drifted down a little to a rimmed protrusion on the ground next to them. He couldn't tell if it was a small stack of stones or something more detailed than that, but it made him notice that one of the neighbors was slowly edging the other toward it, whatever it was.\nKath held his breath then, without realizing it, as he observed the figure on the left producing what appeared to be a handgun, which was promptly pointed at the opposite figure. The person on the right held their arms up in the air, and slowly leaned down onto their knees. They stopped moving at all for a while, held in thrall, and the gun never deviated from being very close to the prostrated figure, who slowly began to crawl toward the dark shape on the ground.\nKath realized next what the shape must have been, seeing the kneeling figure grappling at something awkwardly and revealing an upright opened hatch, circular like a manhole cover. They held their hands out toward the other who still pointed the gun, perhaps begging, or crying, but slowly shambling over to the hatch anyway. The figure on the left leaned in harder this time, gun prodding toward their begging other, and a moment later Kath could no longer see the person on the right.\nThe now lone neighbor bent down and closed the hatch again, struggling with some aspect of it for a moment, finally standing back up to wipe their arm across their hanging head. They stumbled backward a little, refusing to turn away from the closed hatch on the ground, but continuing to slowly put some distance between them. Kath thought for a second about what could be underneath his neighbor's backyard - how unusual it was to watch someone retreating beneath the ground through a hatch he'd never noticed before, in what he had always imagined was just another plain suburban neighborhood, Kath seemed to think.\nJust as he began to visualize some kind of bunker or hidden complex beneath his street, a tense wave of quick pain went from his hip up through his right ribs, and Kath realized he could no longer see the figure standing outside. The electricity turned off abruptly, going dark simultaneously between the dots of the street lamps and the multicolor glow of his own machine, which now produced a soft whirring sound as something within it powered down. A warm odor permeated the air, which now felt thinner and scratched his throat as he slowly inhaled again.\nKath sat still in the black room, certain only then that something was happening, something he could not see or know, and slowly the feeling came to him that it would be so much worse than he could ever imagine.",

            "about": "\"Upon the curvature of a hill\nGrass to heel, ranges glimpsed\nThe glimmer of a sword like a noonday star\nThat guides the praying hands of a king\"\nThe fourth part of a five-session 'tone poem' that explores the different facets of loop-based composition, 'The Glimmer of a Sword' arrives aptly at a time when the world's sanity and safety seems to hang precariously in the undefined space between so many negative forces. The loop persists, because it cannot do anything else - it is a recursive circle bound to follow a singular path, the only place it has ever been. While we stand in the center of this oscillating whirlpool, we wonder if the next time around might be different? Perhaps change will come, if the tracks beneath us deteriorate? As if in a wordless answer, the loop persists - hope is as facile as vanity, here. The circle remains unbroken, logical and illogical, the oscillation forever complete and incomplete in a superposition of dizzying mindless madness. We too become entranced within it, able to sense its presence even with our eyes closed, held in a gasp between the here and the there, lulled and pacified, unaware or unwilling to acknowledge the true nature of this glimmering line drawn around us, a coiled blade, a sword with no hilt and no terminus, no master to direct it, a decapitant halo.\nCatalog designate: UR-23/176\nSource sound: Behringer 'Blue Marvin' ARP 2600 reiteration\nImage: Luigi Mayer / Reprocessed by ABM&D",

Aptly released following an overnight power outage thanks to the remnants of Hurricane Helene that crawled up to Ohio. Power still flickering as I write this, and my thoughts are with Asheville, the city where we got married in 2004, which is currently underwater despite being in the mountains. We're the lucky ones who only have to throw out all the food in our refrigerator, and I have a terrible feeling that the toll of Helene will not be fully counted for some time. The environment is so irreparably broken now that it seems storms like Helene will only become more frequent, more devastating. As if there was not a bounty of other suffering already proliferated throughout the world in this age, I once again feel compelled to flee inland and hide under the ground.",

            "about": "All creative work is never truly finished. Formats, frames, all arbitrary lines placed carefully around the artist, as a construct designed to organize and commodify the materials generated by the creative mind. In their natural state, these materials are nothing more than evidence of a process in motion, which itself is within another cascading sea of processes. The absolute nature of creative thought is a state of endless and boundless exploration, done in the name of expression for its own sake, a joyous and all-encompassing communion with the forces of the universe, whatever they may be, and it exists outside of time, apart from everything.\nThis so-called act of finishing, of \"turning in\" a complete work, is nothing short of a job, an act of utterly mundane ritual and meaningless definition that still allows plenty of open space for the inscriptions of passersby, themselves allowed to scrawl into it whatever they wish to feel, passive and inert as they sometimes are. Forced contexts and retconned memories. Drawing this line of separation willfully around the creative act is what holds the pleasure of creation hostage - it provides an end to an otherwise continuous river of ideas and impulses, pure and reactive from one to the next, everything given time and space.\nThis is a river that has no beginning or end, it is simply in motion for as long as the artist draws breath, and it is as intricately a part of their ability to live and survive as all of the blood in their bodies. The creative act is everything. The work can never be finished. You lean down at the edge of the river and cup your hands to fill them with the water. As you do, you become aware of the reflections in the surface - every creative act, every idea, every accomplishment, every regret and consideration and revelation of human creativity is there, like a family tree, leading directly to you, to here, to now. All that follows is to simply become a part of it yourself.\nIn this way, the creative act provides an answer for that most basic of human needs - purpose, meaning, belonging. You can only ever be what you are. What may yet take you or I years of our lives to discover, the mouth of the river just laughs at us, and beckons us closer in our realization of what it has been all along.\nThat river carries with it all of the sediments from the river floor, from the water's edge, and the forests and mountains beyond it. Those mountains, an accumulation of this sediment, built only by time and entropy's forward march, which will in turn break them down again to rejoin the river as so much endless particulate. The statue inside the stone remains inside the stone - all the statues and monuments that have ever been built are waiting there, deep inside the rock, the totality of their constitution being nothing more than grains of sediment packed tightly together.\nExcavating those monuments is only our feeble and human attempt to redefine the world as we'd like it to be, not quite realizing that irony creeps up, informing you that you haven't changed anything, you haven't made anything new, that such things are impossible given the grand scale of the natural world. Instead, all of your proposed alterations have been communion with that world, bringing yourself closer to the beautiful chaos that embodies the way of all things. Those reflections in the river's surface echo back to you - no different than a flesh and bone variation of the sediment of eroded mountains and sun-kissed beach sands, gathered up by the wind and the waters. So too are we here, in the creative act, looking in a cosmic mirror at ourselves, in all worlds and times.\nThis release is not a finished release, nor will it ever be. Even when the last piece of recorded sound is appended to it at some unnamed date in the future, it will be declared as incomplete. Any written record that testifies this release is complete will itself be a lie. It is the explicit intent of the artist that this album, and its darker half, both be considered as permanently incomplete.\nN.B. - For more detailed information about each piece, usually including patch notes, explore the \"Track info\" sections of each individual recording. This release will be added to periodically and sporadically throughout the year, and the price of admission will remain the same. The cover design is likely to change as well, and prior generations of this design will be included with this release as bonus downloadable files.\nCatalog #: EST-22/006",

Braids + Rings, 2HP Pluck) sequenced by Quantermain in Ornament & Crime, playing \"Porcupine\" scales with CV source via Euclidean pattern generation. These signals are combined with a Doepfer A-135-2 mixer, reduced to mono, then multed (Behringer 173) and routed into two lowpass filters (Doepfer A-121-3 + 2HP, modulated by two different EGs with differing rates), and sent onward to Strymon Magneto in stereo, whose wet sound is multed and sent to Mutable Inst. Clouds. Magneto also uses a Disting Mk4's mono to stereo reverb (L3) for an auxiliary send, and many aspects of Magneto and Clouds are modulated/triggered via several different LFOs and trigger outputs from Blue Lantern's CMOS Party (Boolean gates) and CuteLab's Missed Opportunities (probabilistic gates). The final result of these two modules' outputs is sent into a Behringer 305 stereo mixer and recorded.",

                    "about": "Exploring a new patch led by 3x probabilistic triggers from CuteLab's Missed Opportunities - the first two sent into Mutable Inst. Rings' line input and strum input, the third sent into Ornament & Crime's Lorenz attractor mode, which leads the sequencing of Rings via the V/oct. Multiple disparate LFOs from Behringer 921/Dreadbox Ataxia+Utopia were sent into a Doepfer A-135-2 where they were also used to modulate each other's voltage envelopes, allowing for \"windows\" of modulation to get through to Rings at different times and in perpetually unique combinations. Rings' stereo signal was then sent into two different lowpass filters (Doepfer A-121-3 + 2HP LPF) for subtle coloring before being further routed into Mutable Inst. Clouds, which was then sent into a Disting Mk4 running E5 (stereo compressor mode).",

All audio minus the LPF outputs was mixed via a Tiptop MISO unit and summed down (alongside the LPF outputs) into a Behringer 305 panning mixer. No effects or additional external modulation were used.",

            "about": "For the final Ziggurat release of 2024, I've final glossed a session from the archives, recorded on 18th June of this year with two sections of combined oscillator voices from the Buchla 281t Quad Function Generator and 258t Dual Oscillator.\nThese voices were summed and routed into the Befaco A*B+C module, which was organized in a dual ring modulator configuration, and the output of this module was sent through Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay system in Shift mode. In post, the recording was multed through Image Lines' Frequency Shifter (also in ring modulation mode), and passed through an auxiliary send path that included two Airwindows processors (Galactic and Srsly 2), with all three signals combined through the Maximus compressor. This final recording was subtly shaped by a 4th order Butterworth low pass filter in GoldWave.\nPrimarily, this session was recorded as a study of the Befaco module acting as a dual ring modulator, since the module is a dual four-quadrant multiplier with a voltage controllable offset, which can also act as a four-channel mixer or a dual VCA. It is one of many such sessions collecting dust on SSDs that bear revisiting if and when the occasion feels correct.",

These pieces were recorded on the 8th and 9th of August, 2024, with subsequent final gloss mastering work being completed today, on the first day of 2025. Notable post-proc includes the inclusion of Universal Audio's Pure Plate reverb on an auxiliary send, receiving audio rate modulation on the pre-delay to generate some unique overtones. Additionally, Arturia filters and GoldWave FFT were employed for the usual purposes.",

            "about": "A combinatorial piece, sourced from two LSZ variations of a Workingman's Drone session from January 3 2022 - overlaid, re-pitched and processed through multiple filters and an Airwindows feedforward reverberation system, using three banks of four delays each in a Householder feedback matrix, with its delay constants being linked to numerical values from the Fibonacci sequence. In total, \"Unspoken Panegyric\" consists of twenty-four oscillators tuned together.\nA continuous stream of gratitude is owed to David Burraston (Noyzelab) for making me aware of the Airwindows DSP development community, which has become a progressively deeper playground for Ziggurat sessions and sonic experimentation in general. I look forward to the day when the Airwindows systems can be migrated into a Eurorack format - maybe they have been already, and I am just not aware. If you know more than I do, let me know.\nVoices (4x of each are used in this recording):\n1. Behringer 1004 / ARP 2500 (Combinatorial waveform, FM feedback)\n2. Buchla 258t oscillator 1 (Sawtooth waveform, FM feedback)\n3. Buchla 258t oscillator 2 (Novel waveform)\n4. Mutable Inst. Braids Syn^ + Kontact gain (Sawtooth waveform)\n5.

The poem was brought to mind as the loops persisted, forming shapes and vistas in my greened mind, despite it being written without a title or a purpose as far back as January 2021. More and more, it feels as if parts of my thinking are only fragments of creative work that cannot make sense until a certain amount of time has passed, awaiting their true contexts, while I ponder them from the outside like dreamt-up secrets, messages from and to someone else, absorbed temporarily in the jumble of my brain by some undefined body capacitance.\nCatalog designate: UR-22/349\nSource sound: Future Sound Systems MTX9A pin matrix (feedback loops)\nImage: Luigi Mayer / Reprocessed by ABM&D",

It is one of an innumerable amount of examples of human technological achievement and scientific progress that are inextricably connected to equally horrific developments in destructive power, with the quiet serenity of this photograph (reproduced here as an album cover) underscored by the sardonic observation that such a momentous event was still secondary to the christening of the atomic bomb.\nCat#: ON-22/297\nSource material: Roland System 100 LFO & 4x Quadrature LFOs (via Ornament & Crime) tuned in the audible frequency range.",

            "about": "Sixteen consecutive test studies, recorded across two evenings, for the Doepfer A-189-1 Voltage Controlled Bit Modifier, with one track exploring each of the machine's sixteen different bit modification modes. Presented as minimally and directly as possible, in the 1:1 publishing tradition of \"Heathen Earth\" and other live audio documents.\nTo illustrate the machine's capabilities, two sinewaves were ring modulated and presented as a dry signal alongside the result of routing the same signal through the VBM. In each track, unique settings were dialed in for both the bit reduction and sample rate reduction, as well as the ratio and tuning of the inharmonic preset voltages in the ring modulator. The output from the VBM was also slightly filtered with a low-pass filter to better blend it with the dry sinewaves.\nAll sixteen sessions were recorded live, direct from the Doepfer A-100 LC-9 case with Goldwave in sixteen-bit near-monophonic audio at a sampling rate of 48000 hertz.",

            "about": "\"Wind Send\" was originally published by the talented Matt Atkins at his Minimal Resource Manipulation imprint in England, on 7th December 2022. It was offered as a digital download and a limited edition CD-R, both of which regretfully included a cover image that was created with so-called artificial intelligence, which has since been revealed to be a massive mistake due to the incredibly problematic nature of these systems.\nInitially, as the true damage of these systems became apparent, in their blatant bypassing of consent and theft of any artist's work that has the misfortune of being collected in a search engine's data set, as well as their needless ecological occupations, I felt it would serve some kind of positive purpose, to keep the conversation open, in leaving my small handful of releases that used these designs available. To make no secret of the fact that myself and several other artists I know all flirted with these systems when they were new, not realizing their true nature until, unfortunately, music had been published using them.\nAfter some time passed, however, it became increasingly apparent to me that this idea was untenable - that I no longer wanted to be associated with these images in any way, did not wish for anyone interacting with these albums without my commentary attached to think that I was endorsing these systems - and I myself could no longer listen to or enjoy these recordings without having the experience polluted by their associations with these images. In this way, the reissue of \"Wind Send\" that you see before you has now at least partially become a protest piece against things like Open AI and all of its clones, and people like Sam Altman and all of his clones.\nFor its position in this, \"Wind Send\" sonically remains ambivalent. I built it out of experimenting with two different field recordings of storms that I recorded with a Zoom H1 microphone sitting in the window of my workshop, routing the sound through the complex veins of my modular system, shaping things with all sorts of arcane modulations and signal processors, all very much influenced by Stockhausen - particularly \"Gesang der Jünglinge,\" which had a profound affect on me when I first discovered it.\nIn the end of the 2024 year, as the publishing anniversary for \"Wind Send\" approached, I was working on another similarly approached piece of music, \"A Chamber for Sifting Vital Nutrients,\" which itself is one of several extended variations of a shorter piece called \"Peeling\" that will appear on an anti-fascism compilation at Humanhood Recordings. With both pieces in mind, the decision was made to finally sit down and re-design the album art for \"Wind Send,\" doing it \"the old fashioned way\" in order to unequivocally refute and disown the mistake I had previously made with the first cover image.\nThis new image visually resembles the shape of the Stanley R. Mickelson Safeguard Complex in North Dakota - a structure that ought to be familiar to listeners by now for its undeniable influence on all Ziggurat visuals, textures, themes and recording sessions. This structure and its distinct shape have both become an unexpected logo for the Limestone Ziggurat project, and considering the purpose of the building's design, as well as its current occupied state after being abandoned by the American government, it feels appropriate to LSZ's outlook for several different reasons. And so I built this symbol using photographed sections of the hardwood floor in my studio, the room where so much of the Ziggurat canon is recorded, and placed it in a surrealistic landscape of reduced bits, essentially recalling the original intent of the first edition's cover image, but this time building it with the human elements completely restored.\nOther revisions have followed this - a Limestone Ziggurat album and a Milieu album issued at Machine Tribe in New York have both been given proper redesigns, as have a small number of albums published here digitally. It has been the right moment to move on from Altman's deceit for a very long time.\nWhile this is all very symbolic as a gesture, I do think it is useful to show and explain, in order to further reinforce the point that I feel is so necessary to make in 2025 - that for my part in the creative conversation, it is more important than perhaps ever before for me to make things \"the hard way,\" using my hands, forcing my brain to learn new processes, programs and machines to more effectively push the boundaries of where my work can possibly exist. In the months and years to come, it will continue to remain crucial to both ask the question and provide the answer, and the progressively increasing time and energy it takes to perform both of those functions will rely entirely on a desire to build things, and not a desire to have the things we wish to imagine in our lives built for us by others.",

                    "about": "Originally published as catalog entry 69 at Minimal Resource Manipulation in England on 7th December, 2022. This first edition was notable for being the very first physically distributed LSZ recording, and also unfortunately went to print with a cover image generated by so-called AI in the early days of LLM fetishism. While this first edition cannot be taken out of circulation, it is the artist's sincere hope that it serves as a talking point against the use of such LLM systems, at least in the state they currently exist, where their engines are put into motion with stolen art, bypassing consent, and harming the ecosystem of the Earth in the process. This original edition of Wind Send is in no way an endorsement of these systems, and their permanent mark on the LSZ catalog is highly regrettable.",
                    "credits": "from Wind Send, released February 2, 2025\nW/P By Brian Grainger. Recorded live at White Pillar, December 25th 2021, using two field recordings captured with a Zoom H1 digital recorder and the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Gratitude to Matt Atkins and Jonathan Deasy for their patience, kindness and consideration.",

In some ways, \"Wythoff Deconstruction\" could be seen as a linear development of the same approach that brought \"Wind Send\" into existence, and as such, is best experienced alongside another input source of your choice - a book, a bath or an open window.\nCat#: GG-24/158",
