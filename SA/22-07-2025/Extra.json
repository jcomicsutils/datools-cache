            "about": "GODO007: 31st March 2023.\nThe humming of summer lawns. Fluttering and strumming from another green world… exactly where “Draw / Orb” takes us – somewhere not quite on this planet, albeit reminiscent of. Sonics are flown in from a place somewhat alien to what we know. We are denizens of a new elsewhere – familiar, yet undiscovered. The birds are twittering, a breeze blows, but the ground is buzzing – there is an electricity in the atmosphere here too. It eventually becomes apparent that the sky is also an aviary for aviation, not just avifauna. Luscious grasses are overwhelmed by glistening chrome whilst the stratosphere seems to draw further away. Have we become subterraneans in this foreign land?\nExtra are Brian Grainger and Howard Stelzer, two stalwarts of ambient, experimental and abstract music. With more than four decades’ worth of experience in recording long-form, slow electronic music between them, their new collaborative venture is a true meeting of minds. GOTO is proud to release “Draw / Orb”, the first fruit of this union, taking us through a rich tapestry of field recordings, gentle acoustics and synthetic atmospheres.\nWhen you just can’t get enough – Extra.",

'Hard/Rainbow,' Extra's second album, was made manifest in the Summer of '22.\nThe band's debut release was 'Draw/Orb' issued at Finlay Shakespeare's GOTO imprint in England, and by the time it was published in March of '23, a flurry of several different Extra albums already surrounded it. With all of those albums currently awaiting publication at various different labels around the globe, the band felt it pertinent to establish a Bandcamp page for themselves, to provide a platform for self-released music and limited physical editions.\nWith the release of 'Hard/Rainbow' the Extra imprint has arrived, with this and all subsequent self-released works being distributed by the non-label 'and so on.'\n'Hard/Rainbow' is the band's sophomore effort, and follows directly the path initiated by 'Draw/Orb' into ever stranger landscapes of surrealist assemblage and synthesized pointillism, a recording made in the long traditions of headphone music and deep listening.\nPlease enjoy, and so on.",

            "about": "Howard Stelzer and Brian Grainger are still Extra. Across 2024 and the first couple months of 2025, Extra completed two separate (but connected) albums: 'Imperial/Sieving' and 'Sieving/Other' - this being the former, with the latter due out later in the year at Rural Isolation Project.\n'Imperial/Sieving' consists of a more atmospheric side of the band, focusing more on looming passages of droning chords and subtle stages of processing, re-processing and so on. Not initially intended to be its own album, it grew from the iterative conversation that produced the more varied 'Sieving/Other,' and could be approached as a branching path from within the dense forestry of that soundworld. Or not.\nAs ever, Extra offers you a deep listening experience of sound that has been built carefully and considerately, an accumulation of textures, temperatures and vibrating moments held in the air, from the hands and minds of two men and their strange machines.",

Extra sculpts sensuous, vivid drone music out of steamrolled cassette tapes, mountains of modular synthesizers and repurposed suburban ephemera. Their latest missive is a deeply serene time-defying expanse wherein it is possible for all participants to find themselves hovering several feet above safe ground. And so on.”\nLtd. edition of 60 CD-Rs available at Chocolate Monk, UK:  chocolatemonk.co.uk/available.html",
