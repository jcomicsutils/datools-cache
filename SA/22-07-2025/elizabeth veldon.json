(slam!)\nLast night I saw upon the stair\nA little man who wasn’t there\nHe wasn’t there again today\nOh, how I wish he’d go away...",

            "about": "when i was a child i was barely brought up in scotland; my family and the community we belonged to held onto their irish catholic roots as a bulwark against the systems of oppression that had brought their own grand parents from ireland in the first place.\nthe debate happening just now in scotland about the definition of what being scottish is does not recognise the experience of immigrants and migrant workers who's children are born and brought up in scotland but at one remove from their home nation and, as such, is inherently racist and xenophobic.\ni can not (nor would i wish to) speak for other communities in scotland (travellers, the roma, asian-scotish, scottish jewish people) but i can speak for the community i was brought up in.\nthis is my contribution to (and problematisation) of the debate about nationhood.",

Behind, the long defile,\nThe steep rock-path, alongside which, from under\nSnow-caves, sharp-corniced, tumble the ice-cold waters.\nAnd now, here, at the corrie’s summit, no peak,\nNo vision of the blue world, far, unattainable,\nBut this grey plateau, rock-strewn, vast, silent,\nThe dark loch, the toiling crags, the snow;\nA mountain shut within itself, yet a world,\nImmensity. So may the mind achieve,\nToiling, no vision of the infinite,\nBut a vast, dark and inscrutable sense\nOf its own terror, its own glory and power.\nNan Shepherd",

It feels like you’re trapped in a particularly tense David Lynch scene, with the surrealism building as the hours rack up. Best listened to very loud, as your heartbeat starts to fully sync up with the subtle shapeshifting electronic pulses.'\nmookidmusic.com/2019/01/02/hibernate-with-elizabeth-veldons-16-hour-minimal-drone-piece-a-night-in-winter/",

            "about": "'Cassini spacecraft captured this rare look at Earth and its moon from Saturn orbit on July 19, 2013. Taken while performing a large wide-angle mosaic of the entire Saturn ring system, narrow-angle camera images were deliberately inserted into the sequence in order to image Earth and its moon. This is the second time that Cassini has imaged Earth from within Saturn’s shadow, and only the third time ever that our planet has been imaged from the outer solar system.\nEarth is the blue point of light on the left; the moon is fainter, white, and on the right. Both are seen here through the faint, diffuse E ring of Saturn. Earth was brighter than the estimated brightness used to calculate the narrow-angle camera exposure times. Hence, information derived from the wide-angle camera images was used to process this color composite. '\nwww.ciclops.org/view/7695/One_Special_Day_in_the_Life_of_Planet_Earth?js=1",

            "about": "this was suggested by june tabor's singing of 'the plains of waterloo'\nAs I rode out one fine summer's morning\nDown by the gay banks of a clear pearling stream,\nThere I spied a handsome fair maid making sad lamentations,\nOh, I threw myself in ambush to hear her sad strains.\nThrough the woods she marched along, caused the valleys to ring-o,\nThe fine feathered songsters around her they flew,\nSaying, “The wars they are all over and peace it is restored again,\nBut yet my Willie's not returning from the plains of Waterloo.”\nWell, I stepped up to this fair maid and said, “My fond creature,\nOh, may I make so bold as to ask your true love's name?\nFor it's I've been in battle where the cannons around rattle\nAnd by some strange fortune I might have known the same.”\n“Willie Smith me true love's name is, hero of great fame,\nHe's gone and he's left me in sorrow, it's true.\nNo-one shall me enjoy but me own darling boy,\nBut yet he's not returning from the plains of Waterloo.”\n“Well, if Willie Smith's your true love's name, he's a hero of great fame,\nHe and I have been in battle through many's the long campaign.\nThrough Italy and Russia, through Germany and Prussia,\nOh, he was me loyal comrade through France and through Spain.”\n“Until at length by the French we were surrounded,\nLike the heroes of old we did them subdue.\nWe did fight for three days until we did defeat him,\nThat brave Napoleon Boney on the plains of Waterloo.”\n“Now the eighteenth day of June, it is end of that battle,\nLeaving many's the bold hero to sigh and to mourn.\nOh, the war drums they did beat and the cannons around did rattle,\nIt was by a French soldier your Willie he was slain.”\n“And as I passed by there where he lay a-bleeding,\nOh, I scarcely had time for to bid him adieu.\nIn a faltering voice these words he was repeating,\nFare the well, me lovely Annie, you are far from Waterloo.“\nNow when this lovely fair maid heard this sad acclamation\nOh, but her rosy cheeks turned pale and wan.\nAnd when I saw this fair maid making sad lamentations,\nOh, I said, “Me lovely Annie, I am that very one.”\n“And here is the ring that was broken between us,\nIn the midst of all danger, love, to remind me of you.”\nAnd when she saw the token, she fell into me arms crying,\n“You're welcome, dearest Willie, from the plains of Waterloo.”",

            "about": "'Veldon allows pure electronic tones to corrode, morph, or collapse altogether. Hearing the change is like trying to notice the growth in a sequoia from one second to the next. This 30-minute piano piece has a similar ethos. Veldon hunts and pecks through a stunted melody, pauses, and eventually resumes. Will it ever evolve or resolve? She simply returns to it, the dynamics shifting slightly as the tape hiss trickles past like the sound of a distant stream. You hang on every repeated phrase and wait for some revelation, only to disappear alongside Veldon in the end.'\ndaily.bandcamp.com/lists/music-designed-to-help-you-sleep",

            "about": "this piece came about after discussing a paper with alex temple which discussed trans embodiment in music. we both felt that the paper had multiple issues and this is a reductio ad absurdum regarding one of them.\nif a jokes worth making once it's worth making 23 times\nso i didn't explain the joke and, in retrospect, that's not funny.\nthe paper made repeated snipes at post-structuralism but set up multiple binary oppositions which had barley surpassed value judgements attached to this. in this album i wanted to show how rediculious this approach is. even the title is itself a binary opposition but one that has had it's terms reversed and to understand why that's a thing you're going to have to read some french stuff.",

            "about": "this album references the m r james story 'the ash tree'\n\"So much is to be said of the Symptoms seen on the Corpse. As to what I am to add, it is meerly my own Experiment, and to be left to Posterity to judge whether there be anything of Value therein. There was on the Table by the Beddside a Bible of the small size, in which my Friend punctuall as in Matters of less Moment, so in this more weighty one — used nightly, and upon his First Rising, to read a sett Portion. And I taking it up — not without a Tear duly paid to him which from the Study of this, poorer Adumbration was now pass'd to the contemplation of its great Originall — it came into my Thoughts, as at such moments of Helplessness we are prone to catch at any the least Glimmer that makes promise of Light, to make trial of that old and by many accounted Superstitious Practice of drawing the Sortes: of which a Princapall Instance, in the case of his late Sacred Majesty the Blessed Martyr King Charles and my Lord Falkland, was now much talked of. I must needs admit that by my Trial not much Assistance was afforded me: yet, as the Cause and Origin of these Dreadful Events may hereafter be search'd out, I set down the Results, in the case it may be found that they pointed the true Quarter of the Mischief to a quicker Intelligence than my own.\n\"I made, then, three trials, opening, the Book and placing my Finger upon certain words: which gave in the first these words, from Luke xiii. 7, Cut it down; in the second, Isaiah xiii. 20, It shall never be inhabited; and upon the third Experiment; Job xxxix. 30, Her young ones also suck up blood.\"",

            "about": "I've been intending to write this piece for some time. It refers to newspaper stories about ariana grande suffering from depression.\nto often we celebrate male artists being open regarding their mental health but when women speak about the same issues they are attacked for discussing their emotional life beyond conventional norms.\n'Veldon’s groaning cycles of metallic phase are as impenetrable as they are edgeless, seeping out to fill all available space. The smothering vapour is a great analogue for the disempowering fog of mental illness, its unchanging carapace also (paradoxically) evoking an austerity regime that brooks no debate as it dismembers mental health support services. As Veldon knows, Ariana Grande isn’t alone in her desperation.'\nweneednoswords.wordpress.com/2019/05/08/elizabeth-veldon-for-ariana-grande-in-recognition-of-her-desperation/",

            "about": "charlie was a captive elephant (the then largest in captivity) who lived with his keeper and companion ibrahim at craigend zoo near milngavie.\nwhen the zoo closed down in 1955 they moved to the butlins in ayr and then on to yorkshire where charlie became distraught and, eventually, violent after the death of ibrahim and was put down in 1961\ni like to imagine that charley and ibrahim where at their happiest in craigend and their relationship shows that humans and other animals can have friendships which are deep and meaningful but, in the end, charlie's story was tragic. charlie belonged in the wild, not in captivity.\n'work with animals is a source of suffering to all of us. we treat them like babies who cannot speak'\noleg gazenko\nwww.milngavieherald.co.uk/news/local-headlines/the-elephant-we-ll-never-forget-1-213554\nmurderiseverywhere.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/the-greatness-of-nation-can-be-judged.html\n'The opening track is not what I expected – most people associate elizabeth with long form, minimalist drone. This opening track, “charlie and ibrahim are walking in milngavie and a band is playing”, is a piano piece. And, a beautiful piano piece at that. Abstract and verging on Dada – I believe – but very on point and sentient. The opening track sets the emotion encumbered with such an album. The second track is a nostalgic look at fun times in the distant past. Almost the memory of a dream is evoked through the use of sparse timing and playful, water-like strokes of the keys.\nHowever, it is the impossibly long titled final track (“we raised a tomb for charlie and ibrahim so they may lie together as they did in mugdock and know the joy of companionship until all things pass. and that we may know this also”) that steals the show. As the title of the track concludes, it is not a rag-time show stopper. This lament on a piano is a sparsely populated, almost silent track.'\nwww.theparishnews.com/2016/09/elizabeth-veldon-for-charlie-and-ibrahim-that-they-lie-in-the-same-grave/",

            "about": "this album was originally conceived as a score for performance on the 1905 lewis organ at glasgow university but was never realised.\nin the light of the recent refugee crisis my interest in the psalms has shifted from themes of exile and cultural estrangement towards echoing the unimaginable suffering of these refugees.\nthis is the worst crisis since the end of world war two and we must not turn away from those who need our help.\ni do not intend to raise money from this release or tell you where to give or how to give your time; i ask you to look on those in pain and see others like yourself, like those you love.\nthe selection ends with a setting of the first words of psalm 130. i leave you with wyatt's translation of that psalm:\nFROM depth of sin, and from a deep despair,\nFrom depth of death, from depth of heart’s sorrow,\nFrom this deep cave, of darkness deep repair,\nThee have I called, O Lord, to be my borrow.\nThou in my voice, O Lord, perceive and hear\nMy heart, my hope, my plaint, my overthrow,\nMy will to rise: and let by grant appear,\nThat to my voice thine ears do well attend;\nNo place so far, that to Thee is not near;\nNo depth so deep, that thou ne mayst extend\nThine ear thereto; hear then my woful plaint:\nFor, Lord, if thou observe what men offend,\nAnd put thy native mercy in restraint;\nIf just exaction demand recompense;\nWho may endure, O Lord? who shall not faint\nAt such accompt? so dread, not reverence\nShould reign at large. But thou seekest rather love\nFor in thy hand is Mercy’s residence;\nBy hope whereof Thou dost our hearts eke move.\nI in the Lord have set my confidence:\nMy soul such trust doth evermore approve:\nThy holy word of eterne excellence,\nThy mercy’s promise, that is alway just,\nHave been my stay, my pillar, and defence.\nMy soul in God hath more desirous trust,\nThan hath the watchman looking for the day,\nFor his relief, to quench of sleep the thrust.\nLet Israel trust unto the Lord alway;\nFor grace and favour are his property:\nPlenteous ransom shall come with him, I say,\nAnd shall redeem all our iniquity.",

            "about": "' ‘Laika and other works’ is a gathering of releases by Elizabeth Veldon – comprised of two and a half hours’ worth of piano compositions, drone recitals and spoken word monologues, the set includes the complete sets ‘Laika’ and ‘Milton Road to Nepal (For Ghoti)’ as well as ”The Scottish Fisheries’, ‘Darwin Cut Ups for Hobart’, ‘We Will Never Leave You’ and a brand-new companion piece to ‘Laika’. Really is a most intimate reading, which for now our ears have locked upon the chamber tones of ‘over the water’ which across its ten minute stay is awash in all manner of treated piano motifs and strangely abrupt metering, itself veering between moments of genteel passiveness to the turbulent eruptions which in some way, I’m minded to say, perfectly mirror and compliment the whole solemn, remote and reflectively melancholy nature of the water / sea in so much that beneath the tranquility a confused emotion rages beneath the calming surface ripples.'\nmarklosingtoday.wordpress.com/2017/09/06/elizabeth-veldon/\n'Laika and Other Works ’is a collection of drone based pieces, short piano improvisations and spoken word cuts that showcases both the diversity and quality of Veldon’s discography. It’s all very good, basically, although the two ‘Laika’ tracks (originally released in 2015) are the highlight for me, their slices of gravely, phasing drone coming on appropriately cosmic and ominous. On ‘Like Babies Who Cannot Speak’ a recurring metronomic pulse adds an extra element of tension, as if a squad of militant woodpeckers had taken over mission control.\nThat things never descend into retro-hipster-kitsch (Russians! dogs! Space! Communism!) is due partly to ‘Work With Animals’, a new spoken word piece. Veldon recites then loops a quote from Oleg Georgivitch Gazenko, part of the Sputnik 2team responsible for Laika’s mission: “Work with animals is a source of suffering for all of us. We treat them like babies who cannot speak. The more time passes, the more I’m sorry about it….We did not learn enough from the mission to justify the death of the dog.”\nThe four sentences get more fragmented with each repetition, descending finally into a kind of heartbreaking digital gibberish. It’s short but powerful and shifts ‘Laika & Other Works’ from being a historical curio to a lament for the forgotten victims of the space race and a despairing castigation of the ways we treat those species with which we share a planet.'\nradiofreemidwich.wordpress.com/tag/elizabeth-veldon/",

            "about": "this album is based upon virginia woolf's diaries from the time that she wrote 'between the acts' and deal with her fears of invasion\nthe first track is based upon her feelings at being asked to 'represent' t.s. elliot at the funeral of ottoline morell:\n'i must read roger: & go to ott's memorial service, representing also t. s. elliot at his absurd command'\nthe fourth track takes it's title from h.d.'s 'trilogy,' one of the two great poetical works dealing with the effect of total war on a civilian population. while 'between the acts' specifically references elliot's 'four quartets' throughout the work i choose this other work to balance elliot's 'absurd command'\nthe other tracks deal with specific passages from her diaries, including her writing of her fears of the effect of invasion on her as a british jew (her and her husband planned to kill themselves should this happen) while the final track takes the final words of the novel.\ni have taken some time to release this album as i felt it could be crass to discuss a jewish woman's fear of invasion during world war two and the third track is one i was very hesitant to give a title to.\nthis album, given it's subject matter, will be a 'pay what you like' release.\nany parallels with the present situation in the world have to be found by the listener, i am not here to dictate your reaction.",

            "about": "This album was inspired by photographs taken by the film maker, artist and sound artist Chris Dooks. the photographs where of graffiti in a barn dating from the inter-war period. 'can you do the foxtrot,' 'oh horsie...' and 'there's a kiss in store...' take their titles from the graffiti itself. the cover for this album features one of chris dooks photographs.\n'It makes a perfect soundtrack to staring at the world outside a window, to penning a letter to someone special, to thinking about your place in history, to rummaging through old personal affects / artifacts, and letting the ever-present world of fantasy permeate your reality in a moment of quietude and private reflection. It would make for a brilliant accompaniment to an art film. As it evolves, it seems to fade into a light grey vortex. Barely audible bass undulates below.'\nyeahiknowitsucks.wordpress.com/2014/02/06/elizabeth-veldon-glen-tanar-none/",

            "about": "this album is one of the two works under my short lived harsh noise wall project 'green shadow' which have, by different paths, been unavailable for some time.\nthis album was originally published on 'red venice records' but deleted along with my other work on that label as the label owner began to flirt with fascist ideology.\nit briefly became available on my own bandcamp along with another album from the same label. this album was deleted because i was unhappy that the second album had been uploaded in mono rather than stereo (even though it was recorded in stereo) and i disliked the sound quality.\nthis is the final incarnation of this album.",

            "about": "this album revisits the incomplete christine the astonishing work and allows a sort of closure on something that was rather abruptly abandoned.\nthe title comes from the first line of the anglo saxon poem 'the wife's lament.'\nI make this song of myself, deeply sorrowing,\nmy own life’s journey. I am able to tell\nall the hardships I’ve suffered since I grew up,\nbut new or old, never worse than now –\never I suffer the torment of my exile.\narts.uwaterloo.ca/~rtierney/TheWifesLament.pdf",

            "about": "'jenny' is a far more illusive character than the gorbals vampire and is often mentioned as part of the cultural mix that led to her more famous offspring but she deserves attention on her own.\njenny wi- the iron teeth dates from the late 19th and early 20th century when it was believed a monster haunted glasgow green and lived in a shed owned by two elderly women (possibly called 'Allen' one of whom had substandard dental work carried out leaving iron fillings in her teeth clearly visible.\nincluded with the download is a fairly famous poem about this urban legend\nthe cover features the engraving '“Glasgow from the Green”, 1828' by E. Francis, taken from a drawing by W. Westfall\nthis is the second of four halloween albums",

            "about": "The album \"Lowland Islands. 1 (Greater Cumbrea)\" is a sonic interpretation of the islands in the Clyde river estuary, Scotland. Building on a prolific back-catalogue, elizabeth Veldon utilises structured harmonics, minimalist drones and alternating scales to represent Kilchatten Bay & Fintray Bay on the west coast of Scotland.\nThese drones express an isolation from the mainland, a barrenness and also the fragility of being a passing soul through a timeless landscape. There is a bleak sense of otherwordliness when you listen to these drones - almost alienation.\nAt ease with her equipment, she deftly employed the use of physical, analogue technologies and software instruments to build this minimalist composition in to a timeless reminder that we are but fleeting effigies.\nelizabeth Veldon is a sound artist working primarily in the areas of long form drone, minimalism and improvisation.\nThis is the first album in a three-part series that explores the artist's relationship with isolated areas - figuratively and literally.",

            "about": "this album was written for a friend who found they couldn't write when they where ill and has sat, waiting to be edited into a publishable format, for over a month.\nSince then there has been a sudden change in the law in the uk which makes life intensely more difficult for trans people like myself and the person this album was written for. This change has stripped trans people of many of the rights they have enjoyed for fifteen years or more and will be tested legally by the good law project who are building a legal fund to fight it.\nThis album is a fund raiser for that and will be met with further fun raisers for trans orgs in the coming week or two.\nIf you can't afford the £5 then donate what you can to the good law project, provide me with a screenshot and I'll send you a download code.\nAll money from this will go to fund legal action.\nlex iniusta non est lex (an unjust law is no law at all)",

            "about": "this album concerns itself with the medieval fragment 'westron wynd.'\nthese four lines inspired three tudor masses and have resonated down the years to our own time where they still provide inspiration for writers and musicians.\nin this album i have taken two themes and two elements of the poem and constructed two hour pieces for both. these represent (on one level) four of the five elements of 'the english mass' and the four parts of the mass set by the earliest use of this poem in a mass setting in tallis' 'Mass: Western Wynd.'\nthe final section of the mass will be realised, should the opportunity arise, be creating a four channel installation from this in a building of suitable antiquity. the final part of the mass and the cantus firmus (that is the key text) of this final realisation would be an emergent property of the installation and the experience of the individual experiencing it.\nthis, however, is not only an abstract mass setting but is also an exploration of the poem and medieval symbolic systems that allowed multiple readings of a (not always religious) text to coexist and inform each other. in this instance this can be seen as being an exploration of a poem, an abstract mass setting and an exploration of the religious meaning often given to secular works in the medieval world (here the loneliness of the speaker would be seen as symbolising the desire of the soul to be unified with god in heaven.)\nthis is just the first form of this piece and i hope to be able to complete it with a staging in the fairly near future.\nWestron wynd, when wylle thow blow,\nThe smalle rayne down can rayne?\nCryst, yf my love were in my Armys\nAnd I yn my bed a gayne!\nThis piece has necessitated a little research and the books and other media i have used are as follows:\nFerguson, Salter and Stallworthy (ed) 'The Norton Anthology of Poetry.'

            "about": "this is a piano improvisation for holocaust remembrance day based on henry the 8th's 'o my hart'\nO my hart and O my hart!\nMy hart it is so sore,\nSens I must nedys from my love depart\nAnd know no cunse wherefore.\nthis piece utilises a technique for scoring for the piano where i choose a key at random to act as a 'home' key then take this as representing the letter 'a.' each subsequent letter i wish to transcribe (in this case 'o my hart') is taken from this point where each key moving right from this point represents another letter in the sequence of the alphabet (1=a, 2=b...) These notes then form the basis of an improvisation. in this piece additional notes are introduced in each movement to pull the composition further to the right of the keyboard, and to produce a deeper, richer texture. the symbolic nature of this i allow you to decide.\nfor this piece i used a software piano and controller as my piano is in storage.",

Housman\nthe cover is a section of the antonine wall",

And here with pride\n'Their name liveth for evermore' the Gateway claims.\nWas ever an immolation so belied\nAs these intolerably nameless names?\nWell might the Dead who struggled in the slime\nRise and deride this sepulchre of crime.",

            "about": "this album came about through an interaction with the composer Alex Temple on language that had passed out of common usage in the trans community.\nthis led me to think about my own experience in the light of justice epistemology.\nThaky you to Alex for her often though provoking contributions to my life.\nthe text of the facebook post explaining this is included here:\nRecently, in conversation with Alex Temple, i was talking about being an elder in the trans community. More truthfully i was realising that in speaking about ‘older trans folks’ when i ‘transitioned’ had led me to realise that i was now one of those older trans folks.\nThis has led me to ask quite a few questions of myself and my relationship to younger trans folks and ask if i am as eager to force them into a relationship with their bodies and identities which matches my own. I hope i am not and that i do not do this and can find no real trace of this in my actions but there is a kink in this and it is that there are aspects of the experience of younger trans folks, particularly trans femmes, which i find it difficult to share.\nI find, among the community, a less fraught relationship to the body and to sex than my generation had. This has led me to question my own experience of dysphoria and my relationship to my pre-surgical body.\nThe field of social epistemology studies the ways in which knowledge and ways of knowing are formed within groups and i have been thinking about this in relation to how we (we being my generation of trans people) experienced dysphoria and experienced our bodies. To what extent was our experience, our way of knowing our own transness, shaped by group experience and by testimonial injustice towards those who had a different experience?\nTestimonial injustice is a form of epistemological injustice whereby we do not give weight to the testimony of those who fall outside our own epistemological group or world view. Though we sought to bring all views within our activism where we suffering the same lack of understanding which (to use a classic case of testimonial injustice) the academy suffered in regards to both feminism and black studies? Where we essentially unable to spot our own epistemology bias and am i only now becoming aware of my own?\nDid we make others suffer Hermeneutical injustice (a form of epistemological injustice where the degree of injustice is so great that existing becomes impossible and epistemologies are killed before they are even born - where people are killed) and did we cause ourselves to suffer Hermeneutical injustice?\nI know how i felt about my pre-surgical body and l do not regret surgery but would that have been different with a different epistemology? Would that have been different if I was ‘transitioning’ now?\nAdditionally I have added a blog post discussing the murder of Brianna Ghey which I think is relevent to this, it is part of the download.",

            "about": "this is the final part of a trilogy of works based around the great anglican hymn 'abide with me'\nthis began as a single piece but i couldn't leave the song alone until i had worked at it for a few days.\ni have always taken great comfort from this song and i believe that it's fine words transcend religious belief itself and touch something truly human in us all\nAbide with me; fast falls the eventide;\nThe darkness deepens; Lord with me abide.\nWhen other helpers fail and comforts flee,\nHelp of the helpless, O abide with me.\nSwift to its close ebbs out life's little day;\nEarth's joys grow dim; its glories pass away;\nChange and decay in all around I see;\nO Thou who changest not, abide with me.\nNot a brief glance I beg, a passing word,\nBut as Thou dwell'st with Thy disciples, Lord,\nFamiliar, condescending, patient, free.\nCome not to sojourn, but abide with me.\nThou on my head in early youth didst smile,\nAnd though rebellious and perverse meanwhile,\nThou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee.\nOn to the close, O Lord, abide with me.\nI need Thy presence every passing hour.\nWhat but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?\nWho, like Thyself, my guide and stay can be?\nThrough cloud and sunshine, Lord, abide with me.\nI fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;\nIlls have no weight, and tears no bitterness.\nWhere is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?\nI triumph still, if Thou abide with me.\nHold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes;\nShine through the gloom and point me to the skies.\nHeaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;\nIn life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.\nwords: henry francis lyte",

I hear\nThe strain of strutting chanticleer\nCry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.\nFull fathom five thy father lies;\nOf his bones are coral made;\nThose are pearls that were his eyes:\nNothing of him that doth fade,\nBut doth suffer a sea-change\nInto something rich and strange.\nSea-nymphs hourly ring his knell:\nDing-dong.\nHark! now I hear them—Ding-dong, bell.",

            "about": "in his classic album 'the new possibility' john fahey references the work of the theologian paul tillich and the idea of reawakening 'the new possibility' opend up by the story of christ's birth in luke's gospel: 'The birth of this New Possibility,' he writes, 'has nothing to do with Christmas trees, presents, Santa Claus, and little to do with superstitious thoughts regarding virgin births, astrologers, bodily ascensions of virgins, etc. The New Possibility is rather the gift of reconciliation between God and man. He is for all men at all times and places.'\nthis strikes me whenever i hear over the top renditions of the carol 'in the bleak midwinter' (words by christinia rossetti) which is about the transformative and redemptive power of giving, of forsaking that which we have for others and the importance of even the smallest, lest ostentatious gift.\nthis album seeks to reclaim the spiritual importance of the act of giving (either gifts or one's whole self) to others from the commercialisation of this most important and human of acts.\nin a way this is a secular realisation of fahey's 'new possibility' - not of a connection with go but with each other.\ngive because in giving we grow and, as fahey said in the sleeve notes to the new possibility 'Nevertheless, let us do celebrate and rejoice (in proper fashion) the New Possibility; and let us do so with music among other things.'",

            "about": "the bbc doomsday project was a computerised survey of the nation undertaken to celebrate the 900th anniversary of the doomsday book\nit was published on two laser disks with a graphical interface designed specificity for the project which has been replicated across multiple modern it packages.\nsadly it now faces digital obsolescence as it only ran on one acorn computer and those are now rare. in addition copyright law has made the duplication of much of the content impossible as the project opened up content production to individuals rather than experts (another aspect of this project which has become the norm since) and the resultant need to get copyright clearance has rendered this vital and important historical document unacceptable to most people.\nthe first track's title comes from an entry for the area i live in now and the second one is based upon several entries for the area i grew up in.\nthe cover comes from a still image taken from the second 'community' disc.",

            "about": "'summer walkers' is a term given to indigenous highland travellers and this track came about after being told about one which slept each year in the woods near the home of someone i know\n'Elizabeth Veldon’s ‘Songs For The Summer Walker In The Woods‘ has for nearly half of its 30 minute duration a gulf of silence before sparse clusters and single ringing piano notes amble into view. Occasionally more violentally struck gestures occur. An autumnal, chilly, still atmosphere pervades its length. Silence is a crucial component, the gaps between sounds over a track this long cause the listener to cling to the short periods of subtle instrumental work. ‘Songs For The Summer Walker In The Woods’ is a work of patience and calm with plenty of space for thought and reflection of your own. The music becomes at times a soft, welcome intrusion; dead leaves falling gracefully from a skeletal canopy.'\nearsforeyes.co.uk/2017/09/08/music-from-the-woods-elizabeth-veldon-eastville-evp-jorge-boehringer-ailbhe-nic-oireachtaigh-queef-three-eyed-makara/",

            "about": "this album was suggested by reading 'the flower of paradise' by david j. rothenberg\nthe first track is based upon the plain song ave maris stella and the later 'hail queen of heaven, the ocean star' by John Lingard (1771–1851) which was a part of my own upbringing and training in the local choir.\nthe third track is based on a 13th century anthon (first vespers, parBN Lat. 15182, fol. 304)\nthe use of discord throughout the three pieces owes much to marina warner's 'alone of all her sex: the myth and cult of the virgin mary' which discusses the use of the image of mary and the marian cult as a way of instilling behavioural patterns in catholic girls.\nthe cover image is of agnes sorel represented as the enthroned virgin by jean fouquet (c. 1450)",

            "about": "if I when my wife is sleeping\nand the baby and Kathleen\nare sleeping\nand the sun is a flame-white disc\nin silken mists\nabove shining trees,—\nif I in my north room\ndance naked, grotesquely\nbefore my mirror\nwaving my shirt round my head\nand singing softly to myself:\n“I am lonely, lonely.\nI was born to be lonely,\nI am best so!”\nIf I admire my arms, my face,\nmy shoulders, flanks, buttocks\nagainst the yellow drawn shades,—\nWho shall say I am not\nthe happy genius of my household?\nwilliam carlos williams\n'Twenty minutes of it, a time period that anyone in need for some fine minimal ambient drone material would be very happy and pleased to find within their ears. The tone that the artist is giving its attention too is ringing like some kind of magic, a vibrant minimalism that felt to me like it’s a morning time that never ends. As if Elizabeth Veldon had captured the morning glory, cultivated it with her experimental ways and managed to repeat this favorable feeling of sound until the very end.\nIt made my ears twinkle from delight, sparkling in it’s hypnotic relaxing ways. I couldn’t tell if it was moving, or if it was stable; but I could definitely tell that I was enjoying it very much. This serene serenity audio-wise simply had something lovely over it, as if an angel had stopped time and space & kept it ‘pause’ at the very best moment of moments.\nWhen out of the blue & completely unexpected some sentimental piano notes appeared I was in a full state of pure bliss. Elizabeth Veldon had not only captivated the music of the perfect moment in time, she also cultivated it into something much more beautiful than it already was. Surreal, serene and in all honesty; pretty beautiful.'\nyeahiknowitsucks.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/elizabeth-veldon-ten-shaker-dances-for-mother-ann-lee-and-christian-that-he-may-dance-group-3/",

The isle is full of noises,\nSounds, and sweet airs, that give delight, and hurt not.\nSometimes a thousand twangling instruments\nWill hum about mine ears, and sometime voices,\nThat if I then had waked after long sleep\nWill make me sleep again; and then in dreaming\nThe clouds methought would open and show riches\nReady to drop upon me, that when I waked\nI cried to dream again.\nI'm sorry there has been such a long time between releases: between moving house, starting my teacher training and recently beginning my first placement i've simply not had any time (added to this was the fact that I didn't have broadband)\nI recently helped teach act 2, scene 2 of the tempest to a class and i was reminded of the beautiful poetry of caliban's lines\nimages taken from orlando's performance in jarman's adaptation of the tempest",

            "about": "recently the writer Suzanne Moore left the Guardian because hundreds of staff members wrote a letter questioning the tone the newspaper had taken on trans rights and pointing out that several trans women had resigned from the newspaper.\nthey pointed out that the newspaper was a toxic workplace and this, it seems, was too much for Suzanne Moore who resigned and wrote a piece claiming she was victimised by a letter which did not mention her by name. in this piece she spoke about the 'Body Of A Brazilian Transexual' incident from several years ago and openly lied about what happened.\nat the time i responded to this by turning my now defunct label 'black circle records' over to trans voices under the sub series 'black circle gender fuck.' this release collects the work i produced regarding this incident. some of this is still available, some of it has been long out of print but it is all presented in an unedited format, exactly how it was released.\ni have supplied the transcript of a twitter thread i wrote detailing her lies as part of the download as well as pictures of the physical releases for these items. i do not own many of these any longer as they have been archived by the british library and, as such, will outlive Moore's career.\nthis is part of a desire to archive and make available queer histories and to make visible and audible the invisible and silent. this does not represent my work as it stands now but this must not be forgoten.",

It appears as a minimalist tone cluster on the surface but across 30 minutes of close listening, the sound gradually shifts and modulates, much like the titular clouds. The ear notices a series of long droning notes climbing over each other mixed with a faster Doppler effect, like a giant Leslie speaker cabinet spinning ethereal messages to all.

'the clatter' was a glowing orb that emerged from the tunnel walls, filling the entire tunnel with the sound of crashing metal. it is said that faces of the dead could be saw inside the fog, twisted in pain.\nthough there have been no reported sightings of the entity since 1897 the underground has caused concern with it's noise levels particularly for workers.",

            "about": "this album came about after the fire at notre dame and asks us to consider where 'the house of god' is situated.\nthe cover combines images of notre dame and the greenfell tower to create a single 'house of god.'\nmuch of my thoughts on this are expressed in McCaig's 'Assisi'\nThe dwarf with his hands on backwards\nsat, slumped like a half-filled sack\non tiny twisted legs from which\nsawdust might run,\noutside the three tiers of churches built\nin honour of St Francis, brother\nof the poor, talker with birds, over whom\nhe had the advantage\nof not being dead yet.\nA priest explained\nhow clever it was of Giotto\nto make his frescoes tell stories\nthat would reveal to the illiterate the goodness\nof God and the suffering\nof His Son. I understood\nthe explanation and\nthe cleverness.\nA rush of tourists, clucking contentedly,\nfluttered after him as he scattered\nthe grain of the Word. It was they who had passed\nthe ruined temple outside, whose eyes\nwept pus, whose back was higher\nthan his head, whose lopsided mouth\nsaid Grazie in a voice as sweet\nas a child’s when she speaks to her mother\nor a bird’s when it spoke\nto St Francis.\nI have made this album free, i trust you will decide what the value two hours of music is worth to you and that you can donate this to whatever you consider a worthwhile cost.",

I hope they don’t but I think the electorate will just swallow what they’re told and scares the shit out of me.\nmy pieces where recorded long before the election where called and relate to my experience of negotiating online spaces as a queer person. it was tempting to change the titles to reflect the political situation we are in but, well, fascism takes many forms and the gross disrespect of other's lived experiences may well be one.\nthere's still tim to register for the coming election if you live in the uk:  www.gov.uk/register-to-vote",

            "about": "the horrors of the holocaust can often leave us with a feeling of profound nihilism, an all-­‐encompassing hopelessness in the face of inhumanity.\nIn opposition to this stands the lonely figure of t.s. elliot working fire guard duty on the roof of faber and faber during the London blitz and\tfinding his love for other people growing, coming to the realisation that the world is full of beauty that needs to be preserved.\nAgainst hate stands love:\n‘Who then devised this torment? Love.’\ntrack one uses samples from transacord recordings of steam trains, track two a recording of t.s. elliot reading the first verse of the lyric section of little gidding\nThe world turns and the world changes,\nBut one thing does not change.\nIn all of my years, one thing does not change,\nHowever you disguise it, this thing does not change:\nThe perpetual struggle of Good and Evil.\n-T. S. Eliot, Choruses from The Rock (1934)\ndownload here:  buddhistonfire.com/2012/10/39-elizabeth-veldon---the-transport/",

            "about": "this album discusses the act of grieving through the spiritual practices of alchemy.\nrather than being a striving for riches alchemy was a spiritual process in which the act of spiritual cleansing is mirrored in the raising of base metals (such as lead) to gold (alchemists believed they where the same material) through the removal of the spiritual impurities in the base materials.\nthe colours in the artwork are the colours of the alchemical process - from black to white to yellow and finally red.\nfor for anastasia in her grief\nthis is a companion piece to 'all the rest have thirty one'",

I will not here discuss which creature this is as to do so is to invite speculation and questioning of indigenous people which they do not want.\nwe do not own other people's culture.\nalso: have fun this halloween.",

            "about": "one of the things you can do when working with folk song is to choose what version of a song you work with. here i have stripped out two verses from this song about two sisters who hid themselves away from the plague in perthshire only for the young man who loved one of them to infect them.\nin my version i have chosen to focus on the mechanics of the story only and produce a text which, i think, is more abstracted.\nthe other tracks here spin off from this song.",

            "about": "this album came about after a discussion of the use of the public school story form by j k rowling in the harry potter books.\ni contend that this is, at heart, a reactionary form and share kipling's insight that it was implicated in the death toll of world war one as evidenced by his retelling of some of the stalky stories within the setting of books which explicitly discussed this event\nthere was a fault with my audio interface and this produced some unexpected sounds but i have chosen to keep these in the recording\nthese are the titles of each movement\n1. 'there was not a penny to choose between any of them\nfor thoroughness, efficiency, and a certain clarity of outline that\nstamps the work of the artist' [from 'the impressionists' by kipling]\n2. 'and I must trouble you with an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast. What a year it has been' [from 'harry potter and the sorcerer's stone' by j k rowling]\n3. 'little I'd ever teach a son, but hitting,\nshooting, war, hunting, all the arts of hurting.\nwell, that's what I learnt,—that, and making money\n[from 'a terre' by wilfred owen]",

            "about": "this album was commissioned for the 'we need no swords' podcast.\nit was written for a friend who is recovering from a serious illness and the first four tracks take extracts from sontag's writings on illness (which give my friend great solace) and set them for piano.\nthe fourth track is based on a photograph of the crowd at an early rolling stones gig that their mother attended; with the piece i try to imagine a photograph of their mother at the gig.\ni have also included a sketch i made towards this final track (as well as the cover for the earlier release of this track) and my interview for this show which was cut to allow it to fit the show's format.\nthe podcast can be heard at:  www.mixcloud.com/pmargree/we-need-no-swords-episode-27-elizabeth-veldon/\nsontag's writings where on cancer and it is cancer from which my friend is recovering. i had intended to make this a physical release to raise money for cancer care but instead have allowed it to be downloaded for free and ask you, as a listener, to contribute (if you can) to any charity you feel needs the money most",

            "about": "this album was intended for release yesterday to commemorate the anniversary of luther's action which set in motion the reformation.\nthe title was suggested when a friend informed me that you could get rubber ducks with martin luther's face on them and i suggested that i would like to buy one to 'sit atop a pile of shattered rood screens'\nthis album is not intended as an anti-lutharian one but as a discussion of the darkness that followed the reformation and takes carl watkins' 'the undiscovered country: journeys among the dead' as a starting point for the impact of the reformation on congregations and the iconoclasm of the post-reformation period in britian as symptomatic of the religious violence of the period.\nif you want to buy a martin luther rubber duck you can get them on ebay",

            "about": "this year's halloween album is two ghost stories with live improvised piano acomplement.\nthe stories are my own experiencerience or perhaps they are not, their veracity is left to the listener to decide.\nthe piano is distorted and loud in this release, just so you know.\nthe second story is also quite dark and the whole release comes with cws:\ndrug use, psychosis, mental illness, homelessness and a sense of dread.\noh yea, the audio is a bit jump-scary (if that makes sense)\nit strikes me, while mixing these for release, that the term 'my own true ghost story' may not register with most listeners. it belongs to one of kipling's 'indian' stories of the same title and can be found online.\nblackwood's conversational tone when telling ghost stories can be experienced in this recording and may stand as a second little treat for halloween if you don't know his work:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCdX_hLo4kc",

            "about": "this album uses the 1973 recording of handel's messiah conducted by karl richter and is based upon an understanding of the piece based upon marissen's 'tainted glory in handel's messiah' described by the publisher thus:\n'every easter, audiences across the globe thrill to performances of handel’s “hallelujah chorus,” but they would probably be appalled to learn the full extent of the oratorio’s anti-judaic message. in this pioneering study, respected musicologist michael marissen examines handel’s masterwork and uncovers a disturbing message of anti-judaism buried within its joyous celebration of the divinity of the christ.\ndiscovering previously unidentified historical source materials enabled the author to investigate the circumstances that led to the creation of the messiah and expose the hateful sentiments masked by magnificent musical artistry—including the famed “hallelujah chorus,” which rejoices in the “dashing to pieces” of god’s enemies, among them the “people of Israel.” marissen’s fascinating, provocative work offers musical scholars and general readers alike an unsettling new appreciation of one of the world’s best-loved and most widely performed works of religious music",

This was intended to cover all of the main rivers but only these two pieces were ever completed.\nTrack 3 relates to a 19th century trend in portrait photography where a mother was swayed in cloth while holding her child. The lengths of cloth reminded me of the burkas worn by so many women and the ghostly quality of the images of the 19th century interest in spiritualism which gave many women an independent income. The voices in this piece are both the spirits communicating with the medium and the voice of women silenced (literally) by yards of heavy cloth.\nTracks 4 and 5 were to form part of an album documenting childhood memories and my relationship with my late brother Thomas (né 'Tam'). He was 37 when he died and I am in my 37th year. My brother was born before I was and I will soon be older than he ever will.\nThis collection of pieces is dedicated to his memory.",

Behold,\nA ram, caught in a thicket by its horns;\nOffer the Ram of Pride instead of him.\nBut the old man would not so, but slew his son,\nAnd half the seed of Europe, one by one.",

            "about": "creating art in the midst of suffering seems like a pointless or, at the very least, challenging, thing to do. i have felt uneasy about doing so as it feels insensitive or even exploitative.\nhowever...great art exists from times of great suffering and even plague.\nI dreamt of Nashe's great poem recently and find myself taking some comfort from it. This isn't simply in terms of it's relevance to the memento mori tradition but also because it is great art produced in a time of death and suffering.\nI offer this meditation on the poem in the hope of creating a dim shadow of its spender.\nA Litany in Time of Plague\nThomas Nashe\nAdieu, farewell, earth’s bliss;\nThis world uncertain is;\nFond are life’s lustful joys;\nDeath proves them all but toys;\nNone from his darts can fly;\nI am sick, I must die.\nLord, have mercy on us!\nRich men, trust not in wealth,\nGold cannot buy you health;\nPhysic himself must fade.\nAll things to end are made,\nThe plague full swift goes by;\nI am sick, I must die.\nLord, have mercy on us!\nBeauty is but a flower\nWhich wrinkles will devour;\nBrightness falls from the air;\nQueens have died young and fair;\nDust hath closed Helen’s eye.\nI am sick, I must die.\nLord, have mercy on us!\nStrength stoops unto the grave,\nWorms feed on Hector brave;\nSwords may not fight with fate,\nEarth still holds ope her gate.\n‘Come, come!’ the bells do cry.\nI am sick, I must die.\nLord, have mercy on us!\nWit with his wantonness\nTasteth death’s bitterness;\nHell’s executioner\nHath no ears for to hear\nWhat vain art can reply.\nI am sick, I must die.\nLord, have mercy on us!\nHaste, therefore, each degree,\nTo welcome destiny;\nHeaven is our heritage,\nEarth but a player’s stage;\nMount we unto the sky.\nI am sick, I must die.\nLord, have mercy on us!\nimage: 1665 woodcut, artist unknown",

Certainly, there is a fragility that comes across in this album.\nAs I listen to the album, I have an inkling that Veldon is sitting there contemplating their shared past and the inevitable future without her Brother. There is a mass of raw emotion in this album without the grand finesse of an orchestration. This is a private grief.'\nwww.theparishnews.com/2016/10/elizabeth-veldon-i-child-i-believed-dead-lived-high-places-i-will-walk-campsies-i-find-brother/",

Will heat move\nOnly through the mocking-bird\nHeard once? Still hills\nWait. Gates wait. Purple trees,\nWhite trees, wait, wait,\nDelay, decay. Living, living,\nNever moving. Ever moving\nIron thoughts came with me\nAnd go with me:\nRed river, river, river.\n(headphones are recommended for maximum isolation)",
