            "about": "Another archive album. The inspiration to form this duo and make this album came from the guitarist Henry Kaiser's album Hope You Like Our New Direction. Like Henry, Viv and I both have very broad musical interests, and we were both actively pursuing those interests at the time and decided to collaborate and formed Avant Roots. The name reflected the intersectionality of all the music we were performing then, from Rembetika to Blues; Free Improvisation to Turkish, African and Hawaiian influenced self composed songs, extended vocal and guitar techniques; acoustic and electronic. An assimilation and mutation of the babel of world sounds. Past present and future music maybe?",

            "about": "Beach Crossings-Pacific Footprints is a meditation in words and music on European presence and colonization in the Pacific, from the first landing of the Dolphin at Tahiti in 1766 up until the dropping of the atomic bomb in World War two on Hiroshima and contemporary Indonesian colonization practices.\nDuring my 30 years living in Italy Pino Saulo, radio producer for the RAI Italian radio afforded me many opportunities to produce projects that I would have had less of a chance of achieving elsewhere and my 'opera' Beach Crossings is one of those many projects.\nInspired by the writing of Greg Dening, an Australian Historian of The Pacific, and with his blessing I used the title of his book, Beach Crossings, and this quote from it that summed up my piece.\n\"A voyage across culture, time and self. A view from both sides of the beach whereto beach is a metaphor as well as a reality to be crossed. A space of meeting and departure on several levels\"\nThe music is mostly improvised following a graphic score, some hand signals and some pre-rehearsed songs and ideas.\nThe text is borrowed and/or adapted with permission from Greg Dening, David Toop, Steve Feld, New Internationalist, The Cambridge History Of Pacific Islanders and other unknown sources as well as original observations and thoughts.\nOriginally created in English I had it translated into Italian (why not? It is an opera of sorts) but have had it translated and performed in other languages (French, Portugese and Australian English) with different combinations of musicians and even as a duo with radio producer Brent Clough for ABC Radio in Australia.\nThere is an accompanying film Planet Pacific-Pieces Of Heaven? shot on super eight film that I have used as a backdrop screened for live performance.\nThis premier version of Beach Crossings-Pacific Footprints was performed live at RAI studios and first appeared as a c.d. on Tracce records in 2007.\nI was extremely lucky to have the pleasure of working with the musicians, all local Romans, as well the participation of the now late Richard Nunns and the still very present Alvin Curran.",

            "about": "Collaboration, improvisation, innovation.\nThe remit for Black Flamingo.\nDuring the Covid lockdown period I started on line long distance collaborations with a team of friends and made Oceans Of Milk and Treacle for Room40.\nA family of long time associates plus some more recent and one that I have never met in person. All of them with a unique ability to respond creatively, in any genre or context, in a creative, spontaneous and improvised manner.\nBlack Flamingo.\nCollaboration, improvisation, innovation.\nFeaturing Geoff Hawkins on tenor sax. Our 60 year friendship goes back to the 1960s and my first band The Blues Committee then on through the 1970s to Trout Steel and the Machine Gun Company on the Dawn label meeting up again in the mid 1990s on my Island Songs c.d. and more recently on Oceans Of Milk and Treacle on Room40.\nHis son Aaron Hawkins who I have known since he was born, is now a prominent figure on the Bristol music scene in the UK joins us on tenor saxophone as well.\nElliott Sharp, guitarist, composer, improviser from the Downtown New York music scene. We first played together in Rome many years ago. We have a duo digital collection on my Bandcamp site and here on Black Flamingo Elliott plays bass clarinet.\nJon Raskin, a founder member of The Rova saxophone quartet based in California surprised me one night in London by appearing in the audience at a folk club concert I gave. We also have a duo collection together on my Bandcamp site.\nScot Ray, slidationist; lap steel and pedal steel guitar visionary. We have never met in the real(?) world, only on line. I am always seeking audacious players of both those instruments and Scot is a true star. Check out his own solo and other projects.\nMichael Thieke, a fellow part time Roman part time Berliner member of the International Nothing (great name) brings peace on the clarinet with breathy playing on this most beautiful of wind instruments.\nViv Corringham has shared her voice on many past musical roads with me from Greek Rembetronika to an improvising trio with Lol Coxhill and Soundwalks in hills around Hong Kong.\nTim Hill on Baritone sax. We go back to my 1980’s in Reading in the UK. Together we had Beating Time with Paul Burwell on drums and Gary Jones on bass, both sadly gone now and Mayhem Quartet with Pat Thomas on keys and Neil Palmer our improvising dj both happily still with us. Then we started Trystero System which became a floating membership duo spanning several years and has included both Viv Corringham and Pat Thomas with myself and continues from time to time.\nLastly The Migrant School of Bodies Choir was the result of a workshop in Milan for a performance/dance piece organised by choreographer/dancer Ariella Vidach. The text is each member counting from one to 26 in their own language each one starting to count after the neighbour had reached the number eight . Most of the members were from Africa and shared no common African language. The rhythmic and tonal variations set up an interesting shingling effect with the voices tumbling over one another.\nCollaboration, improvisation, innovation was the theme, Sun Ra socks and a Bflat hat was the key.\nMike Cooper/ Bangkok / March 18 2023.",

            "about": "Buy Batteries And Shelter Pets was the advice given to the UK residents recently, preceding the advance of three major storms across the countries. Almost as absurd as the advice of “put a brown paper bag over your head and get under your desk” given to us as school children in the 1960s should a nuclear attack be expected, but that was of course ‘last century’.\nIn the 21st Century it seems the absurd has not gone away and parts of our so called civilisation are in fact still living in the middle ages while others stagger backwards and forwards in a seemingly schizophrenic digital nightmare as our politicians not only fail us but are in fact destroying us.\nThese two pieces were recorded on February 25th and 26th 2022 as Russia invades the Ukraine. On Room 40 I am usually associated with a more tranquil, ambient style of music but these two pieces are an expression of my outrage and impotence.\n“Protest and attract attention/ Our emotional style will register annoyance..”\nMike Cooper/Valencia/Spain - March 1st 2022.",
            "credits": "released March 4, 2022\nAll proceeds from sales of this edition will go to The Red Cross relief fund for those in he Ukraine.\nCredits - All music Mike Cooper / Recorded 25th/26th February 2022/Valencia/Spain.\nMike Cooper - Processed Lap Steel Guitar heard as played no overdubs.",

            "about": "From Mike Cooper\nThis is my film score for Anthony Banua-Simon’s documentary film Cane Fire. When I made Rayon Hula in 2004 in a garden shed on a four track cassette machine and two mini disc recorders and released it as a cd.r on my DIY Hipshot record label I never dreamt that it would have four more lives. Its second life was as a double ten inch vinyl lp on Cabin Records, and the third as a CD on Lawrence English’s Room40 Records who then released its most recent incarnation as a vinyl lp edition to celebrate its 15th anniversary. I also hadn’t envisaged that it would also lead to film director Anthony Banau-Simon sending me an email and asking if I might be interested in providing the score for a documentary film he was making which was about Hawaii. He knew Rayon Hula and other releases in my Ambient, Electronic, Exotica series of records and thought that I might have something to contribute to his film.\n“Cane Fire, the film, examines the past and present of the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi, interweaving four generations of family history, numerous Hollywood productions, and troves of found footage to create a kaleidoscopic portrait of the economic and cultural forces that have cast indigenous and working-class residents as “extras” in their own story.”\nI have been making film soundtracks to perform live to silent films for 20 plus years. Starting in 1995 with the great German expressionist director F.W.Murnau’s film Tabu, which was filmed in Tahiti, I began to specifically seek out other films that featured The Pacific Ocean Islands or films with stories set in or about them, as part of my repertoire.\nMy main instrument, for most of my 50 plus years as a professional musician has been the Hawaiian guitar or Lap Steel and the first time I ever saw Tabu I thought that it was the perfect film to play some Hawaiian guitar licks over in a public screening. I am also a fan of the music of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny both of whom, in the 1950’s played something they called Exotica music. Included in the repertoire of Martin Denny, and Les Baxter another Exotica composer, were compositions of pieces of music that were supposedly influenced by music from other cultures and places. In fact neither of them had ever been to any of these places and their music had very little, if anything, to do with the real music from the far away places that they were supposed to be from. They had in fact invented music from invented places and invented a genre and I wanted to make a 21st Century version. So far I have released eight volumes in the series of my Ambient, Electronic, Exotica series, most of which are on Room40, and this one makes nine.",

My set was free improvisation; some cover versions of folk and pop songs and some of my own songs. The title of the record and some of the improvised pieces were taken from Sam Shepard's writing. Sam, one of my favourite writers, has sadly died since I recorded this record and I dedicate it to his memory.\nThis album is also available on vinyl from Backwards Records -  backwardsrec.bandcamp.com/album/distant-songs-of-madmen\nMike Cooper - 2018",

            "about": "From Mike Cooper\nEver since purchasing the original release of Silver Apples Of The Moon, the 1969 album by Morton Subotnick, and Early Fall by Fall Mountain in 1979, I have wanted to be able to ‘play’ electronics.\nSubotnick’s album (I love it so much I have both the original and the re-release on vinyl) sounded improvised to me back then. I have subsequently learnt it was not, but was rather put together over a long period and ‘composed’.\nOn the other hand Bob Ostertag, in Fall Mountain, was playing and improvising on his Serge synth. Not an easy task on a system you had to patch. He also appeared, to my delight, on albums by Eugene Chadbourne and John Zorn in the early 80’s. Just in time for Lol Coxhill, Roger Turner and myself to organise The Recedents in 1982.\nI wanted to be able to:\n1...\nemulate the synth sound, and playing, of both Subotnick and Ostertag, but using guitar and effects pedals. I actually recorded bits of Silver Apples onto a cassette and used it to make samples into my Casio SK1, the cheapest polyphonic sampler there was in the early 80s.\nI have never got to grips with patching the likes of a VCS, Buchla, Serge, Aalto synths etc. I never found them fast enough for what I wanted to do especially reacting to other musicians with them while improvising. Bob did, glory be to him, and recently he has found a way of using a gamepad controller to do this too.\nNow there are apps to do what I was looking for and these pieces were all recorded direct to stereo using one on my iPhones, and recorded into my Zoom H2 while sat on a swing seat on my rooftop\n2...\nterrace while the sun went down in November 2022.",

            "about": "Fratello Mare, a reference to Folco Quilici’s classic film of the same name, is the latest tropical opus from UK born, Italian based musician Mike Cooper.\nIt’s Cooper’s continuing ode to the Pacific, its people and the traditions that have flowed from that part of the world into seemingly endless iterations within contemporary culture. Recorded across 2014, the album dovetails neatly with his other Room40 editions White Shadows In The South Seas and the post-everything classic Rayon Hula. It expands his combining of highly personal lap steel playing, with exotic music and percussion alongside field recordings made on islands across South East Asia and the Caribbean whilst on residencies and other travels.\nAt the record’s heart is a yearning these distant islands that dot the vast oceans. A love letter of sorts, a poetic and dreamlike wandering, that sonically traverses the ever-changing edge of land and sea and Cooper's musical imagination.",

            "about": "A word from Mike Cooper...\nKiribati and Globe Notes were my entry into the, self titled, world of Ambient / Electronic / Exotica . In 1999 Kiribati was the first c.d.r on my Hipshot label which I began because no one else was issuing any of my music at the time. Now, even though some have since been re-issued on other labels, all six volumes are available on Room40 in one format or another.\nMy original sleeve notes for Kiribati read “The Republic Of Kiribati is an island nation state in the Pacific Ocean. During the summer of 1999 two atolls in the chain disappeared beneath the waves after storms. Although the palms are often 25 metres tall the islands themselves...are only 4 to 5 metres above sea level...global warming is a disaster.”\nFrom Globe Notes - “My (musician) friend Ab Baars told me a story of his being transported through the night in Bali as a boy. The night sounds and different music and voices he heard as he passed silently, half awake, half dreaming, through the villages.” This is the scenario of both Kiribati and Globe Notes. Half remembered, half imagined, a kind of hauntological set of dreamscapes.\nThese pieces were all analogue, both the recording and the instrumentation, made on a four track cassette machine and two mini discs. All the field recordings were made either on a Walkman cassette recorder or mini disc. I had no computer at the time. I feel these digital re-masters retain the warmth and special character of those originals and I still don't know how I did some it.\nCan instrumental music be protest music? In my present situation (April 2020) in lockdown isolation during ‘the virus’ these compositions appear to me as protest even more so than when I first made them. Incidentally there is an accompanying edition of ambient field recordings from another island, Pulau Ubin, with the more direct title \"You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone.” on my Bandcamp site.\nmikecooper.bandcamp.com/music",

Dedicated to our aquatic, avian and insect friends.\nThese pieces reflect a change in my pace of lifestyle after moving from Rome, a place I lived for 30 plus years, to Valencia in Spain, a much more liveable city and within walking distance to the sea.\nThey are also the result of scaling back my equipment due to the fact that airlines seem to have become musician unfriendly lately, breaking or losing instruments and equipment.\nTau Moe, one of my favourite Hawaiian guitarists, wrote \"The rhythm of the island, is in the rolling sea ...\"",

            "about": "A word from Mike Cooper...\nKiribati and Globe Notes were my entry into the, self titled, world of Ambient / Electronic / Exotica . In 1999 Kiribati was the first c.d.r on my Hipshot label which I began because no one else was issuing any of my music at the time. Now, even though some have since been re-issued on other labels, all six volumes are available on Room40 in one format or another.\nMy original sleeve notes for Kiribati read “The Republic Of Kiribati is an island nation state in the Pacific Ocean. During the summer of 1999 two atolls in the chain disappeared beneath the waves after storms. Although the palms are often 25 metres tall the islands themselves...are only 4 to 5 metres above sea level...global warming is a disaster.”\nFrom Globe Notes - “My (musician) friend Ab Baars told me a story of his being transported through the night in Bali as a boy. The night sounds and different music and voices he heard as he passed silently, half awake, half dreaming, through the villages.” This is the scenario of both Kiribati and Globe Notes. Half remembered, half imagined, a kind of hauntological set of dreamscapes.\nThese pieces were all analogue, both the recording and the instrumentation, made on a four track cassette machine and two mini discs. All the field recordings were made either on a Walkman cassette recorder or mini disc. I had no computer at the time. I feel these digital re-masters retain the warmth and special character of those originals and I still don't know how I did some it.\nCan instrumental music be protest music? In my present situation (April 2020) in lockdown isolation during ‘the virus’ these compositions appear to me as protest even more so than when I first made them. Incidentally there is an accompanying edition of ambient field recordings from another island, Pulau Ubin, with the more direct title \"You’re Gonna Miss Me When I’m Gone.” on my Bandcamp site.  mikecooper.bandcamp.com/music",

            "about": "Artist page:  paradiseofbachelors.com/mike-cooper\nALBUM ABSTRACT\nMike Cooper wrote his final songwriter record, a suite of gloaming glam-rock anthems performed with a spiritual jazz trio, while living on the Costa Tropical of Granada, Spain, an era when he was considering retiring from music altogether. A chance encounter and a last-ditch record deal convinced him to make one last album, which he recorded in 1974 at Pathway Studios in London, with “The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World,” featuring the inventive South African jazz rhythm section of Louis Moholo and Harry Miller with UK saxophonist Mike Osborne.\nThis first-ever reissue includes a bonus CD of Milan Live Acoustic 2018, a previously unreleased solo set that represents Cooper’s return, after forty-four years pursuing free improvisation and electronics, to a new, deconstructed approach to singing, steel guitar, and songcraft.\nThe deluxe LP+CD edition also features a six-panel insert with additional artwork and an essay by the artist about both records. The deluxe 2xCD gatefold edition features an eight-panel version of the same insert.\n“Beautiful, fucked-up mid-70s rock that’s really not like anything else. A mélange of mersh/avant/blues/folk/rock/jazz shiteroo, Life and Death in Paradise is a most splendid anomaly with hints of everyone from Gram Parsons to Michael Hurley to the Welfare State … Allow it into your head, and it will blossom like the strange mushroom it is.” – Byron Coley\nALBUM NARRATIVE\nIn the wake of his magisterial triptych of early 1970s avant-folk-rock records—Trout Steel (1970), Places I Know (1971), and The Machine Gun Co. (1972) (all previously reissued by Paradise of Bachelors)—the British songwriter, guitarist, and fledgling improviser Mike Cooper retreated to the Costa Tropical of Granada, Spain. With no prospects for touring or recording again, his fiery band the Machine Gun Co. had disintegrated. Cooper sets the scene in his liner notes of the first-ever reissue of his unjustly forgotten next album Life and Death in Paradise (1974):\n\"No one came running with offers of fame and riches, and we fell apart, and I left the country and headed for the beach, disillusioned and a bit disorientated musically. I went to Almuñécar in Andalusia, a place I had been going since 1969, because a painter friend from Reading, Rowland Fade—who made the collage in the gatefold of my earlier album Trout Steel—had moved there in 1968.\n\"It was not exactly a paradise. Palm trees were not native there, so they had been imported by the mayor, purchased from his brother who, legend has it, sourced them from Cuba.\"\nIt was in this synthetic coastal “paradise,” unmoored and adrift, considering retiring from music altogether, that he began tentatively writing new songs.\n\"Time passed slowly in Almuñécar, and I made leather bags, painted the insides of empty swimming pools, attempted to sell some of my artworks at a market in Málaga, and generally hung out drinking and smoking (cigarettes) at the beachside bars.\"\nA chance encounter with producer Tony Hall, who offered Cooper a last-ditch record deal on Hall’s nascent Fresh Air label, convinced him to make one last album—with the stipulation that he could assemble what he called “The Greatest Rock and Roll Band in the World.”\n\"I told Tony that I would do it if I could hire some of my South African jazz musician friends that I had used on my Pye/Dawn albums and some friends from Reading that I still knew and admired. Tony loved jazz and was more than happy for me to use whomever I wanted. I called up Harry Miller, Louis Moholo, and Mike Osborne, who were in fact a trio at the time … and several local Reading heroes, including the singer-songwriter Terry Clarke.\"\nThe result, recorded live with minimal overdubbing at Pathway Studios in London, was Life and Death in Paradise, an utterly singular suite of gloaming glam-rock anthems performed with a spiritual jazz trio comprising the inventive South African jazz rhythm section of Moholo and Miller with UK saxophonist Osborne. Unlike anything else in Cooper’s extensive catalog, the record’s six interwoven songs, world-weary metanarratives about music and the artist’s sunstricken exile in Andalusia, vibrate with heat shimmer and polyphonic pastiche, prefiguring his later tropical travelogues.\n\"That title of the album became so loaded for me as the years passed and also reflected (still does) my attitude toward certain aspects of the music business. Despite going back to record, I was still not convinced about many things, and a lot of the lyrics on the record express my doubts and anger about it.\"\nFresh Air fizzled, and Life and Death became Cooper’s final record as a songwriter, having pushed the form as far as he could. Drifting north from Spain back to the UK, he fell into the scene of the London Musicians Collective (LMC)—including Paul Burwell, David Toop, and saxophonist Lol Coxhill, Cooper’s bandmate in the Recedents—and fully embraced free improvisation.\n\"I decided that I was no longer interested in the direct, personal experience, narrative type of song or the form in which most songs were framed and presented … I was musically more interested in improvising and not having to play the same thing at every performance.\"\nHe was still, however, interested in singing and lyrics, so, influenced by Tom Phillips, William Burroughs, and Brion Gysin, he began experimenting with text collage and cut-up techniques, arriving at his own hybrid compositional strategy for improvisatory songs.\nThe previously unreleased solo set Milan Live Acoustic 2018 represents Cooper’s return, after more than four decades pursuing free improvisation and electronics, to a new, deconstructed approach to singing, lap steel guitar, and songcraft. Presented here together with Life and Death in Paradise, the two records provide fascinating bookends to Mike Cooper’s long, mercurial, and pioneering practice as a songmaker.\n\"In my early years as an acoustic blues player, there was no amplification, even for voice, in most folk clubs where I was performing. Milan Live Acoustic 2018 is in a way a return to my roots as a solo acoustic singer/guitarist, as last fully documented on Life and Death in Paradise forty-four years earlier. It’s just me: my voice, guitar, and some small electronic devices played with no amplification. The only preparation was the lyrics, which can change from performance to performance as well. Everything else is improvisation. What else is there?\"\nKEY POINTS\n+ The first-ever reissue of Life and Death in Paradise, Mike Cooper’s final songwriter record, and the first release of Milan Live Acoustic 2018\n+ Deluxe LP+CD edition features 140g black virgin vinyl; matte jacket with spot gloss details; and a six-panel foldout insert with additional artwork and an essay by the artist about both records\n+ Deluxe 2xCD edition features a matte gatefold jacket with spot gloss details, and an eight-panel version of the same insert\n+ RIYL: Derek Bailey, David Bowie, Tim Buckley, Sandy Bull, John Cale, Michael Chapman, Lol Coxhill, Johnny Dyani, Davey Graham, Steve Gunn, Van Morrison, Louis Moholo, Mike Osborne, Lou Reed, Sonny Sharrock, Television, Welfare State\n+ Artist page/bio/tour dates/links/back catalog:  paradiseofbachelors.com/mike-cooper",

From down here on rock and roll hi way. Upon the wall/a sound we all know it’s something passing. But in my ear/it brings so much fear because I’m breathing/in its slipstream. And there’s a sound of burning coming up from down here on rock and roll hi way. Back here inside/this suicide of mine/ it’s nearly over. It could be saved, but who’s that brave and anyhow/who really needs it. There’s a sound of singing coming up from down here on rock and roll hi way. From a distance/my resistance it just appears so very useless.  She knows that I just can’t understand and that’s the hand she’ll use/to win me over. Now there’s a sound of music coming up from down here on rock and roll hi way. Down on the floor/the battle roars but nobody/no nobody/is even watching. As they drag away the half-decayed remains of last year’s victim. Now there’s a sound of nothing coming up from down here on rock and roll hi way.",

Glance up and I can see the sky through the veil as it shades my eyes from the sun as it is rising on this morning. Hearing noises coming in from the hill just like a locust and its high whining trill Wishing now that I was not ever leaving So that I could glance up and I could see the sky Through the veil as it shades my eyes from the sun as it is rising on this morning. Watching boats sailing out on the sea that could bring you back close to me Watching now as all the smoke is slowly rising. BEADS ON A STRING Storm clouds are rolling in from Morocco thunder crashing and lightning flashing. Electric black night summer skylight lights a smile on Spanish Rose. In a doorway mandolin play Montevideo lady singing Touch of southern starlight make everything alright warm sunshine and sweet orange wine. And the radio man play late night rock and roll till daylight Rock and roll on the radio until daylight come.",

With my steel third finger I just could not linger on the brink just like some half-believer. Well I was brought here by coincidence but now I find that these incidents have hurt me more than I could freely say before. So I hide my eyes behind dark glasses now I find the lights hurt my sight and I don’t want to tell night from day. I could steal you a song, but I sang blues so long that soon it was reds that were needed. Then a voice in my ear shouted get outta here and I knew it was a voice to be heeded. chorus. By the hour they pay, and then they pray you don’t pass that way just for a bit. They grin when you’re near but if you get where you can hear you’re sure to find you’re the next one    to get hit. chorus",

            "about": "This was original a two CD-R release on my Hipshot label in 2008. The concept is an audio diary of field recordings collected over several visits to Bangkok. The Chao Phraya River, the longest in Thailand, runs through the city. Like Venice, Bangkok was built literally on the water, and was traversed by a series of canals. These canals have mostly now been filled in and paved over with roads, but the Chao Phraya is still a very active means of commercial and public transportation through the city serviced by river ferries. These river ferries, whose role is very much akin to buses, have stops at 36 (maybe more now) floating metal platforms.\nThe first part of the recordings are an audio diary of my walks throughout the city to and from the ferries. It starts with the hum of traffic and early morning birds heard from my hotel window. These sounds of the city awakening segue into a street recording and one of the best 'found compositions' it has been my pleasure to record.\nA visit to the giant reclining Buddha reveals the sound of coins being dropped into metal bowls as offering and then chants of Buddhist monks as other temples and street sounds are passed and recorded. A music school and a huge Hi-Fi market\nThe metal platforms are designed with rollers which enable them to float freely up and down metal pylons driven into the river bed. They rise and fall with the tides or waves caused by passing traffic and produce these sounds, musical or animal- like, each platform revealing its different audio character.\nThe last track was not on the original cdr release and is atwo blind street musicians, a woman singing and her accompanying portable keyboard player that passed me in a busy street one day.\nIt is the river singing in many voices.",

It was recorded in 2004 at The Steelworks in Rome, apart from track one, which features Tim Catlin on prepared guitar and was recorded in 2003 in Melbourne and re-mixed by Robin Schmidt.\nMy metal box is my National Tri-Plate resonator guitar. Made around 1932 ten years before i was born it has been with me since 1958. All of these pieces are made from sounds found on that guitar, sampled and played live into these six post digital primitivist compositions. I started my musical life playing Country Blues on this instrument and i hope these pieces still retain some of the textural feel and spirit of that music. It is dedicated to the memory of John Fahey.",

            "about": "A cine concert soundtrack for a live performance and screening of Aelita Queen Of Mars. This film is two hours long and so is the continuous soundtrack that I perform live. Presented here are 40 continuous one minute excerpts split into two 20 minute sets.\nMade in Russia in 1924 and directed by Yakov Protazanov it is based on Alexei Tolstoy's novel of the same name. One of the earliest full-length films about space travel, one of the most notable parts of the film are its remarkable constructivist Martian sets by by Isaac Rabinovich and Victor Simov and costumes designed by Aleksandra Ekster. Their influence can be seen in a number of later films, including the Flash Gordon serials and probably Fritz Lang's Metropolis and Woman in the Moon and in the more recent Liquid Sky.\nMy soundtrack, apart from specially scored pieces, includes re-edited,re-mixed and sampled sections from some of my early 70's records, including Trout Steel, The Machine Gun Company and Places I Know, all still available on both c.d. and vinyl.\nI have performed Aelita all over the world for many years, and this soundtrack first appeared as a one of my Hipshot cdr series.",

            "about": "This is second digital collaboration between Jon Raskin and Mike Cooper made during the Covid Pandemic via internet file sharing.\nHotel Noctambulo is a real place. In fact it is many real places that previously when we sometimes occupied ourselves as touring musicians we would have spent many nights there. But don't let that bother you and don't lose any sleep over it. Most of the titles for these improvised pieces were culled from Thomas Pynchon's novel Against The Day but are in no way meant to illustrate or indicate anything within or without that novel.\nJON RASKIN has been a member of Rova Saxophone Quartet for the last 42 years exploring the relationship of improvisation and composition, developing and honing the language of ensemble music and researching linguistic possibilities of the saxophone. He has performed and/ or recorded with Anthony Braxton, Fred Frith, Sam Rivers, Tim Berne, Phillip Johnston, Leo Smith, Frank Gratkowsi, Phillip Greenlief, Henry Kaiser and others. He plays Baritone, Alto, Soprano Saxophones, Electronics, Autoharp and voice.\nMIKE COOPER - For the past 50 years he has been an international artistic explorer constantly pushing the boundaries.He plays lap steel guitar and sings, he is an improviser and composer, song-maker, a visual and installation artist; film and video maker and radio arts producer. He collaborated for 20 plus years with saxophone player Lol Coxhill and drummer Roger Turner in one of Britains most adventurous improvising groups The Recedents as well as touring internationally as a solo artist. -“His eclectic attitude has often embraced the idea of re-representing a multitude of cultural references , through a very particular way of mixing elements and fantasies into a visionary model that goes beyond the simple idea of multiculturalism” - Valerio Mannucci NERO.",

            "about": "I am always on the look out for Lap Steel players who are \"outside the box' of the generic music usually associated with the instrument. Fabrizio at Long Song Records in Italy sent me a c.d. of improvisations by Scot Ray and Jim McAuley (Second Earth) - I was delighted to discover Scot Ray played lap steel guitar well outside the box and immediately went to his Bandcamp site and purchased more. As isolation set in here in Spain I decided to contact him and suggest a virtual meeting and file sharing collaboration. This is the result and more will be forthcoming we hope. The title of the collection, in Indonesian, translates as Two Coconut Heads.- Mike Cooper.\n“Getting to know the formidable intrepid encyclopedic slide world of Mike Cooper has been a neuron expanding adventure. That the universe conspired (in)directly via Fabrizio Perissinotto, Jim McAuley, and Erik Griswold, to give us an opportunity to converse long distance - well, it was all kinds of non-fixed pitch post-exotica pedal tweaking goodness and an unexpected delight in the surreality of things to dive into this collaboration with such a stellar slide player and kindred sonicnaut.” - Scot Ray\nStory - \"Charles Budd Robinson (32), a Canadian botanist and explorer whose death on 5 December 1913 may have been caused by linguistic confusion, as he was known to speak the local language quite poorly. The Malay word for coconut, \"kelapa\" may have been confused with \"kepala\", the word for \"head\". If Robinson asked the boy to cut, \"potong\", down a coconut it may have been mispronounced and heard as a threat to cut off someones head. There was a local myth of a werewolf-like decapitator called a \"potong kepala\" and he was mistaken for one.\"",

            "about": "I always wondered why Sun Ra never chose to use Pedal Steel in the Arkestra as it often seems to me to be unlimited in its sonic qualities. Here I offer Astrosurfing pushing the sound as far away from its usual generic sound and its usual musical setting. Maybe it had to much association with Country Music for Sun Ra? I like the title Astrosurfer because it sounds like Astro Turf. These pieces are all played on my virtual lap and pedal steel guitars and digital effects in my iPhone.",

            "about": "Blue Guitar -- Mike Cooper --This collection first appeared on my Hipshot c.d.r. label in 2010 in a limited edition and was released on vinyl on Idea Records.\nAt the time I wrote -\n\"For the past couple of years I have been collating a body of text culled (mostly) from Thomas Pynchon’s novels ‘Gravity’s Rainbow’ and ‘V’ and making cut-up collage pieces in the spirit of William Burroughs, Kurt Schwitters, Tom Phillips and others.\nThose two particular novels interest me because they are set in the period that I was born, however no reference to that period is intended in my pieces. Hopefully a more contemporary comment is found lurking within the words, lines, and verse.\nIn 2010 my interest in playing the guitar in a more or less ‘traditional’ manner, but still incorporating various ‘extended techniques’ (as opposed to using it purely as a sound source) had been re-kindled along with a renewed interest in Blues, Greek Rembetika, Flamenco, Portuguese Fado and other traditional and improvised music around the Mediterranean, which in turn brought out the singer in me again.\nI have lived in the Mediterranean region for over 30 years and listened to its music and I wanted to make something that would hopefully have some of its spirit without making reference to any of it musically.\nNow in 2020, ten years since this original set, there have been many live versions of these pieces. The original idea was that I could sing them over any improvised backing as there is no fixed chord or harmonic sequence and the melody could be improvised as well. There are solo versions and versions with several other musicians but this original solo acoustic version remains one of my personal favourites.\n“ Things as they are / are changed upon the blue guitar ”- ( Wallace Stevens – Man With The Blue Guitar )\n\" Sometimes when you cut into the present the future leaks out.\" ( William Burroughs )\nReview - Lopsider Mike Cooper makes some of the most infuriating virtuoso acoustic guitar music we’ve ever heard, which means it’s all things good..(over) the fragments, shimmers, whines and wheezes of his unclassifiable guitar playing, he skews a little high-concept, cutting up the texts of post-moderniest Thomas Pynchon and collaging them into noisy singsong.\nIn all honesty, it’s some of my favourite Cooper: expressive in the string-bends and haughty transitions, his guitar does all manner of things, often letting out guttural wines but sometimes achieving voice-like coos. His voice, as always, is a sage, omnipresent force, residing over the record with the same conviction and measure as a Bill Callahan. His flicks of guitar rarely cohere with his Pynchon collages, but they always sound-off one another, the super-fast inflections of his strums and picks making many of his musings feel both absurd and poignant: he says things like “there’s a trick I’m trying to do with a knife” as his guitar bellows below.\nIt’s much in the line of Eric Chenaux’s abstract delivery, in that it sounds like his song is being held on an elastic band that could snap at any time. His vocal moves in one direction against the complexities and anachronisms of his guitar. (Norman's Records Review by Robin)",

            "about": "This is my film score for Anthony Banua-Simon’s documentary film Cane Fire.\n“Cane Fire, the film, examines the past and present of the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi, interweaving four generations of family history, numerous Hollywood productions, and troves of found footage to create a kaleidoscopic portrait of the economic and cultural forces that have cast indigenous and working-class residents as “extras” in their own story.”\nreleased August 6, 2021\nCane Fire the film as of May 2021.\n*Winner \"Best Feature Documentary\" 2020 Indie Memphis Film Festival\n*Official Selection:\n-2021 MoMA Doc Fortnight New York\n-2020 Hot Docs International Film Festival\n-2021 Prismatic Ground (Maysles Documentary Center and Screen Slate)\n-2021 DOXA Documentary Film Festival\n-2020 Denver Film Festival\n-2020 Hawaiʻi International Film Festival\n-2020 Hainan Island International Film Festival\n*Centerpiece Film, 2021 DisOrient Asian American Film Festival of Oregon\n*2021 San Diego Asian Film Festival Spring Showcase\n*MassArt Ciné Culture Screening Series\n*South Arts Southern Circuit 2020-2021 Season\n*Labocine \"Being An Island\" April 2021 Issue\nIn 1934 Family legend has it that Banua-Simon's great-grandfather Albert, a Filipino immigrant and labor organizer, was an extra in Lois Weber's lost film from 1934, Cane Fire, also known as White Heat and several of those participating in Anthony’s Cane Fire documentary have appeared as extras in other Hollywood / Hawaiian ‘exotica’ films.\n\"For decades, veteran experimental composer Mike Cooper has used his warped take on ‘50s exotica as a lens to address serious issues like climate change and colonialism. He returns to that sound on the extremely effective soundtrack for Cane Fire (2020), a documentary by Anthony Banua-Simon chronicling the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi and the exploitative presence of Hollywood there over the decades. “Is music political that has no lyrics? I would like to think so,” Cooper reflected in the notes for the reissue of his influential 2004 album Rayon Hula, and these hypnotic passages of fried electronics and lap-steel guitar are among the most powerful and damning of his career. For anyone who spent last month sucking down the toxic tiki drink that was Mike White’s The White Lotus (2021-), Cane Fire is an essential and equally sharp chaser.\"\nIt was a pleasure and honour to be asked to contribute to Cane Fire.\nReview of Cane Fire the film -  fromtheintercom.com/cane-fire-review/",

            "about": "Chris Abrahams and I have been playing music together since 2006 both live and at his studio in Sydney. I started to tour Australia, in various contexts, in 1995 and I met Chris at a concert organised by saxophonist Jim Denley. Realising that I was staying close to his home he invited me to drop by and maybe improvise together resulting in several studio and live concert recordings over the years as well as a huge archive of recorded music. This is a live recording of a concert we gave for the Sydney Improvised Music Associating. We have two other releases on Room40 records and one on the Beirut based Al Maslakh label.\nHopefully there will be more in the future, when he is not busy with The Necks, as he is a joy and inspiration to play music with and I think we do it very well together.\nOur album Praxis on Room40 is the most recent of our live recordings.\nroom40.bandcamp.com/album/praxis\nAnd the two below will further illustrate our journey.\nalmaslakh.bandcamp.com/album/trace\nboomkat.com/products/oceanic-feeling-like",

The French pavilion for the Venice Art Biennale 2017 was transformed by Xavier Veilhan and the pavilion’s curators, Christian Marclay and Lionel Bovier, into a musical space in which professional musicians from all over the world were invited to work throughout the duration of the exhibition. This is one of three sessions that was recorded over the duration of a week, The other two were with Lebanese trumpet player Mazen Kerbaj and British keyboards player Pat Thomas. Dr. Truna is from Valencia in Spain. All three sessions were improvised versions on my Glass Love installation/composition.\nAs well as playing prepared cello, hung around his neck guitar style, Truna also makes his own electronic instruments and digital pedals. His \"Magic Suitcase\"of electronics is a feature of every live performance. He is a multi media performer and improviser.",

            "about": "Acoustic nylon strung guitar is not something I usually play but a visit by Duck Baker to our home in Rome inspired me to dig out my Brazilian version. I met Duck at Stefan Grossman’s house in the late seventies and embarrassed myself by replying to his question about what did i play by answering \"you probably wouldn't understand\", assuming he only played folk music. He produced from his bag and gave me a copy of a record with him, Henry Kaiser, Eugene Chadbourne, Owen Maercks, Randy Hutton in improvised music trios. I think at that point I had never heard of any of them. I had just returned to the UK from Spain and was looking for a new direction for my music to go in and this, as well as discovering the London Musicians Collective, was what I needed to send me into some new musical space. These improvisations were recorded - on a Zoom H2 - in our kitchen in Rome, hence the title, Cumino in Mia Cucina.\n(Mike Cooper)\nI started touring England in the late ’70s when I was making folk/blues/ragtime guitar records for the Kicking Mule label. These tours made me a frequent visitor at the home of Kicking Mule boss Stefan Grossman in Fulham, and I met many other folk/blues musicians there. Mike Cooper was introduced to me as one of these, but he seemed unimpressed when he heard that I played such fare, and told me that what he really WAS interested in was any American guitarists who might be playing free improvised music. Well, says I, pretending not to be amazed, I guess I’m one of these guitarists you’re interested in, and there are some more on this record that just came out. So I showed him my copy of Eugene Chadbourne’s Guitar Trios LP, which featured Eugene, myself, and Randy Hutton on one side and Eugene with Henry Kaiser and Owen Maercks on the other. I don’t think Mike and I dared to play any free music in Stefan’s house that night, but we did get other chances over the years, and finally one day when I was visiting Rome in 2010, we sat down and recorded.

            "about": "These improvisations were all recorded in our individual Covid lockdown studios swapping sound files between New York and Valencia in Spain.\nMike's tracks were all one take live recordings, recorded outdoors at the Flamingo Lounge and Rooftop Bar using a Zoom H2 with his Brazilian 10 string Viola Caipira.\nE# performed on the Wishnevsky double neck guitar and mandocello recorded at Studio zOaR - NYC into ProTools using a Neumann TLM170 microphone into a Sytek MPA-4A preamp and a Royer R121 ribbon microphone into a Focusrite ISA220 preamp.\nElliott Wrote - \"I tried to match the lyricism and excitement of MIke’s parts and limited myself to one take for each piece to preserve the improvisatory feel.\"\nMike wrote - \"I met and played live with Elliott only twice before - the first time in the early 90s in Rome at a Controindicazione Festival and then again in New York in 2000, where we played as a trio together with Lukas Ligeti playing drums, at the Bowery Poetry Club. It was a great pleasure to meet him again, if only virtually, here.",

Gary Peters removed my vocals then sampled and looped parts of my guitar and played across the top to create another version.\nMy original recording had an equally bizarre start in that I recorded the guitar parts with a Zoom H2 recorder and then, without listening to the guitar parts recorded my vocals, also on the H2, and collaged them together. Here Gary reverses the procedure and then proceeds to create the versions heard here, playing pedal steel guitar, mandolin, banjo and synths.",

            "about": "This is an abbreviated version of the 2006 release on my Hipshot c.d.r label and are a dedication to Giacinto Scelsi who lived and died in Rome where I was living at that time and where I recorded these pieces. They are also dedicated to my friend Alvin Curran who at one period of his life was an assistant to Scelsi.\nA review from the same year of the recordings by Jonathan Dean in Brainwashed.\n\"Giacinto represents yet another new approach from Cooper, this time using the specific sound archicture of his National tri-plate resophonic guitar, exploring the sound produced on open strings with a handheld battery-operated electric fan. This produces a continuous note, not unlike an e-bowed electric guitar, but on the National tri-plate acoustic it produces strange overtones and complex harmonics that shift, bend and mutate as the fan is applied at different angles to differente combinations of strings. This results in a suite of strikingly unique drone pieces which have a specific alien resonance that immediately sets them apart from most other drone musics produced with analog or digital methods. Of course, Cooper cannot help but fill out these drone compositions with his live-sampling and looping techniques, producing several long-form pieces that gradually build up layers of hypnotic drone at different tones and pitches, building up an immersive sonic atmosphere.\"",

            "about": "A series of long distance acoustic guitar duo collaborations made during the 2020 Covid pandemic via file sharing between Cooper in Valencia, Spain and Jim McAuley in Los Angeles. Cooper met McAuley via Jim's cd Second Earth with Lap Steel Guitarist Scot Ray on the LongSong record label.\nGuitarist Jim McAuley - described as “the only guitarist who has played with Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Nels Cline”, Jim has been integral to Los Angeles creative music scene for over 30 years. After a brief stint as a commercial session musician in the early 70’s, he began focusing on his original solo material, quickly landing a contract with John Fahey’s Takoma label in 1976. In the eighties he gravitated toward free improv and was honored to perform and record with such LA legends as John Carter, Horace Tapscott and James Newton. He earned his MFA at CalArts in ‘91 (mentored by Frederick Rzewski, David Behrman and others) and in ‘94 formed a collective called Gongfarmer whose revolving roster included Alex Cline, Jeff Gauthier, Marty Walker, David Johnson and other Los Angeles new music stalwarts. 2001 saw the release of “Acoustic Guitar Trio”–Nels Cline, (the late) Rod Poole and Jim McAuley–on Derek Bailey’s Incus imprint. He has several more recent.d. releases on the Italian Long Song record label. This is his first collaboration with Mike Cooper.\nReview - \"Jim McAuley & Mike Cooper, \"Fragile Corners\" Two acoustic guitarists obsessed with grain and spontaneity share expressions continents apart, though sounding as if they're in the same room. The coarse slides, buzzing plucks and piquant minglings remind us that humans are physical objects vibrating to unseen forces. 20 min. Listen/buy here. - Metal Jazz.",

            "about": "These duet improvisations were made by file sharing between California and Spain. They could be viewed/heard as pieces made by reacting to an audible graphic score maybe? Mike sent his improvisation to Jon and he reacted to / or interpreted what he heard and returned his files to mix with Mike's guitar files. Mike's pieces were recorded in various locations, mostly hotel rooms when on tour and even outdoors on a couple of pieces with a Zoom H2 portable recorder. Jon's pieces were recorded at his home studio.\nJon plays Baritone Saxophone and voice. Mike plays a Yamaha acoustic travel guitar.\nMike writes - \"I have long been a fan of the Rova Saxophone Quartet and was pleasantly surprised when playing at a folk club (?) in London a couple of years ago to look up and see Jon sitting in the audience. He was in London on holiday and happened to see my name in a listing and bothered to find the gig. Not an easy task as I had trouble myself. We have since met similarly on a couple of occasions in different cities but have never played live together and so to meet virtually like this is a great pleasure.\"\nJon writes - \"since being in the same place at the same time long enough to play together wasn't working out when Mike suggested I work with Duck Baker remotely I replied that we should try it out first. I had played around with layered improvisations with my Jon Raskin Quartet and liked the form of considered tracks to consider what to do.\"",

            "about": "In February 2019 I was commissioned by the University of Venice to present a live soundtrack for L’Inhumaine to be screened as part of a seminar titled FASHION APERTURA: UCHRONIA AND UTOPIAN FASHION presented by Alessandra Vaccari, Università IUVA di Venezia, and Caroline Evans, Central Saint Martins College, University of the Arts London at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice.\nMy soundtrack for the original live performance in Venice was based on the rhythms heard here but I have re-worked them and added what would have been improvised during that live screening adding treated lap steel guitar and small synthesisers hoping to ‘make the light sing’.\nDarius Milhaud was commissioned for the original live score (since lost) for the film and I took his brief for a percussion heavy score for my presentation.\nThe rhythms I use reflect a nostalgic look back to the early 1980s and early 90's in the UK when we first heard the (so called ‘jungle rhythms’) drum and bass that appeared from the pirate radio stations of the young Caribbean and Asian communities in London.\nDuring that period (early 80's) I had a group with keyboard player Pat Thomas, saxophonist Tim Hill and a turntable player Neil Palmer called The Mayhem Quartet. We played improvised music across deconstructed electronic dance rhythms influenced by the drum and bass that we heard around us.\nTrystero System was a member-fluctuating duo that I had with a similar approach to improvised music. Both groups music then (and now here) reflected our common interest in the music of the time coming from dub masters such as King Tubby and Lee Perry and later the dub mixes of Paul “Groucho” Smykle and his work with, for instance, the reggae group Black Uhuru and the polyrhythmic Nigerian ‘Juju’ music of King Sunny Ade.\nL’Inhumaine is a 1924 French drama-science fiction film directed by Marcel L’Herbier; it has the subtitle histoire féerique (“fairy story”, “story of enchantment”). It was notable for its experimental techniques and for the collaboration of many leading practitioners in the decorative arts, architecture and music.\nThe plot of the film was a melodrama with strong elements of fantasy, but from the outset L’Herbier’s principal interest lay in the style of filming: he wanted to present “a miscellany of modern art” in which many contributors would bring different creative styles into a single aesthetic goal. In this respect L’Herbier was exploring ideas similar to those outlined by the critic and film theorist Ricciotto Canudo who wrote a number of texts about the relationship between cinema and the other arts, proposing that cinema could be seen as “a synthesis of all the arts”. L’Herbier also foresaw that his film could provide a prologue or introduction to the major exhibition Exposition des Arts Décoratifs which was due to open in Paris in 1925. With this in mind, L’Herbier invited leading French practitioners in painting, architecture, fashion, dance and music to collaborate with him.\nOne evening of location shooting became famous (4 October 1923). For the scene of Claire Lescot’s concert L’Herbier hired the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées and invited over 2000 people from the film world and fashionable society to attend in evening dress and to play the part of an unruly audience. Ten cameras were deployed around the theatre to record their reactions to the concert. This included the American pianist George Antheil performing some of his own dissonant compositions which created a suitably confrontational mood, and when Georgette Leblanc appeared on stage the audience responded with the required tumult of whistles, applause and protests, as well as some scuffles. The audience is said to have included Erik Satie, Pablo Picasso, Man Ray, Léon Blum, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and the Prince of Monaco.\nA wide range of practitioners in different fields of the arts worked on the film, meeting L’Herbier’s ambition of creating a film which united many forms of artistic expression. Four designers contributed to the sets. The painter Fernand Léger created the mechanical laboratory of Einar Norsen. The architect Robert Mallet-Stevens designed the exteriors of the houses of Norsen and Claire Lescot, with strong cubist elements. Autant-Lara was responsible for the winter-garden set and the funeral vault, while Cavalcanti designed the geometric dining hall for Claire’s party, with its dining-table set on an island in the middle of a pool. Costumes were designed by Paul Poiret, furniture by Pierre Chareau and Michel Dufet, jewellery by Raymond Templier, and other “objets” by René Lalique and Jean Puiforcat. The choreographed scenes were provided by Jean Börlin and the Ballets Suédois. To bind the whole together L’Herbier commissioned the young Darius Milhaud to write a score with extensive use of percussion, to which the images were to be edited. This musical score which was central to L’Herbier’s conception of the film has not survived. The final sequence of the film, in which Claire is ‘resurrected’, is an elaborate exercise in rapid cutting, whose expressive possibilities had recently been demonstrated in La Roue. In addition to the juxtaposition and rhythmic repetition of images, L’Herbier interspersed frames of bright colours, intending to create counterpoint to the music of Milhaud and “to make the light sing”.",

It goes inside my electronics flight case. I was invited to play at the film festival on the Greek island of Syros in 2015 where these two pieces were recorded live. The first track was for the opening ceremony to welcome everyone and the second piece was a live soundtrack to a short black and white silent film titled Portrait De La Grece (Portrait Of Greece) These long slow music pieces were inspired by guitarist Henry Kaiser kindly sending me his five c.d. box set of live solo guitar pieces Garden Of Memory. The title of the first track owes its origin to Nathaniel Mackey.",

            "about": "This album first appeared as a digital download on Room40 records called New Guitar, Old Hat, Knew Blues. It was an edited version of this live recording from the venue Cave 12 in Geneva Switzerland. This is the complete concert as it unfolded.\nFrom the mid 70's I almost exclusively played lap steel guitar - fretting the instrument with a steel bar and as fingers on frets became redundant another world of instruments that involved sliding something ( almost anything) up and down strings to produce glorious glissando appeared. Hawaiian, African, Greek, Thai, Chinese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese and many other of the worlds music has instruments that involves this technique and all of them have to some extent influenced the music you hear here.\nFor almost all my musical life I have played a 1930's metal bodied National Tri-Plate resonator guitar, an instrument designed by Slovakian American John Dopyera, initially for Hawaiian musicians as a lap steel instrument. Recently I wanted to have an instrument to travel with on holidays and longer trips that was small, light and 'cabin-able' on aircraft (although I always carry my instruments on board whenever possible) and I purchased a wooden bodied Yamaha short scale travel guitar, the first wooden bodied guitar I have owned for many years. The experience of a new instrument (like a new tuning) always seems to uncover new music, waiting to be discovered, hidden within. This small travel instrument also seemed to invite a return to playing with fingers on frets as well a steel or bottleneck, although I wasn't about to revisit nostalgic musical territory with it. I am an improvisor and although there are 'songs' here they are all musically improvised with only the text having some pre-formed essence, and they are produced using a William Burroughs/Brion Gyson cut-up technique on a couple of Thomas Pynchon novels, which has produced a body of work of about 35 'songs' that I call Spirit Songs. Every performance of Spirit Songs is different.\nIn the winter of 2016 I took the new instrument and some songs out for a short European tour and in Switzerland, at Cave12 in Geneva, I was fortunate enough to have Eleonora Puzzle as my sound person who recorded my set. I thank her and Sixto and all who attended that night and made the recording and music possible. What you hear is what they heard that night in its entirety apart from the first five minutes or so while I was warming up which I have saved for another occasion.\nmike cooper / rome /valencia - 2021",

            "about": "The UK’s network of crumbling sound mirrors - an early form of radar - supply cues for blues experimenter Mike Cooper and pivotal improvisor Mark Wastell (Company) in an inquisitive collaboration on Wastell’s Confront Recordings. The strange, austere relics of WWI were erected between 1916 and the 1930s and are found dotted along the South East and North East coastline of England, sometimes in farmer’s fields who’ll let you in for a look if you ask nicely (out to my guy in Boulby). With Cooper manning lapsteel guitar and electronics, and Wastell on paiste 32” tam tam, percussion and shruti box, the pair conure a psychedelic, airborne sound that recalls a mixture of frayed, early electronics and messed-up recordings of the blues seemingly dialled in from another dimension, using their ears as concrete receptors for sferic and alien ephemeral sounds which, at their darkest in the final track ‘Boulby’ (they’re all named after locations of sound mirrors), which appears to be channelling sounds from the super deep mines below where experimental research is conducted for space travel, somewhat echoing the use of the land above, some 100 years prior.

            "about": "Recorded live at the Venice Biennale in the French Pavilion where we were artists in residence. The French pavilion for the Venice Art Biennale 2017 was transformed by French artist Xavier Veilhan and the pavilion’s curators, Christian Marclay and Lionel Bovier, into a musical space where professional musicians from all over the world were invited to work throughout the duration of the Biennale. This is one of three sessions that I did during the period of a week, The other two were with Spanish Cello player Dr.Truna and British keyboards player Pat Thomas. Mazen is from Lebanon but lives in Berlin.. All three sessions were improvised versions on my Glass Love installation/composition. -\nyoutu.be/ugLef5z9sbM\nyoutu.be/AAtlJAX4j34\nMazen and I met when the Irtijal Festival invited me to play in Beirut. i visited Beirut several times and Mazen suggested that I make a solo record (Radio Paradise) for the Al Maslak record label which he co-founded. We first played together in Mexico at the El Nicho festival. It was a pleasure to invite him to participate in this residency in Venice.",

            "about": "Recorded live at the Venice Biennale in the French Pavilion where we were artists in residence. The French pavilion for the Venice Art Biennale 2017 was transformed by French artist Xavier Veilhan and the pavilion’s curators, Christian Marclay and Lionel Bovier, into a musical space where professional musicians from all over the world were invited to work throughout the duration of the Biennale. This is one of three sessions that I did during the period of a week, The other two were with Spanish Cello player Dr.Truna and Lebanese Trumpet player Mazen.. All three sessions were improvised versions on my Glass Love installation/composition. Venetus is Latin for Sea Blue.\nyoutu.be/ugLef5z9sbM\nyoutu.be/AAtlJAX4j34\nPat Thomas and I have been collaborating together since the early 1980s. We had a quartet with sax player Tim Hill and a dj Neil Palmer called Mayhem Quartet in the 80s. and one of my first incarnations of Trystero System was with Pat. We both share a love of electronics, Sun Ra, Reggae and Dub and Experimental Music of all kinds. My love of electronics goes back to these sources and Silver Apples Of The Moon is a favourite of mine.\nAs a keyboard player Pat can be heard on several of my earlier recordings and was a member of my Continental Drift band. Hear him on my c.d. Island Songs.",

            "about": "Playing With Water is a novel written by James Hamilton-Paterson. I was introduced to his writing by the Australian poet Peter Bakowski who gave me a copy of his book ‘Seven Tenths - The Sea And Its Thresholds’; a book that influ- enced my record Globe Notes and subsequent works immensely. Another of his books ‘Playing With Water: Passion And Solitude On A Philippine Island’ is about exactly what the title describes it as and provided me with the title.\nThe first edition on my Hipshot c.d.r label in 1999 was titled Kiribati and was dedicated to the people of that Pacific Island nation as I shared their concern, then as now, with the fact of rising sea levels due to global warming which threatens to destroy or make uninhabitable their low lying island homes. That album was the start of a long musical and artistic journey for me.\nIn the years that followed I have visited many places around the North and South Pacific, South East Asia and The Caribbean that are also in danger of being inundated as water levels rise, both coastal and inland, due to melting ice or weather patterns that change drastically bringing untypical amounts of rainfall.\nCities such as Venice, Bangkok, Jakarta, London, Manhattan or any coastal, or near a major river, city will be sub- ject to serious flooding and subsidence and may well become uninhabitable in the same way in the very near future.\nBangkok was previously known as ‘The Venice Of South East Asia’ and its now roads were once canals. I have been in that city during the monsoon season and seen water coming up through the floor of shops and houses exiting to the street through the door. Jakarta is currently sinking at such an alarming rate that the Indonesian Government is building a new capital city in Kalimantan (Borneo)\nSeveral of my albums subsequent to Kiribati - Globe Notes, Rayon Hula, Reluctant Swimmer/Virtual Surfer, Fratello Mare, Raft, Oceanic Feeling-Like (with Chris Abrahams) and now Playing With Water are all conceptually con- cerned with this same subject.\nAnother conceptual thread connecting them is my concern for the co-habitation of the human and non-human world expressed through my use of unprocessed avian or insect field recordings of song, signs and signals. Cli- mate change, as well as the destruction by humans of the natural habitat of many species, is disturbing the bal- anced relationship we need to have with nature. Indigenous and small, often nomadic, coastal communities are very aware of this balance and the incursion of the industrial world into their way of life is having disastrous effects which will ( if not already ) have similar effects and repercussions on ours.\nThere are field recordings on this edition from Pulau Ubin, Ko Phayan, Ko Lanta, Sri Lanka, Bangkok, St.Lucia and Martinique; all places that can look forward to or are already witnessing the Postdiluvian Future.\nWe could quite possibly all be looking forward to an island existence in that future where all of our cities, or We- tropolis, will be floating worlds of Aquatecture and Aquaculture will provide all our food, powered by wind, solar or mechanical energy from the tides and the waves. Oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth’s surface making it the worlds largest solar collector - Seven Tenths\nIn 1957 the Rio Turia that ran through the city flooded to such an extent, killing 60 people, that it was diverted to the south and what was the riverbed turned into a park which runs through the centre and surrounds the old part of the city. Within a few weeks after finishing recording this collection in my studio in Valencia the city experienced the biggest storm recorded in over a hundred years. Within a day the normally 135 metre wide, several kilometres long, Malvarosa beach and the 10 metre paseo and road beyond it was completely flooded, as were the restaurants lining it. After cleaning and repairs some weeks later they re-opened only to be closed again two weeks after by the pandemic and subsequent lockdown in which I am now writing this.\nMy guitar playing here, as always, draws on a number of styles and genres influenced by Hawaiian Slack Key and Lap Steel guitar.\n++\nMike Cooper - Playing With Water\nSide One\n1a - Baarish ke Baad (Sri Lanka After Rain)\n2a - Bankocalypse\n3a - The Drowned World (Jalan Batu After Rain)\nSide Two\n1b - Lost Steps\n2b - Aquatecture\n3b - Wetropolis (Jalan Durian)\nRecorded at The Steelworks - Rome/Valencia 2019/2020",

            "about": "Back in another parrallel lifetime, century, planet maybe, I sang songs in front of people, often with just an acoustic guitar. These are some of the songs that I love to sing. They were all recorded live even if there was no audience at the time, and recorded in different locations and at different times, some years apart, on different devices. So this is time travelling as well. Call them Folk Songs maybe? They are all protest songs as are most of the songs that I sing...and would still..in the right time and place.",

            "about": "One of my favourite records in my output. Recorded in Beirut/Lebanon over a couple of days at Tunefork Studios on May 25th and December 14th 2010. I am playing my Alan Timmins carbon fibre resophonic tri-cone guitar acoustic and through various digital devices on all but two tracks which are played on my 1932 National try-cone.. No overdubs all one take.\nal-Mu'tamid Muhammad ibn Abbad Ibn Ismail al-Lakhmi was the third and last ruler of the taifa of Seville in Al-Andalus and one of the most eminent men of 11th-century al-Andalus, highly regarded as a writer of poetry in Arabic. He was taken into captivity by the Almoravids and exiled to Aghmat, Morocco, where he died,or was perhaps assassinated, in 1095.\nProduced for Johnny Kafta - Kids Menu with art work by Mazen Kerbaj. Thanks to Ziad Michel Nawfal, Sharif Sehnaoui and Fadi Tabbal. .",

Instead we decided to do a 'live stream' from Grayson's apartment in Ballina. I played a virtual digital steel guitar app on my iPhone, a mini Kaos Pad, a Samsung tablet and a long delay pedal, while Grayson manipulated video from his Unsettled audio visual installation (for which I did the music) that was being show in Adelaide at the same time.",

            "about": "This was a live concert recording from the Controindicazione Festival of Improvised Music in 2003 in Rome. The first half is played on Mike's old 1930s National tri-plate lapsteel guitar and the second half on his Vietnamese electric lap steel.He also sings two songs along the way. ‘’Movies is Magic’’ and “Dolphins”.. It was the first time Mike had ever sung the last song and the first time singing in an improvised music concert.\nReally can’t think of many other 78 year old guitarists whose music still feels somehow relevant thru it’s sheer, expressive abstraction nowadays. And this recording proves; Mike Cooper is pretty special.\n'Floating in out of the exotic ether and disappearing like smoke, engulfed in the alien hugeness of nature... a very elegant set by a visionary artist.'\nHear it as it was played in this digital version as a complete set with no break.\nCover art work by Evan Crankshaw.",

                    "about": "This was a live concert recording from the Controinicazione Festival of Improvised Music in 2003 in Rome. The first half is played on Mike's old 1930s National tri-plate lapsteel guitar and the second half on his Vietnamese electric lap steel.He also sings two songs along the way. ‘’Movies is Magic’’ and “Dolphins”.. It was the first time Mike had ever sung the last song and the first time hesang in an improvised music concert.\nReally can’t think of many other 78 year old guitarists whose music still feels somehow relevant thru it’s sheer, expressive abstraction nowadays. And this recording proves; Mike Cooper is pretty special.\n'Floating in out of the exotic ether and disappearing like smoke, engulfed in the alien hugeness of nature... a very elegant set by a visionary artist.'\nHear it as it was played in this digital version as a complete set with no break.\nCover art work by Evan Crankshaw.",

            "about": "Recorded direct to digital at the Flamingo Studio in Valencia November 2023.\nKIKA KILA\nKIKA KILA is the Hawaiian name for lap steel guitar a guitar innovation invented at the end of the 19th Century by a Hawaiian school boy named Joseph Kekuku. He revolutionised the guitar and prepared it to take over 20th Century music world wide. Joseph’s invention was to first of all string his guitar with steel strings, then raise the strings from the finger board by means of a raised nut, the place where the strings come from the tuning pegs onto the finger board, and to then, instead of playing the guitar in the conventional manner, he laid it flat across his knees and in his left hand he held a small metal bar which he slide up and down the strings to play melodies. He also invented finger picks; thimble like pieces of metal which he wore on the ends of the fingers on his right hand, and a thumb pick. This made the sound louder when he plucked the strings. No one had ever done this before Joseph Kekuku did it. It was a revolution in terms of guitar playing and was a technical, mechanical and artistic achievement by someone considered by American and Europeans as being uncivilised, illiterate and in Christian terms, in need of his soul saving.\nHis invention and the music he made with it combined with the creative and artistic talents of his fellow Hawaiians spread, first of all around America and then the world during the first part of the 20th Century. It became the ‘trade mark’ of Hawaiians and was symbolic and an icon of Hawaiian resistance. Resistance to the colonial and empirical forces of the United States. Soon after Joseph’s revolution on January 17th 1893 a group of American sugar planters under Sanford Ballard Dole overthrew Queen Liliuokalani, the Hawaiian monarch, and establish a new provincial government with Dole as president. An act considered, even by the American Government at the time, illegal.\nHawaiian resistance to this situation took the form of an immediate revival of the Hawaiian language (which had been suppressed by Calvinist Missionaries) mainly through song and dance. The Hula, a sacred dance for Hawaiians, and Mele (songs, chants and poetry) were performed, even for white non-Hawaiian audiences, in private and in public, but took on a form of resistance as new hula and mele were written and performed. Prior to the arrival of Europeans Hawaiian culture was oral. They had no written language and knowledge was transmitted through cultural exchange. Hula is a dance form with poetry and information transmitted by movement. New Mele were written and performed in Hawaiian and as most non Hawaiians had little or no knowledge of the language, they failed to understand the hidden messages of resistance in both the songs and the dance. The result was a Hawaiian unity that spread around the world and even to other Pacific Nations.\nAt the start of the 20th century and until the 1930’s the then early recording industry recorded and sold more Hawaiian music than any other genre. Joseph Kekuku’s invention by then had spread around the world and had ‘colonised’ all forms and genre of music. His invention led, indirectly, to the invention of the first electric guitar, which was a Hawaiian guitar, which in its turn ‘colonised’ the rest of the world.\nIn a communication to the State of Hawai‘i dated February 25, 2018 from Dr. Alfred M. deZayas, a United Nations Independent Expert, the UN official acknowledged the prolonged occupation of the Hawaiian Kingdom. He wrote: “As a professor of international law, the former Secretary of the UN Human Rights Committee, co-author of the book, The United Nations Human Rights Committee Case Law 1977-2008, and currently serving as the UN Independent Expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order, I have come to understand that the lawful political status of the Hawaiian Islands is that of a sovereign nation-state that is under a strange form of occupation by the United States resulting from an illegal military occupation and a fraudulent annexation. As such, international laws (the Hague and Geneva Conventions) require that governance and legal matters within the occupied territory of the Hawaiian Islands must be administered by the application of the laws of the occupied state (in this case, the Hawaiian Kingdom), not the domestic laws of the occupier (the United States).”\nThe statement is relevant, as we enter 2024, to a situation similar to the one described above being perpetrated at the other end of the sea from where I write this.\nTwo relevant and essential books - Noise Uprising - The Audio Politics of A World Music Revolution by Michael Denning\nKika Kila - How The Hawaiian Steel Guitar Changed The Sound Of Modern Music by John W Troutman.\nMike Cooper / January 2024 / Valencia-Spain.",

            "about": "EXPLORING THE ARCHIVE - In 1999 I started publishing cd.r records on my Hipshot Editions for ten years. Some of them have been re-released recently as vinyl l.p.s.\nSEND OF THE SEA – HIP 023 (2007)\nTwo tracks recorded live one in Rome and the other in Wellington in New Zealand. ‘ Send Of The Sea’ and ‘The Return Of Shadows’.\n\" The Return Of Shadows was recorded live at The British School in Rome as part of the ‘Tracks’ series organised by Daniela Cascella. It was a concert shared with Keith Rowe where we both played solo spots and then a duo version of a page of the score ‘Treatise’ by Cornelius Cardew. 'The Return Of Shadows' is my solo piece. It is played on my self-made instrument I call a La’ap ( a cross between a Hawaiian guitar and a small South East Asian harp) and some ambient field recordings that I made in Pulau Pangkor in Malaysia at xmas 2000.\nThe title comes from film director Raul Ruiz’s book Poetics Of Cinema. In it he writes ” ‘Light, more light’ were Goethe’s dying words. ‘Less light, less light’ cried Orsen Wells repeatedly…In todays cinema (and in today’s world) there is too much light. It is time to return to the shadows.”\nThe composer Alvin Curran who attended the concert described my solo set as “..almost unbearably stable sandwiched layers of polyphony..”\n'Send Of The Sea' is a live recording I made accompanying some films at ‘Happy’ a club in Wellington. I took the recording home to my studio in Rome and did some post production making a dub piece of it. It was all played on my 1930’s acoustic National Resophonic Tri-Plate guitar…not that you would know!!\nThe ‘Send Of The Sea’ is the title of a piece written by Australian writer Odette Snellen about surfing.\n‘Surfers equate the tremendous noise heard inside the wave (green room) to silence; a deafening sensaround roar so intense it blocks out everything else.’ Jack Friday-Torquay Surf Museum.",

In keeping with my usual aesthetic of 'cheap and small and portable as possible' I used a Samsung 7 inch tablet running two or three music apps (downloaded for free) and a Zoom portable recorder to do the job. What you hear is what I heard and hopefully my fellow passengers didn't. The only edits are beginnings and endings of the pieces. They were made using headphones and unless you have a super hi-fi system I recommend listening to them on headphones.\nI dont know how long the cover will stay up so get it before they make me take it down :-)\nThe work is dedicated to Bob Ostertag who's music I have listened to since the release of Fall Mountain in 1979 and to Morton Subotnick who's recording Silver Apples Of The Moon provided me with many samples during my time with The Recedents in the 1980's and 90's and last but by no means last Warren Burt a constant source of inspiration.\nThanks to Lawrence English for help with the cover.",

            "about": "These beats were originally made for my live accompaniment to the silent film L’Inhumaine by Marcel L’Herbier (1924)\nI was commissioned by the University of Venice to present it as part of a seminar titled Fashion Apertura: Uchronia And Utopian Fashion presented by Alessandra Vaccari and Caroline Evans at Palazzo Grassi in Venice in 2019.\nComposer Darius Milhaud had been commissioned to write a score, to be played live, for the 1924 screening, however, his score has been lost and the only clue we have about it was that it was very percussive.\nTaking this clue I also made a very percussion heavy score with addition of space for me to improvise over.\nThis version here is a heavily processed version of those original beats with the addition of Lap Steel Electric guitar on top. The beats reflect my interest in the London Jungle scene of the late 80s early 90s and my obsession with Lap Steel Guitar as played in almost every musical culture in the world.",

            "about": "A soundtrack for a live cine concert screening with Frederik Murnau's 1931 film Tabu. Shot in Tahiti, this was the first live soundtrack performance that i attempted, in 1995. I have subsequently performed with this film all over the world and it remains one of my favourites. Tabu gave me an excuse to use my knowledge of Hawaiian Slack Key and Lap Steel guitar playing and to mix it with electronic music. My aim was to make a soundtrack as contemporary as the film was when it was released in 1931.I have performed it so many times that improvisation is now a large part of a live screening.",

            "about": "THE DREAM ISLAND OF BIRDS\nIn the early 90’s i was walking with Maria on a small island in Fiji and we came across someone obviously not local cleaning a boat. A short conversation led to an invitation to visit his nearby humble home a small palm thatched bamboo house a short walk from the beach. Close enough but far enough not to be immediately spotted by passers by and un-observant tourists. It was his home and his studio. He was an artist. Charles Van Sandwyk. An illustrator and story writer.\nSome years later I found an article about him in a magazine and an interview where he explained that not long after we had met he was involved in a terrible car accident on the main island of Fiji where he had gone to do some business. It had left him hospitalised for some months and during those months in hospital and on medication he had vivid dreams and one dream in particular he later illustrated. It became a small book titled The Dream Island Of Birds.\nThrough the same article I learnt that he spent half of his year in Fiji and half in Vancouver Canada where he would often rent empty shops and use them as pop-up galleries to sell his hand printed illustrated books and drawings. I had a friend in Vancouver and I sent her this information and said if she ever came across him or one of his pop up shops to go in and buy something or just say hello.\nShortly after I received a message back from her saying that she had been reading my letter (it was pre-internet time for us) at a bus stop and had turned around to find she was in fact standing in front one of his pop up exhibition spaces and that she had gone in and he was there. She told him our story and he remembered us visiting him. He gave her a signed postcard to send to me which has been on my studio wall for many years. It is a reproduction of a page from The Dream Island Of Birds.\nIn 2012 I spent a month as an artist in residence for The Artists Village organisation on Pulau Ubin a small island between Singapore and Malaysia. One of the most profound months of my life. I made hours of recordings while there mostly of birds and insects. Pulau Ubin has over 300 resident or passing species of birds. This a mix of some of those recordings, digitally processed, and electronics. My ‘Dream Island Of Birds’. I have chosen as titles for the pieces some of the more exotically named of the 300. They are not recordings of the actual birds named and in fact one track is not of live birds at all but is a dream bird dreamt in the digital realm.",

            "about": "A split live set recorded in Rome 2023. First set acoustic Lap Steel guitar. Second set my DNA (Digital Nomadic Art) sound performance.\nThe first set was 60 years in the making. The result of 60 years of research and practicing the art of Lap Steel Guitar playing. I started in the late 1950s playing Bottleneck/Slide, Country/Rural blues then one day in Reading, the town I was born in, an American traveller passing through showed me how to play Lap Steel guitar in open tuning. He played and sang ‘Wasn’t That A Mighty Storm’ a song credited to one Sin Killer Griffin which references the Galveston flood of around 1900.\nI began to research the history of Lap Steel Guitar; first to Hawaii where Joseph Kekuku who in the late 1880s is credited with being the first musician to adapt his acoustic guitar and to play it with a slide, inventing lap steel style. Hawaiian musicians, including Kekuku, recorded playing lap steel in the early 1900’s and toured extensively in mainland America, Europe and eventually Asia. These touring musicians, as well as sailors who played music and the distribution of early recordings helped spread the instrument worldwide. It spread not only this revolutionary style of guitar playing but also the vernacular music that became the sound track to another revolution. The revolution of independence in the colonies. For instance Hawaiian musicians began to sing in their own language instead of English and many of the songs were songs of place extolling the beauty of their native lands stolen by Americans, with hidden messages and double entendre of resistance embedded in the lyrics. It should be noted that the first ever electric guitars were Lap Steel Guitars and were played by Hawaiian musicians. The Noelani Hawaiian Orchestra recorded the first electric Lap Steel Guitar in 1933 playing The Lei Vendor a song written by Johnny Noble\nKroncong in Indonesia took up the same idea helping speed independence from the Dutch by fostering unity and resistance through the music. In Greece Rembetika, which emerged from the working class in the 1920’s has had several revivalist moments as different imperial powers, political movements and wars crossed Greece as recently as the economic crisis of 2009.\nOver those 60 years I became aware of Lap Steel being played in India, Myanmar, Greece, Indonesia, Russia, Africa and many other musical cultures and each one has contributed to my improvisations here, although no direct musical reference to any one of them is utilised or intended. One ingredient I took from them all was improvisation which seems to be a necessary part of them all.\nThese improvisations were recorded live in front of an invited audience in Rome at Folderol Studios in 2023. The first set is played on my F1 Resophonic acoustic guitar and the second set of electronic music is played on an iPad Mini, a Samsung tablet and an iPhone 6, ending with a song , which has nothing to do with Lap Steel Guitar, but is part of my current live and recorded musical direction.\nSome of my musical influences on these pieces - Brij Bushan Kabra, Sonny Sharrock, U Tin, Tau Moe, Elliott Sharp, Rudy Waikato, Kostas Bezos, Scot Ray, Ornette Coleman, Sam Ku West, Lol Coxhill, Pat Thomas, Morton Subotnik, Bob Ostertag, Bob Dylan, Sun Ra, Henry Kaiser and Alvin Curran to name but a few.",

            "about": "Tradition and Innovation in Lap Steel Guitar\nAround 1889 Hawaiian musician Joseph Kekuku discovered a new way to play the guitar with a metal bar. He had invented the Lap Steel Guitar. He raised the strings away from the finger board to eliminated noise from the bar as it travelled across the frets and he invented metal finger picks to increase the volume from his guitar. Glissando guitar.\nThis set is an homage to him and an homage to the island of Maui in Hawaii home of the volcano Haleakala.\nMy pieces all feature an older style of playing lap steel combined with new techniques and new digital technology. Much like Joseph Kekuku introduced into the genre with his new inventions.\nTradition and innovation in Lap Steel Guitar playing. Glissando guitars.\nThe titles are all places that I have visited and names of people that I met and know on Maui.\nUnder The Volcano is a novel written by Malcom Lowry but the volcano in my title is Haleakala on Maui not those in his novel which are in Mexico.\nDedicated to Carter ‘Fig’ Pyle, Uncle Sol, Richard and Solomon Ho’opi’i, Angie Pegrum, Frannie Cooper, Laura Pyle.",

            "about": "Singer Viv Corringham and I have a long history of making music together as a duo which has covered a lot ground and genre from Free Improvisation to Avant Folk and Blues. This live concert at Cafe Oto was a shared evening with Andy Moor and Yannis Kiriakides. Both duos play our avant guard version of Greek Rembetika which is often called Greek Blues, which refers to a feeling rather than a musical construction.\nBoth Viv and I have our own separate musical lives and we come together only occasionally for these projects these days. Whenever we do it is always an inspiration and pleasure.\nRead more about Viv and Singing, Walking, Listening here -  vivcorringham.org\nAnd then join us for an unusual cross cultural voyage around the Mediterranean and watch for more later..

I think we invented the genre Rembetronika, although others have picked up on it. We began to explore the possibilities of expanding on our love of Greek Rembetika music and pushing it into outer space on our Avant Roots c.d. recorded in 1993 (coming soon on Bandcamp) - We have toured intermittently with it over the years since then and this is our where it was last time we took it out.",

            "about": "In 2012 I was invited to live for a month, from May 6th until June 6th, as an ‘artists in residence’ on Pulau Ubin by The Artists Village (TAV) group based in Singapore.\nMy initial ‘project’ idea was to make a ‘sound map’ of the island. Places which I had visited and made field recordings where others could visit and have a similar listening experience. At the time I had never spent a month (almost) alone in a house in a tropical jungle. I say almost alone because I shared the residency with Japanese artist Yuzuru Maeda. Yuzuru is such a quiet person that I often felt I was alone.\nOn my initial visit to Ubin I was impressed by the number and the volume of the different sounds of birds, insects, electrical generators, boats and aircraft taking of from nearby Chiangi airport and, mostly at night, the thunder storms. I decided I would spend my month walking and making sound recordings from which I would produce a c.d. and my sound map of the various “listening sites’ where I made the recordings.\nI decided to walk partly because I noticed most visitors to the island hired bicycles to get around. Understandable if you have limited time and the heat and humidity isn’t conducive to walking for most people.\nPulau Ubin is the second largest off shore island located off the North Eastern end of Singapore, between Singapore and Malaysia. It is a granite island with an area of 1020 hecters with low lying mangroves and tidal rivers. Originally it was five small islands which were bound together for prawn farming forming a single island known as Pulau Ubin, meaning ‘Tile Island’ in Malay and Indonesian.\nThe island had been a forgotten backwater for many years but due to the limited land mass on the Singapore Island it came onto the radar for redevelopment by the government in the 1980s and a process of resettling the villagers to Singapore main island began. However some preferred to remain as long as they could on Pulau Ubin until the redevelopment commenced, particularly the older generation.\nAt the beginning of 2000 there was public protest, particularly from groups of ‘nature deprived’ Singaporeans,as well as from the remaining inhabitants. Toward the final stages of resettlement the biodiversity of the Chek Jawa wetlands and the rich marine life of the coastal areas became apparent and the government took an interest in improving the amenities on the island; paved roads, built shelters, information kiosks and a visitor centre at Chek Jawa .\nBy 2009 there were less than 45 families still living in Ubin and, for the moment, Pulau Ubin is a living example of a former rural way of life which will most likely disappear with the last of its “kampong” generation passing. It has also become a haven for birds (there are around 400 different species) and other wild life, such as monkeys, wild boar, snakes, lizards and insects.\nI have and continue to use these field recordings in a collaborative manner in my live performances preferring not to process them in any way but let them speak for themselves.",

            "about": "Another album from the archive. First released on the Rhiannon label in 1995. Mark Makin plays the lead guitar parts on most of the tunes and I play lap steel and bottleneck as well as sharing the vocals with Viv Corringham. Saxophonist Lol Coxhill also makes a guest appearance.\nNational Gallery toured Europe in the nineties with our most memorable tour being in the former East Germany 1996 during the weeks previous to the fall of the Communist government there. With assumed names and borrowed East German I.D. cards we toured with members of the New Forum dissident group pursued for most of the tour by the Stasi secret police, who were not so secret it appeared at the time.\nThe name of the group comes from the instruments we featured - our National Resophonic guitars. Mark is probably the worlds authority on these vintage instruments and his book Palm Trees, Senoritas and Rocket Ships, which he wrote, illustrated and published himself, is the 'bible' of these art deco objects and anyone with even a passing interest in guitars should own it.\nwww.markmakin.co.uk\nUnlike myself and Viv, Mark has never been a professional musician but this album testifies to his ability should he ever had wanted to be and it has always been a pleasure knowing and working with him and adding some glissando guitar here and there.\nThe material covers most of the different styles of the acoustic blues we have been interested in and was the last time that I recorded any of this kind of material.\nBoth Viv and myself have moved through different musical journeys over the years but still come together occasionally to collaborate on mutually interesting projects. Check out our Rembetronica project and Avant Roots also on Bandcamp.\nmike cooper - 2021",

            "about": "The origins of my music are in finger picking North American folk music and Afro American blues which I began playing in the late 1950's. I pursued this and then songwriting into the early 70's and then I discovered Hawaiian music and the world of American free jazz and the European free improvised music scene,which altered my perception of the guitar totally, especially as a solo instrument. Apart from my first few formative years of learning guitar standard European tuning never became a part of my technique. I immersed myself instead in 'open tunings' once I realised their global significance and in particular Hawaiian Slack Key guitar playing. In a way i see this set a type of Avant Slack Key, something I always anticipated finding in Hawaii but never did.\nFrom the mid 70's I almost exclusively played lap steel guitar - fretting the instrument with a steel bar and as fingers on frets became redundant another world of instruments that involved sliding something ( almost anything) up and down strings to produce glorious glissando appeared. Hawaiian, African, Greek, Thai, Chinese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese and many other of the worlds music has instruments that involves this technique and all of them have to some extent influenced the music you hear here.\nIn 2016 I wanted to have an instrument to travel with on holidays and longer trips that was small, light and 'cabin-able' on aircraft. I purchased a wooden bodied Yamaha short scale travel guitar, the first wooden bodied guitar I have owned since the very first instrument I ever had. My main instrument for most of my career has been a National Resophonic metal bodied guitar. The experience of a new instrument (like a new tuning) always seems to uncover new music, waiting to be discovered, hidden within. This small travel instrument also seemed to invite a return to playing with fingers on frets as well a steel or bottleneck, although I wasn't about to revisit nostalgic musical territory with it. I am an improvisor and although there are 'songs' here they are all musically improvised with only the text having some pre-formed essence, and were produced using a William Burroughs/Brion Gyson cut-up technique on a couple of Thomas Pynchon's novels, producing a body of work of about 35 'songs' that I call Spirit Songs. Every performance of these Spirit Songs is different as there is no pre written melodic or harmonic sequence involved.\nIn the winter of 2016 I took the new instrument and some songs out for a short european tour and in Switzerland, at Cave12 in Geneva, I was fortunate enough to have Eleonora Puzzle as my sound person who recorded my set. I thank her and Sixto and all who attended that night and made the recording and music possible. What you hear is what they heard that night in its entirety apart from the first five minutes or so while I was warming up which I have saved for another occasion.\nThis set was originally released as a digital download on Room40 Records and mastered for that edition by Lawrence English.",

                    "about": "The origins of my music are in finger picking North American folk music and Afro American blues which I began playing in the late 1950's. I pursued this and then songwriting into the early 70's and then I discovered Hawaiian music and the world of American free jazz and the European free improvised music scene,which altered my perception of the guitar totally, especially as a solo instrument. Apart from my first few formative years of learning guitar standard European tuning never became a part of my technique. I immersed myself instead in 'open tunings' once I realised their global significance and in particular Hawaiian Slack Key guitar playing. In a way i see this set a type of Avant Slack Key, something I always anticipated finding in Hawaii but never did.\nFrom the mid 70's I almost exclusively played lap steel guitar - fretting the instrument with a steel bar and as fingers on frets became redundant another world of instruments that involved sliding something ( almost anything) up and down strings to produce glorious glissando appeared. Hawaiian, African, Greek, Thai, Chinese, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese and many other of the worlds music has instruments that involves this technique and all of them have to some extent influenced the music you hear here.\nIn 2016 I wanted to have an instrument to travel with on holidays and longer trips that was small, light and 'cabin-able' on aircraft. I purchased a wooden bodied Yamaha short scale travel guitar, the first wooden bodied guitar I have owned since the very first instrument I ever had. My main instrument for most of my career has been a National Resophonic metal bodied guitar. The experience of a new instrument (like a new tuning) always seems to uncover new music, waiting to be discovered, hidden within. This small travel instrument also seemed to invite a return to playing with fingers on frets as well a steel or bottleneck, although I wasn't about to revisit nostalgic musical territory with it. I am an improvisor and although there are 'songs' here they are all musically improvised with only the text having some pre-formed essence, and were produced using a William Burroughs/Brion Gyson cut-up technique on a couple of Thomas Pynchon's novels, producing a body of work of about 35 'songs' that I call Spirit Songs. Every performance of these Spirit Songs is different as there is no pre written melodic or harmonic sequence involved.\nIn the winter of 2016 I took the new instrument and some songs out for a short european tour and in Switzerland, at Cave12 in Geneva, I was fortunate enough to have Eleonora Puzzle as my sound person who recorded my set. I thank her and Sixto and all who attended that night and made the recording and music possible. What you hear is what they heard that night in its entirety apart from the first five minutes or so while I was warming up which I have saved for another occasion.\nThis set was originally released as a digital download on Room40 Records and mastered for that edition by Lawrence English.",

            "about": "Discrepant presents the first ever vinyl release of Kiribati, the very first instalment in the acclaimed Ambient Exotica Soundscapes by veteran English experimentalist Mike Cooper.\n''This was the first release on my Hipshot c.d.r label in 1999. I wanted to create an album of imaginary soundscapes from imagined exotic places based on my travels in the Pacific Islands and South East Asia. Kiribati was the first in a series of three CDs of Ambient Exotica Soundscapes – played on lap steel, electronics, prepared guitar, sampler, live environmental recordings (from Bali, Malaysia, Australia and Italy) and acoustic and electronic percussion. (The other two are GLOBE NOTES and my award winning RAYON HULA.)\nKiribati was(and is) dedicated to the people and islands of Kiribati because they were slowly sinking into the Pacific Ocean. Although the palm trees are often 25 metres high, the islands themselves, made from gravel and sand, are only 4 or 5 metres above sea level and a rise in sea levels of just 15 centimetres, as has happened over the past 100 years due to global warming, is a disaster.\nKiribati was recorded in my studio on a four track cassette, using a Casio SK1 sampling keyboard. A tool I used for many years both for recording and live sampling.''\nMike Cooper",

            "about": "From Mike Cooper\nThis is a soundtrack for an otherwise silent film. The title of the album, and of course the film, is borrowed from my late friend Fred Hardy’s book The Religious Culture of India - Power, Love and Wisdom, considered to be one of the most important books on the subject. In this book Fred wrote...\n“In 1835 the historian Macaulay investigated whether there was anything in the traditional Indian systems of learning and education that could be used in the training of native personnel. In fairness to Mr Macaulay, we must remember that those were days long before the writings of a Tolkien or a Mervyn Peake. He came to the devastating conclusion that people who believe in oceans of milk and treacle had nothing to offer to a modern system of education. A straightforward, realistic assessment in an age that believed in science and realism! The effects were far-reaching. Traditional Indian ways of looking at the world were written off as obsolete. India was provided with three universities (Calcutta, Bombay and Madras, founded in 1857) as the hothouses to nurture a custom-built, English-speaking Indian intelligentsia. A new age began for India, and two of its inevitable consequences were the demand for independence and the production of atomic bombs and satellites by the post-independent Bhārat.”\nWikipedia explains the Ocean of Milk thus -\nIn Hindu cosmology, the Ocean of Milk (Kṣīra Sāgara in Sanscrit) is the fifth from the center of the seven oceans. It surrounds the continent known as Krauncha. According to Hindu scriptures, the devas and asuras worked together for a millennium to churn the ocean and release Amrita the nectar of immortal life. It is spoken of in the Samudra manthana chapter of the Puranas, a body of ancient Hindu legends. It is called Thirupaarkadal (Sacred Sea of Milk) in Tamil and is the place where Vishnu reclines over Shesha Naga along with his consort Lakshmi.\nIn his book Postcolonial Interruptions, Unauthorised Modernities (2017), Iain Chambers maintains that “… in the context of increasing neo-liberalisation processes of universities and scholarships, academic knowledge should no longer be considered the only legitimate mode of critically understanding the world…”. Chambers argues that \"nowadays the most interesting and sophisticated critical knowledge of the contemporary world is coming from what he calls post-colonial works of art.\"\nA Hydra is a genus of small, fresh-water organisms native to the temperate and tropical regions. Biologists are especially interested in Hydra because of their regenerative ability – they do not appear to die of old age, or indeed to age at all.\nSome long time fellow musical travellers are called upon to lend a hand on this album.\nSaxophonists Geoff Hawkins and Aaron Hawkins. Geoff is on many of my earlier records and we have known each other for over 60 years. Aaron is one of his sons.\nViv Corringham - Vocalist and ‘deep listening’ artist dedicated to walking, listening and singing all at the same time in her work which she calls Shadow Walks.   Saxophonist Tim Hill, now established in the West Country of England where he organises musical street theatre events and several small ensembles playing free improvised and composed music.\nLol Coxhill and Roger Turner, colleagues from The Recedents, an improvising music trio we had for 20 plus years, appear in a short extract from our five c.d. box set Wishing You Were Here. Lol is unfortunately no longer with us.\nI was moved to embrace how the digital, virtual, acoustic and natural worlds intersect in making this edition.",

Named for The Shades, the Reading, UK folk club where Mike Cooper regularly performed, and which housed prodigy Derek Hall—“a guitarist who could actually match Davey Graham both in technique and musical ideas” —this super rare EP was issued in 1965.\n***\nIn 2014 Paradise of Bachelors reissued iconoclastic English-born, Rome-based folk and experimental music legend Mike Cooper’s classic triptych of early 1970s avant-folk-rock records—Trout Steel (1970) and Places I Know/The Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper (1971-72)—to widespread critical acclaim, including Best New Reissue recognition from Pitchfork and Rolling Stone. But Cooper sowed the seeds of his deconstructivist music five years earlier in his rare earliest recordings, until now scarcely known and never reissued—fitting fodder for PoB’s very first Record Store Day release.\nNamed for The Shades, the Reading, UK folk club where he regularly performed, and which employed and housed guitar prodigy Derek Hall—who later played on Cooper’s 1969 debut LP Oh Really!?—the little-heard Out of the Shades EP was released in an extremely limited edition by local label Kennet Recordings in 1965 as KRS 766. The songs were recorded live to a single microphone in the kitchen/bathroom/former outhouse of Mike’s rambling Georgian apartment, on a portable Ferrograph reel-to-reel that the engineer otherwise used for “recording birds and trains.”\nBy 1965 Mike had already progressed beyond and exhausted his interest in electric Chicago blues with his first band The Blues Committee. He was now a peer of British folk scene stalwarts like Davey Graham, Wizz Jones, Bert Jansch, and John Renbourn, hosting folk nights up to five nights a week at venerable Reading and London clubs like Les Cousins, The Latin Quarter, The Elephant, and The Shades, Hall’s home base. Cooper recalls his former partner’s artistry and skill with fondness and wonder:\nDerek was a phenomenal guitar player, incredible, and he could play all of Blind Blake’s stuff note-for-note. He could actually match Davey Graham both in technique and musical ideas. It was one of those weird things that happens from time to time whereby someone does something really incredible, and there’s someone else doing the same thing somewhere else, and they are not aware of one another. Derek and Davey were one of those cases.\nOn Out of the Shades you can hear the first, faint strains of Cooper’s restless reinvention of vernacular traditions, the ways in which his reverence for the Piedmont and country blues of the American South was showing subtle signs of fraying and unraveling into the tangles of more expansive improvisatory terrain. Cooper and Hall were still very much operating within the bounds of the British folk and blues revival, as you can hear on their masterful renderings of the traditional folk-blues numbers “Darlin’” (which Derek, who likely learned it from King of Skiffle Lonnie Donegan, performs solo) and “Livin’ with the Blues” (popularized by Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee), classics populated by blind captains and drivin’ wheels.\nThose songs form the inner core of the EP, but the two performances bookending the 45, inhabiting its outer and inner edges, demonstrate how the duo was pushing gently against the bounds of folk forms. “Paul’s Song,” an original written by Cooper and “local folkie” Paul Lucas, is reminiscent of the contemporaneous work of American expat Jackson C. Frank; it features a gorgeous, minor melody that in its brittle world-weariness belies Mike’s mere twenty-three years. The helical, cascading guitar part represents Cooper’s only playing on the EP (at this point, despite his prodigious talent on his trademark National resophonic, he considered himself primarily a vocalist, and here he mostly sings and plays harmonica.) The closer “Skillet,” sung beautifully by Cooper, utterly transforms Uncle Dave Macon’s 1924 recording of “Keep My Skillet Good and Greasy.” Hall’s woozy, note-bending vamping unspools the second half of the song into an extraordinary instrumental passage full of mercury and momentum. It’s a song about extreme appetites—cooking every hour, keeping Nancy “drunk and goosey all the time” on brandy—prefiguring Cooper’s later hungry experimentation.\nA brief but brilliant intersection of two divergent artists, the Cooper and Hall duo did not last long. Mike went on to tour as a trio with Michael Chapman and Ralph McTell, and then, bowled over by avant-garde jazz, he collaborated with producer Peter Eden on his series of increasingly daring albums of “songmaking.” Derek moved back to London shortly after recording Out of the Shades, eventually settling into a quiet, reclusive life in Northumberland—no phone, no internet—where he taught guitar to locals but no longer performed. A few years ago Mike tracked him down and reestablished contact. “The last time I saw him was maybe 1967, and it’s odd, because he's playing exactly the same now as he was all those years ago,” Cooper reflects. “It was so strange. He was a million times better guitar player than I would ever be. It was like Charlie Parker, if he was alive today, playing the same thing he did in 1945.”\nIt is this internal tension between tradition and innovation that animates all great art, Out of the Shades included.\n+ First-ever reissue of Cooper’s rare first recordings and PoB’s first Record Store Day exclusive release.\n+ RIYL Mike Cooper, Michael Chapman, Jackson C.

            "about": "ALBUM NARRATIVE\nParadise of Bachelors is proud to present the first artist-sanctioned reissues—and first-ever vinyl reissues—of iconoclastic English-born, Rome-based folk and experimental music legend Mike Cooper’s classic trio of early 1970s avant-folk/rock records: Trout Steel (1970), Places I Know (1971), and The Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper (1972). The latter two titles are presented for the very first time as the definitive double album, as Cooper originally intended them to be released.\nListening to Cooper’s recordings retrospectively in sequence reveals a rangy narrative of perennial reinvention from document to document through a playful approach to the deconstruction of “folk” musics and all that gross genre signifier implies and denies. By the time the Rolling Stones invited him to join the band in the early ’60s, and he politely declined (true story; Brian Jones took the gig), he had already progressed far beyond the circumscribed bounds of their early, hip-histrionic Albionic blues. By the time he was rumored to have retired from music in the mid ’70s, disappearing from his home in Southern England into Southern Spain to become a fisherman (an amusing fiction; he suffers from seasickness), he had already moved beyond his heady homebrew of progressive, free jazz-framed songcraft into increasingly less conventionally structured frontiers of open improvisation and later, electronic composition.\nThe Machine Gun Co. band (named for the 1968 Peter Brötzmann album) coalesced around Cooper’s desire to continue the improvisatory path forged on Trout Steel in a more sustainable manner, with a steady core group of likeminded musicians able to buttress its daring, long-form improvisatory vaults with a bedrock foundation. Peter Eden (Donovan, Bill Fay, Clive Palmer) produced the historic sessions, which veered from the impeccable conceptual folk-rock artistry of Places I Know (as Cooper explains, “the secret of the title of this record is that it was meant as a kind of covers record, or an homage to some musicians and songwriters that I liked at the time, the ‘places’ in the title—I was interested in seeing if I could emulate some other people without actually sounding like them”) to the utterly singular “songmaking” deconstructions of the more radical The Machine Gun Co., wherein the band erects lapidary arrangements reminiscent of Tim Buckley, only to dismantle them into virtuosic passages of Beefheartian free-jazz scree and skronk. According to Cooper:\nWhat was initially planned was a double album, with one record played by the Machine Gun Co. and the other with arrangements by Mike Gibbs and his orchestra. Those two records were conceived as a double album aimed at covering the wide range of music I was interested in and gently leading the listener from the more accessible Places I Know, with its Mike Gibbs arrangements, into the more (for the times) extreme areas of The Machine Gun Co. That never happened, and they were released as two separate records a year apart.\nPlaces I Know/The Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper is Paradise of Bachelors’ attempt, two years in the making, to correct this historical oversight and offer this masterpiece as it was designed to be experienced, as an extraordinarily ambitious document spanning Cooper’s song-based and improvisation-based styles of the early 1970s.\n+ First-ever artist-sanctioned and vinyl reissue\n+ Includes 16 pp. chapbook with an essay by Mike Cooper, lyrics, and never published color photos\n+ Available on 150g virgin vinyl as a gatefold 2xLP, in a deluxe limited edition, as well as on gatefold CD and digital formats\n+ Vinyl edition includes digital download coupon\nwww.paradiseofbachelors.com/pob-14",

            "about": "From Mike Cooper\nPlaying With Water is a novel written by James Hamilton-Paterson. I was introduced to his writing by the Australian poet Peter Bakowski who gave me a copy of his book ‘Seven Tenths - The Sea And Its Thresholds’; a book that influenced my record Globe Notes and subsequent works immensely. Another of his books ‘Playing With Water: Passion And Solitude On A Philippine Island’ is about exactly what the title describes it as and provided me with the title.\nThe first edition on my Hipshot c.d.r label in 1999 was titled Kiribati and was dedicated to the people of that Pacific Island nation as I shared their concern, then as now, with the fact of rising sea levels due to global warming which threatens to destroy or make uninhabitable their low lying island homes. That album was the start of a long musical and artistic journey for me.\nIn the years that followed I have visited many places around the North and South Pacific, South East Asia and The Caribbean that are also in danger of being inundated as water levels rise, both coastal and inland, due to melting ice or weather patterns that change drastically bringing untypical amounts of rainfall.\nCities such as Venice, Bangkok, Jakarta, London, Manhattan or any coastal, or near a major river, city will be subject to serious flooding and subsidence and may well become uninhabitable in the same way in the very near future.\nBangkok was previously known as ‘The Venice Of South East Asia’ and its now roads were once canals. I have been in that city during the monsoon season and seen water coming up through the floor of shops and houses exiting to the street through the door. Jakarta is currently sinking at such an alarming rate that the Indonesian Government is building a new capital city in Kalimantan (Borneo)\nSeveral of my albums subsequent to Kiribati - Globe Notes, Rayon Hula, Reluctant Swimmer/Virtual Surfer, Fratello Mare, Raft, Oceanic Feeling-Like (with Chris Abrahams) and now Playing With Water are all conceptually concerned with this same subject.\nAnother conceptual thread connecting them is my concern for the co-habitation of the human and non-human world expressed through my use of unprocessed avian or insect field recordings of song, signs and signals. Climate change, as well as the destruction by humans of the natural habitat of many species, is disturbing the balanced relationship we need to have with nature. Indigenous and small, often nomadic, coastal communities are very aware of this balance and the incursion of the industrial world into their way of life is having disastrous effects which will ( if not already ) have similar effects and repercussions on ours.\nThere are field recordings on this edition from Pulau Ubin, Ko Phayan, Ko Lanta, Sri Lanka, Bangkok, St.Lucia and Martinique; all places that can look forward to or are already witnessing the Postdiluvian Future.\nWe could quite possibly all be looking forward to an island existence in that future where all of our cities, or Wetropolis, will be floating worlds of Aquatecture and Aquaculture will provide all our food, powered by wind, solar or mechanical energy from the tides and the waves. Oceans cover 70 percent of the Earth’s surface making it the worlds largest solar collector - Seven Tenths\nIn 1957 the Rio Turia that ran through the city flooded to such an extent, killing 60 people, that it was diverted to the south and what was the riverbed turned into a park which runs through the centre and surrounds the old part of the city. Within a few weeks after finishing recording this collection in my studio in Valencia the city experienced the biggest storm recorded in over a hundred years. Within a day the normally 135 metre wide, several kilometres long, Malvarrosa beach and the 10 metre paseo and road beyond it was completely flooded, as were the restaurants lining it. After cleaning and repairs some weeks later they re-opened only to be closed again two weeks after by the pandemic and subsequent lockdown in which I am now writing this.\nMy guitar playing here, as always, draws on a number of styles and genres influenced by Hawaiian Slack Key and Lap Steel guitar.",

            "about": "Mike Cooper’s output of the past half century has been described as ‘post-everything’. It’s a fitting phrase really when you consider he has been at the beating heart of so many critical musical moments. From the development of the blues touring circuit in the UK, through the growth of the folk scene and into the explosion of free improvisation that came to define a generation of UK musicians. Amidst it all, working at stitching these disparate forms into some kind of deterritorialised zone, was Mike Cooper.\nIt’s fitting then, that he explores the notion of journey on his latest full length edition. Even more fitting that he examines the vessels that carry us on journeys. With Raft, Cooper charts his interests in ambient exotica and collides it with his research into various South Pacific musical traditions. The record extends his palette considerably, stretching away from the hypnogogic flows of his master piece Rayon Hula, into a more oceanic setting. Raft 21 Guayaquil To Tully, for example, sets out a lilting rise and fall of harmony which erupts with spluttering electronics.\nSpecifically inspired by Vital Alsar and William Wills, sailors who undertook some of the 20th centuries most impressive solo voyages, Raft reflects upon the determination of the solo traveller. In a musical sense, Mike Cooper’s work of recent years has very much reflected a determined solo traveller work ethic. In his commitment to travel alone, he has developed a range of strategies that he works against as a means of surprising himself and uncovering unfamiliar sonic relations.\nThis approach has proved an incredibly fertile pursuit for Cooper, arguably producing some of his most affecting and engaging works, his Room40 albums Fratello Mare and White Shadows Of The South Seas amongst them. Raft is a vital record that sets its sights beyond the horizons of convention and in doing so reveals a perspective that is only available to lifelong voyagers such as Mike Cooper.",

            "about": "From Mike Cooper\nAmbient/Electronic/Exotica.\nAfter several trips, beginning in 1994, to the Pacific and its Island Nations, Australia and subsequently to South East Asia, I conceived the idea of making an updated more ‘now’ version of some of the Exotica music that originated in 1950’s America. Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny were the two I mostly had in mind at the time, but I didn't want it to sound like them and the two words ‘Ambient’ and ‘Electronic’ had to figure large. I was deeply influenced by the ambience of the places I was visiting (Australian birds are scarily creative) and lo-fi electronics were something I had been working with in my free improvisation gigs since the 80’s. I wasn’t playing live very much in Europe, but in Australia and New Zealand regularly and I was living parallel musical lives, playing folk festivals as well as free improv and experimental music gigs. No-one was issuing recorded work by me, so I started my own DIY cd.r. label, Hipshot, and sold them via the internet. I was free to record whatever I wanted and I did, starting in 1999 with Kiribati.\nKiribati is a Pacific Island Nation and was one of the last places to be settled by humans and will be one of the first to disappear as the waters rise due to Global Warming. Is music political that has no lyrics? I would like to think so. A second edition, Globe Notes, appeared in 2001. The music was heavily influenced by reading James Hamilton Patterson’s books Seven Tenths and Playing With Water. The planet is seven tenths water.\nThe summer of 2004 house sitting in Palombara, 40 minutes outside of Rome, at our friend Jo Campbell’s house, in the company of several dogs and numerous cats, I set to work outside in the shed with a Zoom Sampletrack ST-224, two mini disc recorders and a Tascam four track cassette machine; a pile of Arthur Lyman and Martin Denny cds and my lap steel. My intention was to create a kind of music that I had hoped to hear when we visited Hawaii in the early 90’s (some kind of Hawaiian Futurism maybe?) which we never did. Rayon Hula appeared from the shed and was initially released as Hipshot c.d.r. HIP-007. I submitted it to the Ars Electronica awards in Austria and was very surprised when it received some kind of a prize. I think that David Toop had something to do with that, as he was on the jury (thanks David). It was picked up by Cabin Records, a new label initiated by Pete Fowler and Graham Erickson and released as a double 10inch vinyl set. Pete Fowler is an artist/designer and inventor of Monsterism toys as well as illustrator for Super Furry Animals recorded works. He and Graham designed and hand silk screened the covers for this limited edition.\nAlthough the idea was an homage to Arthur Lyman, it was also an homage to Steve Feld who introduced me to the concept of ‘lift up over sounding’ in his book Sound and Sentiment, a study of the Kaluli people of Papua and their relationship with their aural environment. From it I gleaned, among other things, the idea of looped sounds played simultaneously but out of sync. An idea which had in fact guided me from the beginning of the series. The Zoom Sampletrack allowed me to make loops that didn't automatically quantise when played simultaneously, plus it had the capability of pitch shift, reverse and a number of other effects built in. Some of the pieces, once the samples were loaded, were recorded directly from the unit in one take.\nLawrence English at Room40 encouraged me to continue the series and combining another of my artistic roads, live soundtracks for silent films, we released White Shadows In The South Seas in 2013 followed by Fratello Mare in 2015 and Raft in 2017.\n15 years have passed and the tide has risen and retracted in the islands, sometimes extremely violently in places, but we offer a re-mastered, re-edited 2019 version of Rayon Hula.",

            "about": "The 'icon of post-everything', Mike Cooper, returns to Discrepant with a recording of a live set recorded at the Controindicazioni Festival of Improvised Music in Rome in 2003 .\nThe music moves very slowly through four movements: ‘’Reluctant Swimmer’’, ‘’Movies is Magic’’, Virtual Swimmer’’ and ‘’Dolphins’’. 'Floating in out of the exotic ether and disappearing like smoke, engulfed in the alien hugeness of nature... a very elegant set by a visionary artist.'\nMike Cooper says 'the first half is played on my old 1920s National tri-plate lapsteel guitar and the second half on my vietnamese electric lap steel. I also sing two songs along the way. ‘’Movies is Magic’’ by Van Dyke Parks and “Dolphins” by Freid Neil. It was the first time I had ever sung the last song.'\nWith beautiful artwork collage by Evan Crankshaw.",

            "about": "These pieces were recorded in 2005 in London however the lyrics were made earlier during Margaret Thatchers reign of terror as prime minister in the UK. They were released on Spirit Songs on my cdr label Hipshot.\nI am re-releasing them as two tracks isolated from the rest of the Spirit Songs pieces because in all the time that has passed nothing has changed in the UK despite several changes of government from right to left and back and forth and so on. In the past few weeks Law And Order in the UK has prompted me to offer these two pieces again as protest.",

            "about": "From Mike Cooper\nI made the first set of pieces for this collection during the intense heat of the 2023 Spanish summer; 32 degrees inside the house at night\nsometimes. I had just finished reading one of the most extraordinary\nvolumes of fiction ( something I rarely read ) titled The Guyana Quartet by the Caribbean writer Wilson Harris. I came to this book via the works of Nathaniel Mackay, who recommended Wilson Harris as an important\ninfluence on his own creative writing.\nWhile researching further for myTropical Gothic project i came across another writer from Guyana, Edgar Mittelholzer, and his book My Bones And My Flute. The two books couldn’t be more different. Mittelholzer’s book is described as ‘a ghost story in the old fashioned manner’. While The Guyana Quartet is one of the strangest books I have ever read. A lot of the time I had no idea what was going on but its strangeness kept drawing me into it and onwards. It is extremely psychedelic and tropical gothic with an added healthy dose of quantum time. Sometimes the characters are both alive and dead at the same time.\nThe stories all takes place either in the Amazon basin rainforests of\nGuyana or the Rupununi Savannah, home to a vast array of exotic wildlife which includes jaguars, sloths, monkeys, giant otters, tapirs, emerald tree boa snakes and more. I wanted this musical edition to be an aural reflection of the landscapes conjured in my minds eye as I was reading.\nMost of my samples and loops are created using a ukulele, my fingers, a metal hip-flask, (for rum), an empty St James Rum bottle, field recordings from Martinique, electric and acoustic lap steel guitar and a virtual pedal steel guitar. The flute player is unknown but maybe from Vietnam.\nThe titles of my pieces are mostly taken from the two books as well as\nthe title, Slow Motion Lightning, which resonated with me as a\ndescription of our current situation with regards climate change, and\nother man made disasters that have occurred since beginning the pieces.\nSlow Motion Lightning; deadly and unpredictable never strikes\ntwice in the same place except when it does.",

            "about": "Recorded at The Steelworks-Rome and at Viv Corringham's flat in The Angel,London, November 2005. I arrived in London with some pre-recorded backing tracks and overdubbed the vocals and some guitar onto a mini disc. It appeared as Hipshot cdr 016 in 2005. Remixed for this version. This was the first time in many years that I recorded some of my own songs and it was the beginning of a series exploring sung lyrics across improvised electro acoustic backing, something I then pursued as a live concert presentation.The texts were expanded over the years using cut-ups of Thomas Pynchon's two novels, Gravity's Rainbow and V. There are many live recorded versions of Spirit Songs, everyone of them musically different. This was the first and I continue to present them.\n\"\n\"Spirit Songs.. a glorious marriage of all three of Cooper's previous musical strategies; creating a stunning hybrid. The album contains 10 songs performed on fingerpicked acoustic and electric lap steel guitar, often looped and treated in real time, with Cooper singing lyrics in a quietly meandering, semi-improvisatory manner that recalls a more polished Jandek. The style of songwriting is immediately recognizable as blues, but an intuitive, idiosyncratic form of folk-blues, with Cooper narrating laments over matters personal and global, gentle universalisms that double as political messages. All of this occurs over a loose rhythmic framework provided by various noisy loops, with cracks, scratches and pops, echoes and distortions skipping out from every refrain. It's a gentle cacophony with subtle undercurrents of beauty and sadness, effortlessly nostalgic but still very rooted in the now. I think that Mike Cooper can genuinely call this style his own; I've never heard anything remotely like it, and it works beautifully, highlighting both song and singer, as well as the happy accidents resulting from the intersection of structure and chaos.\"- Pitchfork Review.",

            "about": "THE PURPLE PALMS OF BLUESEALAND - Ritual Music\nAround the turn of the 20th century, inspired by Anaphoria, I decided i wanted my own island and I invented Bluesealand. At the time I didnt know that there is an actual island called Sealand. A private island that lies just of the coast of Britain. It is an actual country with a passport etc. Anaphoria is an imaginary island invented by musician Kraig Grady. It exists only on line but also has a passport, flag, history, embassy and music of its own.\nSealand is here -  sealandgov.org/en-eu\nAnaphoria is here -  www.anaphoria.com\nBlueSealand doesnt, as yet, boast a flag, passport etc but i did make postage stamps for the Bluesealand Correos at one point. They made their first appearance in my White Shadows In The South Seas installation in Rome and in the booklet insert for my Globe Notes vinyl release on No=Fi records in 2013.\nHere I have begun to make a catalogue of some of the most recent ritual music that can be heard on BlueSealand. The local culture and music, askewing traditional instruments, is futuristic, technologically advanced and digital, and with an acknowledgement and consideration for nature.\nLegend has it that one day in 1967 a container ship on its way from Taiwan across the Pacific Ocean crewed by Sulawesi merchant seamen, encountered a violent storm and a rogue wave hit the ship destroying its navigation, radar and wireless systems. Several containers were washed overboard which drifted for several months before turning up on the beaches of BlueSealand. One of the containers had computers inside and another several boxes of freshly pressed vinyl L.P.s. A recently returned from overseas member of the population was computer savvy and quickly taught everyone how to utilise this bounty particularly for making music. Amongst the vinyl boxes was one that soon became a huge favourite among locals called Silver Apples Of The Moon by Morton Subotnik. The influence of this record can be detected in their ritual music.\nTrack 12 - The Wild Birds Of Bluesealand was made for the compilation album Synthetic Bird Music compiled by Jakub Juhás (mappa) and is available also on Bandcamp.",

            "about": "Since 2016 we’ve been blessed with Mike Cooper in our catalog. The first installment was “New Kiribati”, revisiting a self-released 1999 CDR in which Mike Cooper was experimenting with a lap steel, electronics, prepared guitar and live recordings, creating what he called “Ambient Exotica Soundscapes”. In the following year, “Reluctant Swimmer” showed an enigmatic, exotic and elegant adventure into Mike’s 1920s National tri-plate lap steel guitar and his Vietnamese electric lap steel. Two pieces, two sides, each ending with beautiful interpretations of some Mike’s favourite songs, “Movies Is Magic” by Van Dyke Parks and Fred Neil’s “Dolphins”.\n2018 and it’s time for some new discoveries into Mike Cooper’s limitless exploration in his collection of guitars. The title itself, “Tropical Gothic” references Cooper’s beloved areas of ‘the South’ with a Gothic, dark, remote interplay... ‘’Tropical Gothic includes, but is by no means limited to, a reflection on a region where European colonial powers fought intensively against indigenous populations and against each other for control of land and resources.’’\nIn each side Mike Cooper studies different approaches to his method of uniting guitar and field recordings into a constant stream of sound, where he delivers chaos and melody – not necessarily in that order. Side A is composed of shorter pieces. Each of them offers a myriad of images and sensations, between the enigmatic and terror (“The Pit”), joy, happiness and freedom (“Running Naked”) or pure contemplation (“Onibaba”).\n“Onibaba” runs as a fitting introduction to Side B and its 18th minute magical piece “Lelong & Gods Of Bali”. A mix of ambient exotica music, silent film soundtrack and distorted rhythms that dance around Mike’s guitar. It keeps reinventing and transforming itself throughout those eighteen minutes, summing up the dexterity and muscle of Mike Cooper’s music of the last two decades.",

This piece is a composite of elements of the two soundtracks I perform live. Onibaba is a Japanese film from the 60s and these pieces were originally released on my Hipshot cdr label and Tropical Gothic was released on Discrepant as a 12 inch vinyl l.p.

            "about": "THIS TITLE IS OUT OF PRINT.\n*\nAlbum page:  paradiseofbachelors.com/shop/pob-013/\nArtist page:  paradiseofbachelors.com/mike-cooper/\nOther options:  smarturl.it/PoB13\nNARRATIVE\nParadise of Bachelors is proud to present the first artist-sanctioned reissues—and first-ever vinyl reissues—of iconoclastic English-born, Rome-based folk and experimental music legend Mike Cooper’s classic trio of early 1970s avant-folk-rock records: Trout Steel (1970), Places I Know (1971), and The Machine Gun Co. with Mike Cooper (1972). The latter two titles are presented for the very first time as the definitive double album, as Cooper originally intended them to be released.\nWith the oddly evocative choice of his third solo album’s title, appropriated from Richard Brautigan’s 1967 surrealist-pastoral novel Trout Fishing in America, Mike Cooper might very well have been describing his own mercurial musical practice. “Trout Steel” suggests a reflective, highly mutable, quicksilver riverine element, an apt metaphor for the lap steel runs summoned from his trademark National resophonic guitars and his restless, constantly evolving development as a singer, composer, interpreter, and improviser. Listening to Cooper’s recordings retrospectively in sequence reveals a rangy narrative of perennial reinvention from document to document through a playful approach to the deconstruction of “folk” musics and all that gross genre signifier implies and denies. Because of his staunch refusal to settle on any single sonic palette, his career has maintained a slippery, elusive, and multihued character—troutlike, eddying—full of permutations, sudden departures and transformations, and unexpected articulations and detours.\nBy the time the Rolling Stones invited him to join the band in the early ’60s, and he politely declined (true story; Brian Jones took the gig), he had already progressed far beyond the circumscribed bounds of their early, hip-histrionic Albionic blues. By the time he was rumored to have retired from music in the mid ’70s, disappearing from his home in Southern England into Southern Spain to become a fisherman (an amusing fiction; he suffers from seasickness), he had already moved beyond his heady homebrew of progressive, free jazz-framed songcraft into increasingly less conventionally structured frontiers of open improvisation and later, electronic composition.\nThe molting began in 1970 with Trout Steel, on which Cooper took a decisive step away from the folk and blues scenes in which he was well-known—he had toured with Michael Chapman and traveled in the same circles as Bert Jansch, Wizz Jones, and Davey Graham, among others—toward the New Thing jazz of Pharaoh Sanders, Sonny Sharrock, and Derek Bailey, without sacrificing any of his lyrical songwriting or forsaking his established roots in the soil of the American Southern vernacular. Producer Peter Eden (Donovan, Bill Fay, Clive Palmer) assembled a crack team of English and South African jazz and folk musicians (including Mike Osborne, Harry Miller, Geoff Hawkins, Stefan Grossman, and Heron) to record these remarkable sessions, and the results are absolutely sui generis, a compelling mix of tradition, group improvisations, and unfettered studio explorations that presaged Cooper’s adventurous work for decades to come.\n+ First-ever artist-sanctioned and vinyl reissue\n+ Includes 16 pp. chapbook with an exhaustive essay, lyrics, and never published color photos\n+ Available on 150g virgin vinyl as a gatefold LP, in a deluxe limited edition, as well as on gatefold CD and digital formats\n+ Vinyl edition includes digital download coupon",

            "about": "This album was recorded live at Fanfulla in Rome and is essentially a blues album and was to me the logical place that blues bands should have been in the 21st Century. It combined my love of Country Blues and Free Jazz. A logical combination in my mind.\nThis group would not have happened without the talents of drummer Fabrizio Spera and Bass player Roberto Bellatalla who both contributed so much here. We never ever rehearsed or even discussed anything before getting on stage and just playing. Whatever came along I sang over.\nThe lyrical poetry and music of Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Blind Boy Fuller, Howlin’ Wolf, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Muddy Waters and others is de-constructed, explored and offered up as free / electro-acoustic / new jazz / future blues.\nWe imagined meetings between Charley Patton, Albert Ayler, Stockhausen and Scelsi or Blind Boy Fuller and Sonny Sharrock, Sun Ra and Penderecki. Deep blues, slide guitar, free improvised passages of ecstatic grooves; cross rhythms, clashing, overlapping, out of sync electronic loops and drones, de-constructed, re-configured future blues.

                    "about": "TRUTH IN THE ABSTRACT BLUES as simply a ‘blues band’; Instead, think a collective of musicians improvising around themes of mostly country blues songs and re-locating them from their 12 bar musical structures into a new free-jazz and electronic environment where all three members are at liberty to explore their potential away from the restrictions of style and cliche that seem to have attached themselves to the form.\nThe lyrical poetry and music of Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton, Blind Boy Fuller, Howlin’ Wolf, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Muddy Waters and others is de-constructed, explored and offered up as free / electro-acoustic / new jazz / future blues.\nThis band is Mike Cooper’s brainchild, and the singularity of his vision, playing and personality infuse their sound. He uses electronics, samples, pedals and traditional playing techniques in a combination that is so unique and yet so accessible that it makes the (supposed) modern problem of unifying all the disparate elements of oneself moot. When this set was over, I felt like I had just found an abandoned jug of whiskey from the 1920s, wriggled its fat dusty cork out, took a giant whiff of all that time with all its heady scents and then tilted the bottle back for a slow, deep slug.",

            "about": "A note from Mike....\nI was born during World War Two and I hope I don’t die during the next World War.\n“A screaming comes across the sky. It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now”\nThese are the opening words of Thomas Pynchon’s novel Gravity’s Rainbow, a book that I have lived with for a half a century since it was ﬁrst published in 1973.\nIts main character is the V2 rocket that Germany sent across the sky to England during that World War.\nThe V2 predecessor was the V1: actually the ﬁrst jet propelled ﬂying bomb invented by the Germans. In 1944 they launched 10,000 of them against Britain killing around 6,000 people and injuring many many more during that war.\nThat same year came the V2, the world’s ﬁrst long range guided ballistic missile and the ﬁrst man made object to reach Space travelling at supersonic speed and consequently arriving at its target with no audible warning. 3000 of these were launched against Britain, killing a further 9000 people. The toll is even higher if you include the 12,000 forced labourers and concentration camp prisoners who died whilst manufacturing them too.\nModern space travel, guided rocket munitions and long range missiles have their origins in these German weapons from 80 years ago; all evolving from these original V1 and V2 rockets.\nI made these pieces in the ﬁrst two weeks of June 2025 as Israel continued (and continues) to commit war crimes in Gaza and the rest of Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and then, with the full support of most of the western worlds governments, with its attacks on Iran.\nDedicated to Thomas Pynchon and all friends and colleagues displaced or missing since 1948 in this on-going tragedy that should never have happened in the ﬁrst place.",

It has happened before, but there is nothing to compare it to now”\nAssembled in Valencia/Spain June 2025",

            "about": "t’s difficult to know how to summurise the meandering journey that has been the life and times of Mike Cooper. Having just celebrated his 70th year of mischief making here’s what we can tell you...\n-:- A young Mike Cooper can be spotted playing a beatnik guitarist on an anti-nuclear march in London beat cult film “That Kind Of Girl”.\n-:- His first band The Blues Committee played with and supported blues legends such John Lee Hooker, Howlin Wolf and Jimmy Reed.\n-:- Cooper was central in launching several of the first folk and blues venues outside London, especially in and around Reading.\n-:- He was a regular on John Peel’s program from 1969-1975, recording numerous sessions.\n-:- His free music group The Recedents was formed in 1982, threading directly into London vibrant improvisation community.\n-:- He moved to Italy in 1988 after a slew of musical projects during the 80s in the UK and EU.\n-:- Since 1994 he has spent increasing amounts of time touring and exploring Oceania.\n-:- One of the outcomes of his exploration is Beach Crossings-Pacific Footprints - a radiophone work commissioned by Italian and Australian radio - that traces the history of colonisation in the Pacific by Europeans from Tahiti up to the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima.\n-:- His recordings have been re-issued numerous times by labels across the globe. Original pressings are found for obscene prices via various outlets.\nWhite Shadows In The South Seas is his latest offering and follows up directly from his lauded Rayon Hula album. It’s a pacific sunset-like dream spanning the horizon in pulsing waves of richly coloured rhythms, tropical sound fields and pacific-inspired slide guitar.\n’Running his Hawaiian loops sweet and slow, Mike Cooper’s homage to Arthur Lyman is a masterpiece of contemporary exotica.’ The Wire.\n‘Recent attempts at resurrecting exotica by John Zorn and Tipsy have been a little too reverent for their own good...RAYON HULA is the first truly sincere attempt at 21st Century exotica..a cool breeze of an album, experimental but eminently listenable.’ Brainwashed.",
