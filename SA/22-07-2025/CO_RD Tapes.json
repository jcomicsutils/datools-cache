Where β01-03 were drafted with hot summer months in mind, β04 represents the first of the three Autumnal months. Recorded in the thick of leafy Autumn in the White Pillar Workshop using a no-input analog mixer and a single analog delay unit.\n**Note: The digital version of Pyanepsion contains the original unedited session recordings, which are much longer than the 18m edits on the cassette sides.",

            "about": "MAIMAKTERION is the fifth release in the Bacchus Tapes subcatalog at CO_RD. The previous four volumes were all initially issued on very limited cassettes, but Bacchus 5 is the first that breaks this tradition and arrives on the CD-R/digital format instead. This change allows the Bacchus Tapes recordings to maintain their runtime length more freely and offers less restrictive possibilities for subsequent volumes.\nSonically, Bacchus 5 continues where Bacchus 4 began, with two half-hour feedback drones created using a no-input mixer and minimal outboard effects. Dense and heavy while also levitating above the ground, Maimakterion's deep tones recall influences from Eliane Radigue, David Burraston, Sunn O))), Eleh and Richard Chartier. At once, psychedelic and electrical, bright and endless - Bacchus 5 continues the series' mark of higher-volume listening experiences that are equal parts vibration and texture.\nSupplementally, Bacchus 4 is also being given a CD-R reissue alongside Bacchus 5, making this the first time the entire Bacchus Tapes catalog has been made available on CD-R.",

            "about": "BACCHUS TAPES 6 reaches land with POSEIDEON, the longest and possibly the deepest entry in the catalog to date, with six extended sessions (as opposed to the usual two) that add up to a total running time of 2 hours, 12 minutes and 11 seconds.\nConstructed using only the sound generated from an SSM-1750 Optimus mixing board (manufactured by Radio Shack) feeding back on itself through two input channels with no external input source. A Nady MM14-FX unit was utilized in the signal chain to both boost volume and modulate the feedback slightly with an analog delay. The mixer's internal slapback-style delay was also used on a couple of the recordings for the same purpose. The sonic assault was tamed and shaped into tonal drones that were left to self-oscillate for between 10-30 minutes each, and this material was then overdubbed on multitrack tape using a Vesta Fire MR-10B tape machine, where each recorded input of the drone-feedback signal was assigned a different pitch than the last, forming a five-voice chord when the tape dubs were overlaid with the SSM's live voice. From there, all four of the taped/pitched drones were panned in pairs of two for the duration of the session, creating a dense, swirling environment that is just as physical as it is audible.\nDesigned to be played back at either very low or very high decibel levels, POSEIDEON offers literal churning oceans of electricity and mirror-on-mirror signal amplification. Inspired by drone pioneers like Eliane Radigue, David Burraston and Eleh, as well as feedback masters Aube, Acre and Sunn O))), POSEIDEON represents a pinnacle moment for the BACCHUS series, and a fascinating application of older out-of-phase recording equipment, illustrating proof-positive sound designs that could have been made over 20 years ago.",

            "about": "A double-disc collection of all six tracks from the first three releases in the Bacchus Tapes series. Issued for the first time on a non-analog physical format. Bacchus tapes went dark after the third cassette in 2011, and is now finally being reinstated as an active series. To commemorate this, and bring these long out of print recordings back into physical existence, this double-album compilation has been assembled. Subsequent editions in the series will continue to be produced on VERY short run cassettes, with eventual (but not immediate) digital reissues such as this.\nThe three tapes presented here were conceived and recorded to represent the three months of summer, full and thick with ungrounded electrical humming, amp spring verb splashes and heavy passages of chordal layering with organ, guitar & mixer feedback, electric bass and synthesizers. This is wild and bright music, intended for louder listening experiences.",
            "credits": "released January 13, 2017\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Botany Bay, 2011. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is CO_RD Tapes number β-C1.",

            "about": "This is a raw, unedited and unaltered recording of a 13 year old cassette tape side. In 2000, I was in a band with three other friends, and we used to regularly rehearse in my father's house, which was in the actual middle of nowhere. He lived over a mile away from a single neighbor, in the deep country, right next to acres of overgrown swamps, on a plot of land that has remained in my family since sometime around the Civil War.\nLiving there with him was hard sometimes, especially at night - you'd walk outside and swear someone was watching. Additionally, every time my friends or my sister's friends would visit, they would inevitably experience some kind of sound oddity (disembodied voices from outside or elsewhere in the house, strange noises from within the swamp like a heartbeat) that left them never wanting to come back again. Occasionally, this activity would also include failing lights, spots of unusual cold or even glimpses of figures in your peripheral vision - although the latter could always be attributed to the mind making things up in a stressful situation.\nOn the night this tape was recorded, my band had just finished rehearsing and we were in prime prankster mode. Our drummer wanted to sleep on the couch, as he had to clock into work early the next day, and we were determined to mess with him. Me being the perpetual documentarian that I am, I decided it would be *extra* fun if we recorded it, so I set up a mic discreetly next to the sofa where he wouldn't see, and rolled tape. After a few minutes, we relented and went into my room on the other side of the house to let him sleep. A few minutes later, he bursts into my room scared out of his mind, telling us he felt cold for no reason, and that there were things tapping at the windows and he heard things moving the shades, even though the windows were shut and there was no one else in the house. We immediately assumed he was trying to get even with us, and then I realized we had taped the entire thing. We got the tape, brought it back and decided if anything actually happened, it would have been recorded. Sure enough, after you hear us leave the room, things start to bump the microphone and even stranger rhythmic pulses start to take the audio over. We were shocked.\nEven today, I have no explanation for what this really is. People might think I threw this together in a program, but rest assured every single person who was with me that night can verify that this tape is real. One of them even refused to ever come back to my father's place after this happened. It remains one of the weirdest experiences I've had in my lifetime of recording, and I thought the tape rip, along with the story of how it came to be, would make interesting night time discussion. As Ed Wood wrote in Plan 9 From Outer Space: \"Can you prove that it didn't happen?\"",

            "about": "Desiccant Chamber is a binaural room recording of a Phoenix R250 LGR slowly removing moisture from inside the walls and ceiling, across fifty-nine minutes. Constant gusting hot air, a humming drone in the lower midrange register and a hazy bath of white noise coalesce in red light on dry surfaces. A high-resolution document of unique appliance-driven physical synthesis, presented here with only minimal parametric equalization, for listeners fascinated with fridge hums, AC units and white noise of the mundane and exotic varieties.",

            "about": "Naked Sound Eleven is a recent assemblage of several hours of recorded sound from beneath three different window AC units in my current home. A monolithic drone radiates from these machines that is both soothing and powerful, and Martius (as I have so named it) is a testament to the brutal South Carolinian heat and humidity that comes with life in a sub-tropical zone. For those who don't know, we don't really get a Spring season like most others do - we tend to go straight from Winter cold to Summer heat levels as early as February. To compound on top of that, my current home is on top of a spring, meaning everything always contains some level of moisture, and never truly dries up. I have grown to hate this kind of weather, the older I get, and so with my sticky arms and sweating fists pointed at the sky, I submit Martius as a report of protest against this yearly green Hell we must endure.\n\"For hate's sake, I spit my last breath at thee.\"\n-H. Melville, 1851",

            "about": "Over Land is a process-generated sound event that has been triggered by field recordings of a 60+ minute open-air slow drive through a desert park, at sunset. Once set into motion, a Lucier-esque domino effect of droning reverb overtones emerges from 24 mixer channels, each subsequently routed into the next. At the 11th channel, the audio is pitched an octave lower on each subsequent copy until the 16th channel, when the audio is pitched an octave higher on each subsequent copy. Further, the first channel is treated with two slowly sweeping low pass filters, one mostly resonant and one not, each oscillating at a different rate. This sends \"waves\" through the rest of the mixer channels, and ensures that no two moments of this generative piece are alike. In effect, the sounds you hear are a combination of overtones from human speech, outdoor atmospheres, vehicle noise and the shape of the reverb units themselves. A similar configuration was used on the Womb Oscillations recordings, where the source sound was prenatal ultrasounds, and the album Tuesday, April 10th 2012, where the source was 150+ pieces of pop music.",

            "about": "Upon cleaning out my old studio space at 114RKD, I located several old hard drives, dozens of tapes and CD-R/DVD-Rs filled with unnamed amounts of material that was shoved into stasis for one reason or another. This album is one such artifact, retrieved from a CD-R bearing the title \"Naked Sound Eight\", which it very likely may have become if this series had gone on at Second Sun Recordings. Contained on this disc are three sides of cassette tape - the first being a recording of AM radio noise from in between bands, modulating and phasing in and out of reception physically as we drove from Foxhill to 114RKD. Strange tonalities and warbled noise coalesce into the tape, informing a document of local radio scenery in rural South Carolina. The second piece is a recording of someone mumbling and installing some kind of appliance, while the tape deck's batteries decline and smear the incoming audio in different ways. In this recording it's also worth noting that the cassette used for the recording was heavily treated with prolonged exposure to heat and light, and it was easily a couple dozen generations of overdubs down the line before this audio was laid onto it. The third piece is as the title implies - a recording of my wife and I driving home one night. The recorder's batteries were almost completely used up at this point, and I remember positioning the recorder in a small cavity beneath the car's dashboard, as close to the engine as possible. The result is a strange ambience that mixes auto engine sound, terrain textures and unintelligible human speech.\nNaked Sound continues to remain an outlet for strange audio and non-musical territories, and NS14 is certainly a pillar within that ethos, excavated from years past and framed nicely on a round white disc.\nAdditionally, an ambient mix of \"Experiments In Static\" has been constructed via the Botany Bay studio rig, and released here as V.R.H. :  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/v-r-h",

            "about": "A three-plus hour binaural recording of late-night Carolinian rainfall in the Botany Bay backyard. Some sections of this recording appeared in altered/processed form as a backdrop for the soon to be released Coppice Halifax album Rurals, while Water On Glass is the complete and unedited recording. In the last three months, I've used this recording as a superb sleep aid, as it provides the perfect amount of pitter-patter from the amplified sound of the raindrops on glass, as opposed to an outdoor recording. It eloquently captures the warm happiness I feel on rainy or inclement nights, when just knowing you're inside and comfortably protected from the elements is enough to reassure you in some profound way.\nEditor's Note: The full recording had to be divided up into three separate parts in accordance with Bandcamp's file upload restrictions. As such, these three files are designed to run seamlessly on playback, provided the listener uses playback devices that do not add gaps between tracks.\nThere is also a limited CD-R version with a composite 80-minute mix of Water On Glass, carefully assembled to fit on a single disc.",

            "about": "Wind Memorial is a field recording taken from the vantage point of my bedroom window, sitting above the now-defunct fan unit for my home's air conditioning. I've isolated the sound of the fan itself and created a composite collage where it overlaps with itself at four different pitches, and this processing, when accounting for the outdoor sounds also present for the recording, yields a fascinating late-Summer excursion into appliance-voiced drone music. Having recorded and assembled this piece last year, during the same Summer months, I didn't quite feel it was ready for release until now, when the unit itself finally quit functioning. Now, with the absence of airflow through my home, this Wind Memorial feels apt. So enjoy the tonalities hidden inside a 12-year old motorized fan, and meditate to reduce the Summer heat by will alone.",

            "about": "Brian's \"Naked Sound Seven\" is the seventh volume of his ongoing Naked Sound series of found sound, field recordings and musique-concrete experiments. Four 10-minute pieces creating using only numerical frequencies of sine tones to create mathematically-harmonic chord drones. Very warm and bassy, but incredibly monochromatic, and probably better suited to a \"room listening\" presentation where the sound is allowed to merely color the physical environment rather than surround it. This is incredibly minimal, dissonance-free ambience that would be best enjoyed in the evening as the listener relaxes with other activities such as reading a book or taking a warm bath.",
            "credits": "released May 3, 2009\nConstructed, produced, recorded and mastered by Brian Grainger at 114RKD, 2009. This is Second Sun Recordings number SSRO-13, and seventh in the Naked Sound catalog set. Photograph taken by Brian, Dayton, Ohio, 2007.",

            "about": "Built using generative post-processing on field recordings of me mowing my overgrown backyard in the Summer heat of 2016, Naked Sound Seventeen is an idyllic portrait of the Carolinian green season and a singular farewell to the house I brought my daughter home to. 2016 saw me spending my last brutal 9-month Summer in South Carolina, something I can happily state that I sincerely do not miss, now living here in Ohio. My home in the south was literally on the back of a spring, meaning that my yard was perpetually growing out of control, and that nothing ever dried out. Yard maintenance was more of a chore than it usually is for anyone else, as I'd have to sometimes divide the work into two days because of the intense heat and humidity. Yet, when the work was done, you'd have about a week of a beautiful, shaggy Bradburian green lawn to admire. So, much like Naked Sound Eleven was a testament to the unbearable heat of those Carolinian Summers, Seventeen is such a document of the overflowing greenery surrounding my home during that time, which in no small way helped to considerably define my Botany Bay studio and the approach to creative thinking that followed within it.\nAdditionally, much like V.R.H. mined new sonic real estate out of Naked Sound Fourteen, NS#17 has yielded an album of Coppice Halifax excavations, which compost the material presented here into humid ambient techno shapes:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/subtropix",

A very awkward and engaging listen, and remarkably similar in sound to our good friend Ophibre, who has influenced Brian's experimental tendencies greatly.",
            "credits": "released November 30, 2007\nConstructed, recorded, produced and mastered by Brian Grainger. Recorded at 114RKD, Summer 2007. This is CO_RD Tapes number NS#6, and sixth in the Naked Sound catalog set. Photograph taken by Brian, Foxhill, 2007.",

These recordings were then comb filtered and modulated into larger sonic masses that hang like analog fog above the slippery street. Warm and blanketing sound, appropriate for the Winter weather.\nNOTE: The digital version presented here is over 100 minutes long, therefore the limited edition CD-R version contains special composite mixes, adjusted to fit the disc's runtime limit.",
            "credits": "released December 21, 2016\nInitial recording / subsequent processing and engineering by Brian Grainger. Captured in Columbia, Summer 2016, while driving from Rolling Knoll to Botany Bay. Cover photo taken at Rolling Knoll the same night as the subsequent recording. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is CO_RD Tapes number NS16, and sixteenth in the Naked Sound series.",

            "about": "A one to two-hour field recording of my home was made every day during the month of May in 2007, with the intention of exponentially pitch shifting the audio so much that each day's recording would be presented as a 1-3 minute piece, therefore allowing an entire month of field recordings to be experienced in the runtime of a single album. Naked Sound Ten plays with the idea of time as a processing element, showcasing different sonic ephemera that only becomes obvious after the length of a file has been compressed beyond any recognizable point. These thirty-one recordings were also recently utilized in more elongated processing steps to create the Coppice Halifax album M31, wherein all thirty-one field recordings are layered together in a single 2 hour piece. Naked Sound Ten is the sound of an environment heard at a macroscopic level, and a possible example of how the world might sound if humans were to experience it at 10% of their normal pace.",

            "about": "A three-hour recording of platelets being extracted from my blood, rendered down to a set of three composite pieces, then processed through an elaborate chain of frequency-triggered FFT filters to produce the hidden tonalities in the room, the human voices and the sounds of the medical machines. Alien and contemplative, Naked Sound Thirteen keeps the series as strange as ever.\nThe digital version of this release contains all three unabridged pieces, totaling 2:03:41 in runtime. The limited edition CD-R contains three carefully assembled truncated versions, specially mixed for the physical format, in order to fit onto a single disc.",
            "credits": "released March 1, 2016\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Extracted at the American Red Cross, Summer 2015. Processed and regenerated at Botany Bay, Winter 2015. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is CO_RD Tapes number NS#13, and 13th in the ongoing Naked Sound series.",

            "about": "For Brian's third foray into the Naked Sound series concept, a release that is completely obsessed with threes emerges. Fifteen tracks, each 3 minutes and 33 seconds in length, comprised solely of the processed sound of empty cassette tape hiss. Minimalism as a joke and as an experiment, all at once. Emptiness as music, so-called silence mutated into sound. A varied and colorful collection of audio that is somewhere between music and...nothing.",
            "credits": "released February 15, 2007\nRecorded and produced by Brian Grainger. Photography by Brian. This is CO_RD Tapes number NS#3, and third in the Naked Sound catalog series.",

            "about": "A two-hour recording of a sleet storm from behind the Botany Bay studio window, treated and processed to bring out the sound of the sleet and cancel out other elements of the recording, such as the room sound itself. A minimal hiss of white noise and the texture of the sleet tapping at the glass occasionally makes Naked Sound Twelve a perfect candidate for bedtime listening, reminding you of the comforts of your bed, blanket and pillow while your room protects you like a shield from the elements.\nThe CD-R version of Naked Sound Twelve contains a special \"composite\" mix of Sleet Farming, optimized to fit onto an 80-minute disc.",
            "credits": "released June 19, 2015\nRecorded and processed by Brian Grainger at Botany Bay, February 2015. This is CO_RD Tapes number NS#12, and twelfth in the ongoing Naked Sound catalog. Cover photo taken by Brian at Birch Park, 4 AM, 2008.",
