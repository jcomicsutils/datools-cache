            "about": "The extraordinary creative partnership of New Haven, Connecticut duo Kath Bloom and Loren Connors has haunted fans of fragile folk and blues since the early 80s.\nKath taught herself guitar during shifts as a janitor at a New Haven cemetery, while Loren’s free-form idiosyncratic style had been developing since the late 60s. Between 1981 and 1984, the duo recorded two live and four studio albums, mostly self-released in tiny quantities.\nEarly on, their music mixed folk and blues traditionals with a handful of Kath’s vulnerable, moving originals. By the later albums the songs were all Kath’s - her fragile voice and subdued finger- picking set against Loren’s abstract but always supportive playing. Together the duo created a sound almost impossibly emotional and haunting.\nMoonlight emerged as the duo’s final album in 1984, in an edition of 200-300 copies. As her creativity accelerated, Kath’s songs became looser and more intuitive, but Moonlight contains an early version of one of Kath’s most beloved songs, Come Here. Loren’s longterm collaborator Robert Crotty contributes electric guitar to a couple of tracks.\nBy 1984, Kath was married with a young son, and Connors was entering a new relationship, so the duo found themselves drifting apart. Kath did not release anything again until a 1993 solo cassette Love Explosion, but then developed a devoted cult following through the pivotal use of a new recording of Come Here in Richard Linklater’s 1995 film Before Sunrise.\nKath has since released three solo albums on Chapter Music (Finally in 2005, Terror in 2008 and Pass Through Here in 2015), as well as the Bloom tribute album Loving Takes This Course, featuring covers by the likes of Bill Callahan, Mark Kozelek, Devendra Banhart, Josephine Foster and many more.\nLoren also retreated from music for a period until re-emerging in the late 1980s. He is now recognised as a pioneering guitar explorer, and has worked with the likes of Thurston Moore, Keiji Haino, Jim O’Rourke and many more.\nAfter reissuing four of Kath & Loren’s landmark albums on CD in the late 2000s, Chapter has now embarked on the first ever vinyl reissues for these remarkable records. Another 1984 album Restless Faithful Desperate was reissued in 2018, while 1983’s Sand In My Shoe will be released alongside Moonlight in October 2019.\nMoonlight includes five digital-only bonus tracks of rare 1984 live recordings, as well as comprehensive digital liner notes.",

            "about": "The extraordinary creative partnership of New Haven, CT duo Kath Bloom and Loren Connors has haunted psych-folk fans since the early 80s.\nKath taught herself guitar during shifts as a janitor at a New Haven cemetery, while Loren’s free-form idiosyncratic style had been developing since the late 60s. Between 1981 and 1984, the duo recorded two live and four studio albums, mostly self-released in tiny quantities.\nEarly on, their music mixed folk and blues traditionals with a handful of Kath’s vulnerable, moving originals. By the later albums the songs were all Kath’s - her fragile voice and subdued finger-picking set against Loren’s abstract but always supportive playing. Together the duo created a sound almost impossibly emotional and haunting.\nRestless Faithful Desperate emerged in 1984, in an edition of 200-300 copies. As her creativity accelerated, Kath’s songs became looser and more intuitive, but Restless contains one of her most gorgeously realised compositions, Look at Me. Loren’s long-term collaborator Robert Crotty contributed electric guitar on a couple of tracks\nBy 1984, however, Kath was married with a young son, and Connors was entering a new relationship, so after 1984 the duo found themselves drifting apart. Kath did not release anything again until a 1993 solo cassette Love Explosion, but then developed a devoted cult following through the pivotal use of her song Come Here in Richard Linklater’s 1995 film Before Sunrise.\nKath has since released three solo albums on Chapter Music (Finally in 2005, Terror in 2008 and Pass Through Here in 2015), as well as the Bloom tribute album Loving Takes This Course, featuring covers by the likes of Bill Callahan, Mark Kozelek, Devendra Banhart, Josephine Foster and many more.\nLoren also retreated from music for a period until re-emerging in the late 1980s. He is now recognised as a pioneering guitar explorer, and has worked with the likes of Thurston Moore, Keiji Haino, Jim O’Rourke and many more.\nAfter reissuing four of Kath & Loren’s landmark albums on CD in the late 2000s, Chapter now embarks on the first ever vinyl reissues for these remarkable records. Expect more volumes in early 2019.\nThis album includes a digital-only bonus track of 1982 compilation track Tell Him. Each LP will include digital bonus material.",

            "about": "HAVE JUST FOUND SOME ORIGINAL 2009 2CDs SO HAVE PUT THIS ON BANDCAMP FOR THE FIRST TIME!\nFROM THE ORIGINAL 2009 PRESS RELEASE\nRestless Faithful Desperate/Moonlight is the second of Chapter Music’s double disc reissues by extraordinary early 80s folk duo Kath Bloom and Loren Connors.\nMeeting in 1976 in their hometown New Haven, CT, Kath Bloom and Loren Connors formed a creative partnership that has haunted psych-folk fans ever since, releasing six albums of fragile avant- garde folk-blues in miniscule quantities, all of which now change hands for huge sums.\nAt first, Kath would act out monologues while Loren played his free-form guitar, extrapolated from Mississippi Delta and Chicago blues, but gradually he and Kath’s performances became more song-based. Kath began practising guitar among the headstones of New Haven’s Grove Street cemetery, while Loren’s idiosyncratic style had been developing since the 1960s.\nAfter self-releasing two limited edition live albums, the duo recorded Sing The Children Over for tiny Boston label Ambiguous Records in 1982, and then in 1983 self-released fourth album Sand In My Shoe. Early on, their albums mixed traditional folk and blues songs with a handful of Kath’s vulnerable, moving originals. But by the later albums, the songs were all Kath’s - her fragile voice and subdued finger-picked guitar set against Loren’s abstract playing, skittering, sometimes atonal but always intui- tively supportive. Together the duo created a sound almost impossibly emotional and haunting, unlike anything created before or since.\nTheir last two albums Restless Faithful Desperate and Moonlight both emerged in 1984, in editions of 200-300 copies on Loren’s St. Joan label. As her creativity accelerated, so Kath’s songs became looser, more intuitive, with a darkening of tone and an eventual abandonment of intent to shape the music. The songs were still there, however - Restless contains one of her most gorgeous compositions Look at Me, while Moonlight includes an early version of Kath’s signature tune Come Here.\nBy 1984 Kath was married with a young son, and Connors himself was entering a new relationship, so the duo found themselves drifting apart. Kath did not release anything again until a 1993 solo cassette Love Explosion, but then developed a devoted cult following through the pivotal use of Come Here in Richard Linklater’s 1995 film Before Sunrise. She has since released two solo albums on Chapter Music, as well as the recent Bloom tribute album Loving Takes This Course, featuring covers by the likes of Devendra Banhart, Bill Callahan, Mark Kozelek, Josephine Foster and many more.\nLoren also retreated from music for a period until re-emerging in the late 1980s. He is now recognised as a pioneering guitar explorer, and has worked with the likes of Thurston Moore, Keiji Haino, Jim O’Rourke and many more.\nAfter a quarter of a century, Kath Bloom and Loren Connors’ incredible recordings are finally available again. The reissue includes extensive liner notes, original photos and artwork, and six bonus tracks taken from a rare 1982 compilation and an unreleased 1984 live session!\n“Devastating songwriting...the cult singer-songwriter's weary voice gnaws into the listener's hide.” - NPR\n“Unlike anything else of its time in its mix of the conventional and avant-garde” - Allmusic\n“(Kath Bloom) is teetering on a Vashti Bunyan level of rebirth” - Pitchfork",

            "about": "The extraordinary creative partnership of New Haven, CT duo Kath Bloom and Loren Connors has haunted psych-folk fans since the early 80s.\nKath taught herself guitar during shifts as a janitor at a New Haven cemetery, while Loren’s free-form idiosyncratic style had been developing since the late 60s. Between 1981 and 1984, the duo recorded two live and four studio albums, mostly self-released in tiny quantities.\nEarly on, their music mixed folk and blues traditionals with a handful of Kath’s vulnerable, moving originals. By the later albums the songs were all Kath’s - her fragile voice and subdued finger- picking set against Loren’s abstract but always supportive playing. Together the duo created a sound almost impossibly emotional and haunting.\nKath & Loren’s first two albums in 1981-82 were live recordings, released via Loren’s Daggett Records label. Next came 1982’s Sing The Children Over on Massachusetts label Ambiguous Records. Then Sand In My Shoe emerged in 1983 as the first release on Loren’s new St. Joan label, in an edition of 200-300 copies with handmade sleeves.\nRestless Faithful Desperate and Moonlight followed in 1983-84, before the prodigious duo parted ways. Kath did not release any- thing again until a 1993 solo cassette Love Explosion, but then developed a devoted cult following through the pivotal use of her song Come Here in Richard Linklater’s 1995 film Before Sunrise.\nKath has since released three solo albums on Chapter Music (Finally in 2005, Terror in 2008 and Pass Through Here in 2015), as well as the Bloom tribute album Loving Takes This Course, featuring covers by the likes of Bill Callahan, Mark Kozelek, Devendra Banhart, Josephine Foster and many more.\nLoren also retreated from music for a period until re-emerging in the late 1980s. He is now recognised as a pioneering guitar explorer, and has worked with the likes of Thurston Moore, Keiji Haino, Jim O’Rourke and many more.\nAfter reissuing Kath & Loren’s four landmark studio albums on CD in the late 2000s, Chapter has now embarked on the first ever vinyl reissues for these remarkable records. Restless Faithful Desperate was reissued in 2018, while Moonlight will be released alongside Sand In My Shoe in October 2019.\nSand In My Shoe includes five digital-only bonus tracks, from 1982 live EP Pushin’ Up Daisies, as well as comprehensive digital liner notes.",

            "about": "Original 2008 press release:\nChapter music is honoured to announce the first of two double disc reissues by extraordinary early 80s folk duo Kath Bloom and Loren Connors.\nMeeting in 1976 in their hometown New Haven, CT, Kath Bloom and Loren Connors formed a creative partnership that has haunted psych-folk fans ever since, releasing six albums of fragile avant-garde folk-blues in minuscule quantities, all of which now change hands for huge sums.\nAt first, Kath would act out monologues while Loren played his free-form guitar, extrapolated from Mississippi Delta and Chicago blues. But while Loren worked on his now legendary nine volume series Unaccompanied Acoustic Guitar Improvisations, he and Kath’s performances gradually became more song-based. Kath began practicing guitar among the headstones of New Haven’s Grove Street cemetery, while Loren’s idiosyncratic style had been developing since the 1960s.\nBy the early 80s, after self-releasing two limited edition live albums, the duo were playing occasionally outside of New Haven, and soon Boston independent label Ambiguous Records approached them to record their first studio effott. Acclaimed jazz critic and music historian Nat Hentoff wrote sensitive, insightful liner notes and Sing The Children Over emerged in 1982.\nSing The Children Over mixed traditional folk and blues songs with Kath’s originals, and tracks such as It’s So Hard To Come Home and The Breeze/My Baby Cries revealed Kath to be an accomplished and moving songwriter. It also set up the dynamic template that she and Loren would follow over their remaining recordings – Kath’s fragile voice and subdued finger-picked guitar set against Loren’s play- ing: abstract, skittering, sometimes atonal but always intuitively supportive. Together the duo created a sound almost impossibly emotional and haunting, one unlike anything created before or since.\nKath and Loren released three more albums - Sand In My Shoe, Restless Faithful Desperate and Moonlight, in 1983 and 84 - all on Loren’s own Saint Joan label in editions of 200-300 copies, and all featuring noth- ing but Kath’s original compositions. The last two albums will also be released by Chapter Music as a double disc set in August.\nBy 1984, however, Kath was married with a young son, and Connors himself was entering a new relationship, so the duo found themselves drifting apart. After she and Loren’s final album Moonlight in 1984, Kath did not release anything again until a 1993 solo cassette Love Explosion. She then developed a devoted cult following through the pivotal use of her song Come Here in Richard Linklater’s 1995 film Before Sunrise, and has released two solo albums on Chapter Music, including the brand new Terror.\nLoren also retreated from music for a period, focusing on other forms of writing until re-emerging in the late 1980s. He is now recognised as a pioneering guitar explorer, and has worked with the likes of Thurston Moore, Keiji Haino, Jim O’Rourke and many more.\nAnd now, after almost 25 years, Kath Bloom and Loren Connors’ original recordings are again available to be soaked up, marveled at and relished. Both double disc sets include extensive liner notes, original photos and artwork, and a treasure trove of bonus tracks!",

Angels That Fall slips deeper into Loren's headspace where vocalists in glissando and the swelling romanticism of chamber strings echo from beyond this mortal plane. Transcribed through Connors effect-laden six strings, he carries the listener from bluesy violence to sadness, hope and a piano coda.\nAngels That Fall was recorded May 2016 at First Unitarian Congregational Society in Brooklyn, NY.",

            "about": "As Roses Bow: Collected Airs 1992-2002 is Loren Connors' assembly of his most melodically rich and stunning miniature compositions. Inspired by O'Carolan's airs and other Irish airs of the past, these works, recorded during a ten year period, are melded with the distinctly personal and iconoclast adaptation of Connors' blues.\nThese 43 pieces are Connors' complete airs, culled from 10 albums (eight of which are out of print) and one single, including his groundbreaking Hell's Kitchen Park (Black Label, 1993), Moonyean (Road Cone, 1994), as well as obscure titles like St. Vincent's Newsboy Home (Item Recordings, 1998) and Lullaby (Carbon, 2001) plus four unreleased airs. Nearly the entire critically heralded Airs (Road Cone 1999) is remastered and included as well. A timeless collection of the most gorgeous and accessible work from one of America's most iconoclast artists. Vocalist and long-time collaborator Suzanne Langille appears on four pieces.\nAlso includes pieces from Five Points EP (Table of the Elements, 1994), 9th Avenue (Black Label 1995), Calloden Harvest (Road Cone, 1997), Evangeline (Road Cone, 1998), Standing Upright on a Curve (1998), and Sails (Table of the Elements, 2006). Remastered by Jim O'Rourke.",

            "about": "Acclaimed guitar duo Loren Connors and Alan Licht celebrate their 30-year collaboration in 2023 with the release of their eighth album — At The Top Of The Stairs —and a series of performances. The duo will hold a two-night residence at Cafe OTO in London on May 5 and 6.\nAcross the decades, their improvisations became increasingly abstract and atonal while maintaining complex, ethereal arrangements. The harmonious blend of Licht's meticulously crafted feedback and harmonic patterns with Connors' ghostly blue tones remains the core sound of this partnership.\nAt the Top Of The Stairs was recorded live in 2018. Across two side-long pieces, the duo ascends slowly, through layers of atmospheric tension punctuated by thunderous waves of Connors’ effects.\nFor fifty years, Connors’s adaptation of acoustic Delta blues has transmuted into miniature grayscale compositions and howling riffs. His collaborators include Oren Ambarchi, Keiji Haino, and Kim Gordon. Connors’ second book of his paintings Night of Rain (Recital) was released last year.\nRock/experimental musician Alan Licht was a member of the bands Love Child, Run On, and Lee Ranaldo & the Dust, and has released a range of acclaimed rock and experimental albums. He is an author with books published by Rizzoli, W.W. Norton, Faber & Faber, and Blank Forms.",

            "about": "Beautiful Dreamer is a two-part suite dedicated to Steve Dalachinsky -- an original among New Yorkers and everyone else; an indefatigable supporter of the avant garde; an ingenious poet; and a close friend to Loren Connors. Connors recorded these two solo guitar pieces shortly before Dalachinsky’s passing in September 2019.\nAfterward, Connors returned to the music, and for the first time, used post-production to transform his real-time improvisations into an ethereal soundwork. It is unmistakably Connors -- a rich, ghostly tone birthed from the blues -- yet a new direction where slowness reveals a spectrum of shifting notes like a small choir, from rumbling baritones to vibrating sopranos. Beautiful Dreamer equally honors the dreams of Dalachinsky and captures the suspension of the Auguste Rodin dancer on the cover.",

            "about": "Blues: The ‘Dark Paintings’ of Mark Rothko is one of Loren Connors’ most cherished and sought after albums. Originally released in a handmade edition of 300 copies on Connors’ own St. Joan imprint in January 1990 under the name Guitar Roberts -- Blues has been unavailable in any form until now.\nAt time of its release, Connors was still an inscrutable guitarist whose matchless and alien rendering of the blues was just gaining recognition despite more than a dozen solo and collaborative releases since 1978. Connors’ classic, song-based In Pittsburgh had only been available for three months when Blues welcomed the new decade with its reformation of the blues as minimalist lines and tone; a compound of influences spanning Louisiana guitarist Robert Pete Johnson to painter Mark Rothko.\n\"Moving with the slow, stately weirdom we expect of Connors' late '80s sound, the music is all shards, all pokes in the eye, as though Rothko's gray scale had exploded, sending shrapnelized paint rocketing through your brain,\" music historian Byron Coley writes in the liner notes of this reissue. \"Just as Connors' notes ricochet hauntedly through its recesses.\"\nFor this reissue, engineer Taylor Deupree restored the audio to Connors’ specifications of how these seven instrumentals were intended to sound. Cover art is an untitled 1969 Rothko work -- a painting that influenced the album. The original LP jacket is replicated as a glossy inner sleeve. New liner notes by Coley chart Connors' development and the influence Rothko had on him as a guitarist.\nDigital download includes PDF of original and reissue album art.\nLP cover image by Mark Rothko Untitled, 1969 © 1998 Kate Rothko Prizel & Christopher Rothko / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York",

            "about": "Domain Of The Wind is a 22-minute solo electric guitar suite from Loren Connors. At times thunderous, Connors’ strikes of hand shatter melodies as single notes and chords come whipping by. The mastery use of simple effects further transfigures Connors’ ever changing blues structure into a harrowing transmission of smeared, reverberant tones.\nThis is not Connors' past space music, nor his expedition into nothingness -- but something rather heavy. The music here, like Mark Mahaney’s portrait of Connors adorning the cover, is deeply human and a reflection of life and the unknown future. Edition of 300 copies on black 10-inch vinyl -- only available directly from Family Vineyard.",

Features Suzanne Langille -- vocals, lyrics -- on \"Child\" and \"Brigid’s Song.\"\nNot only the first of the Black Label titles but the hands down classic of Connors' Venusian / street story / tear suspended electric blues. Based on the New York City Irish-American slum known as Hell’s Kitchen of the late 19th and early 20th century, Connors summons the freight trains, the death, the violence, and the poverty into an alluring and stark six-string portrait. Essential!\nLiner notes: \"The NYC Irish-American slum known as Hell’s Kitchen was in the late 19th and early 20th century, the most desperate slum in U.S. history. The level of neglect, poverty, disease, violence and pollution that existed there still remains unequalled. Eleventh Avenue, with its freight train traffic, once was known as Death Avenue.\"",

            "about": "\"The balance here between peace and struggle is what makes this music unique and special. You do not want it to end because it speaks directly to your heart.\" — Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery\nInto the Night Sky is the sixth album from avant guitarists Alan Licht and Loren Connors, the first after 2003's In France (FBWL). Since 1993 these New York City artists have evolved an instrumental dialogue merging shades of electric blues and minimalism. These two epic pieces -- one from 1996, the other from 2006 -- recorded live in concert clearly show far their desolate sound world grew over a decade of collaboration while the core of layered guitar complexities and alien melodies remain. The atmosphere conjured by the Licht-Connors duo is unmistakable -- the ebb of eloquently shaped feedback -- while the harmonic patterns recall 20th Century classical music.\nActive since the early 1990s, Licht has worked with a veritable who's who of the experimental world, from free jazz legends to iconic composers while performing in Text of Light and an ongoing duo with Aki Onda. Since 1978 Connors has released dozens of acclaimed and sought-after LPs documenting his singular adaption of the blues and forging his place as one of America's most iconoclastic artists.\nTrack 1 recorded Nov. 23, 1996, at Mercury Lounge.\nTrack 2 recorded March 24, 2006, at Yoga Sutra.",

            "about": "Leone is the first meeting of electric guitarists Loren Connors and Oren Ambarchi. It’s somewhat surprising it’s taken this long as these two are connected by ongoing collaborators, like Jim O’Rourke and Keiji Haino. Connors, for more than 40 years, has continued to develop an iconic sound tethered to radical permutations of the blues. Ambarchi’s own multi-decade transfiguration of the guitar inhabits a rarefied realm of abstracted tones and dissonance pitched between improvisation and composition.\nThis album, like its title, is a sum of parts: solo performances by Connors and Ambarchi bookend a duo. On “Lorn,” Connors unravels an aggressive ternary form, with an opening section wrapped in distortion and extreme phasing that contrasts against ghostly, distant single notes. This side-long piece is a dramatic six-string reimagination of Connors’ beloved vocal arias. Ambarchi’s “Nor,” supplants a guitar performance with melodic, shifting organ-like tones that are swallowed into a fluttering, glitchy squall. The harmonics and pace is similar in complexity to Ambarchi’s most recent album, Simian Angel (Editions Mego).\nOn “Ronnel,” the duo, each audio landscape created by the two slowly rotates and overlaps the other. Connors’ lightly traced blue and black notes are boldly punctuated by Ambarchi’s bright bass-like pulses and ebullient synthy colors. It’s as if each is drawing the others’ portrait on opposite sides of a translucent sheet.",

            "about": "Debut release by the perfectly matched guitar duo of Loren Connors and Clint Heidorn, recorded at Our Lady of Lebanon Cathedral in Brooklyn during their first meeting. As in all Connors’ music the blues is a monophonic foundation permeating the atmosphere - and this is no exception. Yet as ghost tones flicker, shimmering melodies collapse into a speaker rattling brume that is epic and startling as Giacinto Scelsi’ string quartets. This is Connors and Heidorn as a chamber symphony propelled into electricity and six string clusters.\nBy now, Connors needs no introduction. The music of the Brooklyn-based artist was recently described by Jon Dale as \"a loneliness that’s almost devastating in its purity. At its best, Connors’ music works at a cellular level, as though the fundamental nature of the piece is implicit in the very first note played: a flower just ready to bloom.\"\nHeidorn is a composer and guitarist based in Los Angeles, California. His first album, Atwater, was released on his own Ashes, Ashes Publishing imprint in October of 2011. Deeply personal, his music explores simple melodies, themes of death and futility, and the sounds and impressions of his native Southern California. Atwater was followed in Fall 2012 with +33° 58' 41.85\", -117° 49' 13.74\", a limited edition release about the oak tree near his childhood home.\nLight is Connor's third one-sided 12\" released by Family Vineyard. Light was recorded recorded by Issue Project Room and mastered by Taylor Dupree at 12k Mastering.",

            "about": "Live in New York is an album seemingly simple as its title. Yet Loren Connors -- captured here in cinéma vérité quality at two performances six days apart in November 2014 -- is anything but straightforward. During the past 40 years the guitarist has not only developed an iconic sound but continues to reshape it and challenge himself, and the listener, in accepting radical permutations of the blues.\nAcross these three pieces, Connors builds upon the vision captured on his last studio album, 2011's Red Mars, where transparent, ghostly notes slowly unravel against a canvas of black drones and funeral tolls. In addition -- maximist, distorted six-string solos, that were once a hallmark of Loren's early-90s performances, make a mighty return.",

            "about": "Loren Connors, now 75, remains an unstoppable force of creative expression. As his vast catalog of recordings continues to be reissued, and his visual art finds new audiences, he still moves forward—improvising in real time, forging his own path through a spectral, mutated form of the blues.\nNightfall is one of two new 10-inch records out now on Family Vineyard, and is among his most haunting. Dark and meditative, the music breathes in hushed tones, its melodies emerging from the shadows with Connors’ quiet, unshakable intensity. At times droning and immersive, at others achingly melodic, it carries a sense of time stretched and suspended—another chapter in Connors’ singular, ever-evolving sound world.\nConnors music continues to be a world unto itself: delicate yet raw, evoking the ghosts of early American blues while dissolving into an ethereal, near-impressionistic haze. Connors’ guitar whispers, bends, and sighs, carving out space in a way that feels both ancient and entirely of the moment. His spontaneous compositions possess an emotional gravity that transcends technicality, drawing listeners into an intimate, dreamlike state.\nNightfall’s counterpart—Spitfire, another 10” out now, is the opposite—restless and alive with electricity.",

            "about": "Loren Connors has long been heralded as one of the country's most inimitable guitar voices. Like kindred spirit John Fahey, Connors' legacy began by quietly self-releasing a series of raw and embryonic LPs. Since the late 1970s, Connors' use of haunted Delta Blues, minimalism and compositional underpinnings have become an avant-garde style synonymous to him. Along the way, musicians diverse as Chan Marshall, Keiji Haino, Darin Gray, Jim O'Rourke, Jandek, and Alan Licht have sought Connors as a musical partner on record and stage.\nRed Mars is the first CD of new solo music by the New York City guitarist since 2004's The Departing of a Dream Vol III: Juliet. Since that time, Connors' unmistakable electric blues style presented on album has changed somewhat -- from multilayer tape-recorded pieces to spontaneous live performances. The five pieces here, a suite to the Red Planet, are filled of the cinematic pacing, lyricism and a palette of phantom tones that hoist Connors to a stunning new peak. Portuguese bassist Margarida Garcia joins Connors on the opening journey, introducing a dialogue unique in its ambiance as its entwined mystery and melodies. Features cover artwork by Connors.\n© Loren Connors and Family Vineyard. All rights reserved.\nTo purchase Loren Connors on CD, please visit www.family-vineyard.com.D",

            "about": "\"I would go as far as to say that the few recordings that exist of these Robert Crotty sessions are among the finest and most beautiful blues documents of all time.\" -- Loren Connors\nIn the years 1978 to 1981, Robert Crotty would show up on Loren Connors’ doorstep in New Haven, Connecticut with his tiny, almost toy guitar. The two would then spend hours playing acoustic blues, the likes of which was absolutely staggering in its truthfulness.\n\"Robert Crotty with Me: Loren’s Collection (1979-1987)\" is the first anthology of the late bluesman’s work, as selected by his former playing partner. These are the unheard tapes of Crotty and Connors communing with the spirits of Delta and County Blues through their own revisions of standards and tingle-inducing improvisations. These also some of the legendary Connors' earliest available recordings showing the development of iconoclast guitar style and vocal moan.\nCrotty was a New Haven lifer and linchpin of the region’s blues scene yet, he never achieved much recognition outside local bars and house parties -- until now. The album features never before heard recordings, unseen photos, liner notes by Connors and Crotty’s brother",

            "about": "Loren Connors, now 75, remains an unstoppable force of creative expression. As his vast catalog of recordings continues to be reissued, and his visual art finds new audiences, he still moves forward—improvising in real time, forging his own path through a spectral, mutated form of the blues.\nSpitfire is one of two new 10-inch records out now on Family Vineyard, it’s restless and alive with electricity. This is Connors at his most physical, wrenching sound from his guitar with forceful, percussive strikes. Notes crack and fracture, vibrating through the amplifier like sudden sparks. While still carrying his signature spectral quality, Spitfire moves with intent, never settling into meditation. It flickers, erupts, and fades like the last moments of a fire burning out.\nConnors music continues to be a world unto itself: delicate yet raw, evoking the ghosts of early American blues while dissolving into an ethereal, near-impressionistic haze. Connors’ guitar whispers, bends, and sighs, carving out space in a way that feels both ancient and entirely of the moment. His spontaneous compositions possess an emotional gravity that transcends technicality, drawing listeners into an intimate, dreamlike state.\nSpitfire’s counterpart—Nightfall, another 10” out now, is among Connors’ most haunting.",

            "about": "Originally released 1999 on Item Recordings, 9901D CD, as Loren MazzaCane Connors. Reissued digitally by Family Vineyard in 2007. Recorded 1995-1998. Cover photo by Frederick Detlefsen, 1902.\n\"'Extra, extra! Read all about it!!' Everyone is familiar with this cry from the newspaper boys of the past. What is not commonly known, though, is that these boys, many of Irish background, were orphans without homes who all too often starved or froze to death in the street. A Room Catholic priest, Father Drumgoole, witnessed these tragedies and decided to build a home for orphaned kids, with he accompanied in the early years of this century. It was named St. Vincent's Newsboy Home, and today continues as the largest facility of its kind in the country.\" -- Loren Connors, 1999\n\"... one of the more obscure and hard-to-find entries in Connors' oeuvre. Strange, considering it's also one of his more gorgeous affairs, an all-too brief collection of Spartan guitar movements and bittersweet remembrances. Simply recorded, tracks like 'Angels of the Rooftops' and 'Doorsteps' echo off into the distance, as Connors carefully sounds his notes and allows them to linger ever so slightly.\" -- Other Music",

            "about": "In 1981 guitarist Loren Connors took his tape recorder to the graveyard where the legendary Midnight Mary's grave lies in New Haven, Connecticut. The curse is: Anyone who gets caught in her graveyard past midnight will die the next day. But Connors, like a young fool, taped in that place, making this album.\nLost and forgotten, a cassette of this music -- made at Evergreen Cemetery -- was found by chance in 2008. Recorded between Connors' eight volume Unaccompanied Acoustic Guitar Improvisations LP series and the folk albums he would make with Kath Bloom, these nine pieces meld those distinct, haunting styles. Connors, singing in a trance like moan, reforms the Mississippi Delta blues on acoustic guitar with flashes of melodic hooks and a percussive guitar style that erupts into boogie-woogie riffs and other world spirituals.\nIt's an album for followers of Connors' spine tingling solo albums and his collaborations with Suzanne Langille or Jandek. Devotees of early 20th Century blues artists such as Blind Willie Johnson or Charley Patton will be equally enthralled. A rare and essential peak into the still mysterious early years of this American guitar master.",

            "about": "Reissue of master guitarist Loren Connors' modern classic The Departing of a Dream -- the first of what would become a three volume series based loosely as tribute to Miles Davis' \"He Loved Him Madly.\" This album finds Connors exploring slowly churned darkened hues and signature ghost melodies, each collapsing onto themselves like echoes of Miles' muted trumpet.\nSince the late 1970s, Connors' use of haunted Delta Blues, minimalism and compositional underpinnings have become an avant-garde style synonymous to him. When The Departing of a Dream was released as a CD in 2002 it signaled a dramatic growth in Connors' sound by combining electric, acoustic and bass guitar with the unsettling menage of rustling and ambient hiss. Remastered from the original tapes this new version extends the closing two-part suite \"For NY 9/11/01\" with the bonus track \"Pretty as Ever,\" one of Connors’ most enduring melodies recontextualized as a final glimmer of hope in this blackened meditation.",

            "about": "Loren Connors (aka Loren MazzaCane Connors) returns with the sequel to 2002's critically acclaimed The Departing of a Dream. The NYC blues guitarist, who has been recording and releasing albums since 1978, extends the theme (which was a loose tribute to Miles Davis' \"He Loved Him Madly\") into a fragile and floating eight-part piece of acoustic/electric/ and bass guitar mixed with field recordings and the unsettling menage of found sounds and ambient hiss. Whereas the first volume smoldered into a dark meditation with hardly a glimpse of light, Departing II offers notes of hope in the form of lifting melodic airs and distant bird calls. Replicating the sound of Davis' muted trumpet through extended guitar and recording techniques, Loren has created another startling and unique album of despair and awakening that can stand next to previous classics In Pittsburgh or Hell's Kitchen Park.\n\"... like an audio analogue to the canvases of Mark Rothko. The color is the blues, not because the music plays with the 12-bar form but because that's the mood, like tears suspended in a cloud that never breaks.\" -- Alec Hanley Bemis, LA Weekly",

            "about": "\"You can't hold on to things,\" Loren Connors says. \"With great happiness comes great sorrow.\" So brings us to the spectrum that is Departing of a Dream Vol. III: Juliet. Like the previous volumes, Juliet is a tribute of sorts; and here the focus is clearly love, the kind of love willing to face desolation and ultimately death. Recorded in Connors's Brooklyn apartment, his electric guitar emits a pulsing web of blues notes that settle against the utterly intimate human ambience of a creaking chair, tumbling objects, smoke curled absence and his signature canvas of tape hiss. The story of Juliet and her Romeo is told in a lyrical outpouring that Connors has rarely shown in recent years, a style associated which his Rooms (1990) and Evangeline (1999) albums. Though the 20-minute album opener contains a devastating core of mire and foreboding that only Connors can create.\n\"Connors' gentle guitar music conjures up ghosts, representations of loneliness, sadness and introspection. Gentle mists hover above the unkempt gravestones of the disenfranchised souls of love lost. \" -- Spencer Grady, Dusted\nCD out of print.",

            "about": "After ten years, guitarist Loren Connors returns to his much acclaimed and beloved The Departing of a Dream series. Initially based loosely as tribute to Miles Davis' masterwork \"He Loved Him Madly,\" Connors delves further into the inspiration to explore melody as a slow-moving spectrum of shades projected against a fragile, often decaying ambience.\nVolume Five continues the theme, as Connors coaxes complex blues mutations and wide swathes of distant vibrating tones -- not unlike the expressionistic cry of Miles' horn. The flutter of voices and din that seep in between the sustained notes transform into a choir as only Connors can lead.",

            "about": "The Departing of a Dream, Vol. VII is the debut collaboration between two giants of the New York avant-garde ­— guitarist Loren Connors and saxophonist/trumpeter Daniel Carter. It's a gorgeous, languorous soundscape distilled from the darkest reaches of blues and jazz.\nFor nearly 17 years Connors has used the Departing series to continue his meditation on Miles Davis' epic \"He Loved Him Madly\" and expand his efforts to create disappearing music. The duo does just that, vanishing behind decaying trumpet drones and choral-like sheets of electric strings.\nCarter and Connors both active since the mid-1970s only began performing together in the past year.\nCarter is a master improviser on assorted horns and reeds and known as a member of the legendary NYC ecstatic/creative improvisational groups Other Dimensions In Music and Test and for accompanying everyone from Sun Ra, Yo La Tengo, and Matthew Shipp.\nConnors has released records of his singular guitar improvisations and compositions since 1978. A few past Connors' albums contained saxes and more -- Come Night (1991) and Hoffman Estates (1998) --, but those were overdub, studio affairs. Here, Connors responds in real-time, processing effects and crafting an intimate world, shimmering like a black crystal.",

            "about": "The Lost Mariner is an improvised dialogue between avant blue legend Loren Connors and bassist Darin Gray (On Fillmore, Dazzling Killmen, Brise-Glace, Grand Ulena, etc.). Structure is there, but it roams as it sways, constantly adjusting and reinventing itself as the two react to its mysterious design. Their delicate whispers are as eloquent as many improvisors' loudest howls.\n\"Gray is an articulate and compelling melodist; in places Connors responds to him by twisting melancholy counter-melodies around his like ivory around wrought iron, but elsewhere he uses effects to turn his usually distinct notes into black, cavernous sound masses that aptly frame Gray's extrapolations.\" -- Bill Meyer, Signal to Noise",

It’s wrenching as his glorious ‘airs’ or the distortion mangled screams of his blues.",

It is meant to be listened as an entire work, so that is the way it should be approached. That familiar haunting ghost-like melancholy tone and naked beauty is ever so elegant and touching. Darin Gray is perhaps Loren's most sympathetic partner -- he always balances the bottom with a warm and enchanting vibration which hovers in dark clouds and cushions the pain, terror and loneliness of Loren's majestic distortion -- digging deeper into the abyss and pouring out his guts for all to witness!\" -- Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery, NYC",

            "about": "Tom Carter and Loren Connors are a pairing so obvious, it’s a mystery how it took this long to happen. Each has traversed the American underground on their own unique path. Carter co-founded acid-folk improvisers Charalambides in 1991 and Connors has been redefining his singular vision of the blues since the late 1970s.\nOn this debut non-titled LP, these guitar masters conjure a stunning, and at times labyrinthine, six-string tableau. Carter’s high-contrast spiral melodies sear through Connors’ expanding canvas of blacks and molten reds. It’s a startling and new language of psychedelic and avant blues that is a next step in Carter and Connor’s ongoing exploration of the guitar.",

            "about": "Loren Mazzacane Connors' *9th Avenue* is a haunting exploration of minimalist blues, infused with an experimental edge that defies conventional boundaries. The album’s sparse guitar work, drenched in lo-fi aesthetics, creates an atmosphere that is both intimate and eerie, evoking the quiet, lonely streets of New York City after midnight. The subtle use of dissonance and delicate melodies reflects Connors' mastery of tension and release, drawing the listener into a world of deep introspection.\nEach track on *9th Avenue* is a sonic vignette, capturing fleeting emotions and fragmented memories. The ambient soundscapes, reminiscent of impressionist art, allow the listener to fill in the spaces with their own imagination, making the experience deeply personal. Connors' ability to convey such profound emotion through minimalistic arrangements is a testament to his genius, making this album a timeless piece in the avant-garde blues genre.\nThe BPM across the tracks is generally slow, reflecting the contemplative mood that permeates the album. The use of subtle dynamics and the interplay between silence and sound further enhances the introspective quality of the music. *9th Avenue* is not just an album to listen to; it's an album to experience, offering a deep emotional journey for those willing to immerse themselves in its quiet beauty.",

            "about": "Calloden Harvest by Loren Mazzacane Connors is a haunting exploration of minimalist ambient soundscapes, blending the raw emotion of blues with experimental avant-garde sensibilities. The album captures a deep sense of melancholy and reflection, drawing listeners into a world where each note reverberates with profound significance. The slow, droning pace of the compositions creates an almost meditative atmosphere, allowing one to immerse fully in the textured layers of guitar work that Connors is renowned for.\n!The album is a journey through solitude and introspection, where the sparse, yet powerful instrumentation evokes images of desolate landscapes and fading memories. Connors' ability to convey such depth of emotion with minimalistic arrangements is a testament to his mastery of the ambient genre. The subtle shifts in tone and the delicate interplay between silence and sound make this album a compelling experience for those who appreciate the art of restraint.\n!Overall, Calloden Harvest stands as a powerful statement in Loren Mazzacane Connors' discography, demonstrating his ability to craft deeply emotional and atmospheric pieces that resonate long after the music has stopped. It is an essential listen for fans of ambient, experimental, and avant-garde music.",

            "about": "Crucible by Loren Mazzacane Connors & Suzanne Langille is a profound exploration of the raw emotional landscapes that can be sculpted through minimalistic yet deeply evocative sounds. The album resides at the intersection of experimental blues and avant-garde, creating a sound that is both hauntingly intimate and expansively atmospheric.\nEach track seems to dwell in a space where the boundaries of music blur into a meditative state, driven by Loren's sparse guitar work and Suzanne's ethereal vocals. The album unfolds like a slow-burning journey through shadowed alleys and whispered thoughts, maintaining a delicate balance between dissonance and harmony.\nThe experimental nature of the album is not just a backdrop but the essence of its storytelling. It's an emotional crucible where each note and chord progression feels intentional, almost like a spoken word in a long-lost language of despair and hope. The drone-like qualities merge with ambient textures, creating an immersive experience that demands the listener’s full attention. This album is a quintessential listen for those who appreciate the depth of minimalistic expression in music, particularly within the realms of ambient and impressionistic soundscapes.\n!",

            "about": "Loren Mazzacane Connors' 'Departing Of A Dream Vol III: Juliet' is a haunting exploration of sound, where each note lingers like a ghostly whisper. The album immerses listeners in a deep, ambient landscape, blending elements of experimental music with the minimalism and raw emotion of blues. This is music that drifts between worlds, capturing the ephemeral beauty of love and loss through Connors' distinctive guitar work.\n!>The album’s slow, deliberate pace, with tracks that often float around a BPM of 40-60, creates a meditative atmosphere. Connors' improvisational style, combined with the drone-like qualities of the compositions, makes this album a deeply introspective experience. Each track feels like a chapter in a larger narrative, full of unresolved tension and melancholic beauty. It's an album that demands to be listened to in its entirety, as the emotional weight of each piece builds upon the last.\n!> 'Departing Of A Dream Vol III: Juliet' stands out for its unique blend of sound art and blues, where the boundaries between genres blur. It's an album that will resonate with fans of ambient music, but also with anyone who appreciates the artistry of minimalism and the emotional depth of the blues. Connors' ability to convey profound emotion with such sparse arrangements is nothing short of remarkable.",

            "about": "Loren Mazzacane Connors' *Hell's Kitchen Park* is a haunting exploration of sound, where minimalism meets the raw emotion of blues. The album immerses the listener in an eerie, yet deeply evocative atmosphere, blending ambient textures with avant-garde structures. Connors’ guitar work is sparse yet emotionally charged, each note lingering like a whispered memory. The overall mood of the album is introspective and melancholic, drawing from the dark ambient style to create an almost cinematic experience that is both meditative and unsettling.\nThe use of silence and space is as crucial as the notes themselves, creating a feeling of vast emptiness that resonates with the listener long after the music ends. Each track feels like a glimpse into a different facet of Connors’ emotional landscape, from the quiet reflection of 'Mother & Son' to the desolate beauty of 'Hell’s Kitchen Park.' The album’s structure and pacing contribute to its power, with slower BPMs that allow the listener to fully absorb the emotional depth of each piece.\nFor fans of experimental and avant-garde music, *Hell's Kitchen Park* is a profound experience. Its minimalistic approach and atmospheric qualities make it a standout in Connors' discography, offering a deep dive into the possibilities of sound as an expressive medium.",

            "about": "Loren Mazzacane Connors' *Moonyean* is a haunting journey through minimalist soundscapes, where bluesy melancholy intertwines with ambient textures to create an album that is both deeply personal and profoundly atmospheric. The music is steeped in a sense of solitude, each track unfolding like a whispered conversation with the night. The use of sparse guitar work and long, sustained notes lends the album an almost ethereal quality, pulling the listener into a contemplative state.\nThe album's experimental nature is evident in its refusal to adhere to conventional structures, favoring instead a fluid, almost improvisational approach. This gives *Moonyean* a timeless quality, as if the music exists outside of any specific era or genre. The blend of ambient, blues, and avant-garde elements creates a sound that is uniquely Connors, simultaneously meditative and disquieting.\nEach track on *Moonyean* is like a brushstroke on a dark canvas, contributing to a larger picture that is mysterious and enigmatic. The minimalist approach, coupled with the drone-like qualities, invites deep listening and reflection. This is not an album that reveals itself easily; it requires patience and an openness to its subtle nuances. For those willing to delve into its depths, *Moonyean* offers a richly rewarding experience.",

            "about": "Loren Mazzacane Connors' *Rooms* is a haunting exploration of blues through the lens of experimental and minimalistic soundscapes. The album defies traditional blues structures, instead opting for an impressionistic and lo-fi approach that resonates with deep emotional undercurrents.\nThe sparse instrumentation, often just a solitary guitar, creates a sense of isolation and introspection, perfectly complemented by Suzanne Langille's ethereal vocal contributions. Each track is a delicate balance of sound and silence, evoking a mood that is both melancholic and serene. The ambient elements further enhance the immersive experience, drawing the listener into a world where every note feels like a breath.\nThe album's freeform nature allows Connors to express his emotions without the constraints of traditional song structure, making *Rooms* a truly unique entry in the blues genre. Whether you're a fan of experimental music or simply looking for something that challenges the norm, *Rooms* offers a compelling journey through the depths of human emotion.",

The lo-fi production enhances the raw emotion, creating a sense of closeness between the listener and the performers.

The BPM is slow, around 60, giving it a solemn, reflective mood.",

            "about": "Thurston and Loren fearlessly dive into a hot, dark pool and enter a world of surging sound and faint lights. They can't see each other. They can only hear each others' searing notes in the heat. But it is enough to take them through.\nThe material on The Only Way To Go Is Straight Through was compiled from two live recordings. Side A was captured at The Stone in Manhattan, where Moore and Connors performed on July 14, 2012 for the second annual Spy Music Festival (pictured above). The pair met up again on October 17, 2012 to headline Northern Spy's CMJ showcase at Public Assembly in Brooklyn (pictured below), and that mesmerizing set became Side B of this record.\n\"Most guitarists who improvise with Loren Connors show the man some deference. Both Jim O’Rourke and Alan Licht have tended to orbit his Venusian blues, keeping his keening figures and nocturnal atmospheres in the center; Keiji Haino showed none of the calculated ignorance he sometimes uses to keep other musicians off balance. And while Thurston Moore certainly knows how to wail, in improvised contexts he tends to take his cues from his fellow musicians, matching their energy level. But deference was not on the agenda during either of the performances that make up this LP, which Northern Spy has pressed up for Record Store Day 2013 in a run of 3000. “The Stone (2012/07/14)” opens with a display of outright savagery; Moore chases down and destroys tones with the cruel agility of a WW I fighter pilot keeping an evasive opponent in his sites, while Connors pumps in continuous streams of sound that bulge in the middle like a boa constrictor that chowed down on a collection of bowling balls. Then they shift to a less propulsive but not less aggressive mode; Moore’s distorted squall scythes around Connors’ squelchy wah-wah licks, then attacks it directly. Connors takes the blows and strikes back; if these were comic book characters, they’d be fencing with outboard motors.\"\n- Dusted  (www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/7676)",
