            "about": "Recorded in Kirtipur, Nepal, March 2005. Originally released on LP limited to 300 copies. Tape manipulations, feedback, crude field recordings, & Nepali dirt. \"Side 'Beggar Master' is like a video game of a brick wall chasing a 300 pound wobble legged mosquito. High feedback intercepted by sliding horizontal pile of bricks. Beating thud heart with some open holes in the side corresponding to sludge lake bug liberation. Pumping muscle disorders team up with mud and dirt bubble bath to make larvae spawn engine. Whir and blur background mechanical swamp. The end of the 'Beggar' side cuts off immediately just as you think the whole mess of introduced sound is going to rise up and start knocking down buildings. You can hear the displaced air of the kong leg lifting and zip! The 'Prayer Flush' side starts off as a homage to prehistoric Raptors vs. the Soccer Thugs of Britain. Whistles, bites on the ass, distorted knee scrapes highlight various parts of the first few mins of screaming melee. This fades into some drawn out electro fry. The sound that no living being can stand up to: deep long forked tongue death. Hum of the end. Then the New Blockaders on the Thalid-O-Kid interrupt to make a canal of tumbling pile of canned garbage flowing into a heightened snow storm of singing trident lava-needled record players. Welcome here all trashit, submit your excessive horrible souls to our torture disparagement! If you listen close enough you might be able to hear the behemoth garbage truck rolling up everything into a black hole rear compartment. Background Killoway with his garbage can lid crook pointing the way into vortex nothing. Canned fuzz drops dead after the tidal bleach hand eliminates all movement. If you've heard it all from the Christians how scary the sounds of hell will be, you can hear from Killoway's field recording how your garbage is being treated once it's putrid soul is released. Definitely a mood soundtrack for oblivionic conoise-suers with plans to ride the flume to hell.\" -- Bonnie Banks, Brutal Sound Effects.\nOriginally released on LP in an edition of 300 copies. Reissued as a CD and still available from  www.hansonrecords.net\n****DOWNLOAD INCLUDES FULL COVER ART AND INSERTS****",

            "about": "Phone recordings from the Haunted House in the Kathmandu Fun Park in Kathmandu, Nepal.\nEntrance Soundtrack: The audio playing as you walk the path to enter the Horror House... Being blasted out of a way cheap outdoor PA speaker which is seriously blown the fuck out. I did no remixing to this audio, this is the full recording of what was looping out of the entrance speaker. There are moments of silence and just crude ripping speaker sound. It's perfect. There is a synth track in the middle of it, that my friend Ruhail Qaisar identified as the intro music to a famous Indian horror TV show. I wish I could meet who put this collage together, it definitely fucked, though I'm really glad I got to experience it through this extremely unprofessional and broken ass PA speaker.\nWalk Through 2: Walking through the pitch dark maze for my second time. Somewhere are motion sensors and when you pass them, bright light flashes, horrifying audio blasts and raw as fuck rusty machinery w/ old rotten rubber masks covered in spray paint and filth pop out at you...seriously looking like some old Survival Research Laboratories machinery that was left out in the dust & rain for 10+ years. A local Nepali couple make the walk through with us and are not having nearly as much fun as me.\nBumper Cars: Bonus track of me standing in line for the bumper cars at Kathmandu Fun Park. As with other rides at the park, these things go WAY TOO FAST, FOR WAY TOO LONG.\nGeese Feeding: Outside of the Bhoot Ghar is a small fenced in pond with a dozen or so geese. I happened to leave the Horror House one day just as the geese were being fed. Here are the geese freaking out in meal time bliss as you can hear the horror house entrance soundtrack blaring in the background as well as a nearby soccer game w/ live commentary in progress.\nWalk Through 1: My first walk through of the Bhoot Ghar. A lot of bumping into walls and laughing. I turned my phones light on at one point to find myself in an emtpry room dusty and littered with red and gold horror graffiti and a shitty old basket.\nBumper Cars: Another recording of mechanical chaos. This time the recorder is inside the bumper car with me. These things are going WAY TOO FAST.\nFerris Wheel Belt: A great rhythm made by the exposed belt of the ferris wheel. One of these broke just minutes after I rode it and people were stuck at the top for quite some time after.\nCASSETTE ONLY BONUS TRACK: My son and I riding the \"BREAKDANCER\" a teacup spinning ride that again goes way too fast...for WAY TOO LONG. There was a little guy operating out of a small booth with a little peekaboo hole. During one of our spins he winks at me...you'll hear me notice. The tape cuts off before I got sick, but you can hear me starting to have enough... The entire ride went on for about 8 minutes. We started feeling sick after 3.",

            "about": "\"With only tape loops, metal, and horns (and sometimes, it seems, metal on horns) the two side long pieces, 'Chain Shot' and 'Execution Dock' respectively, explore the ugly underbelly of noise before just scraping right through and aiming for the insides. In a genre that has quickly turned into a broad and often inaccurate description of a certain breed of every-man experimental music, Dilloway sticks to the old-fashioned definition of noise, doing battle with the materials in front of him as he continues the construction of his impressive body of work. Dilloway, a former member of noise-titans Wolf Eyes, has recently been releasing solo work that explores much more abstract and thoughtful terrain than his previous group's onslaughts. 'Chain Shot' is more a sound collage than anything, and while it is a heaping glob of muddled debris, it is also a highly controlled one. Looping samples on top of samples, Dilloway builds a slowly encroaching beast before slowly disintegrating it, bone by bone. This is some highly textural and immediately emotive soundscape work. 'Execution Dock' begins with a repeating loop of what sounds like the beginning and the end syllables of some nut's conversation with a lamppost. In the distance sounds a pained song of sorts, like a rodent's death cry, or maybe its birth one. I'm guessing maybe this is the horn, though it would be tough to be certain about much of anything here. Delayed creaks and groans float in and around as the vocal sample dissipates, leaving you sloshing through the mud puddle only to realize that its a tar pit the size of La Brea.\" -- Henry Smith\nOriginally released as an LP on THRONE HEAP  www.throneheap.com\nReissued as a CD and still available from  www.hansonrecords.net\n****DOWNLOAD INCLUDES FULL COLOR ARTWORK****",

            "about": "Side A: AARON DILLOWAY - Live Inside Sutro Cave (21:32)\nRecorded inside the Sutro Cave of San Francisco, CA, this is AARON DILLOWAY at his livest and scariest! You won't believe your ears (really, you won't!) when your ears see this living horror movie. Scenes from inside the crypt include (but are not limited to): an old man's teeth chattering, a crying baby, a charred worm corkscrewing into your dome, a party erupts ...and then the whistling. This is NOT the gentle rattling of tea cups! Windswept with sea air and performed in absolute darkness to a crowd of stunned nightcreeps, you MUST hear Live Inside Sutro Cave!!\nSide B: JIM MORRISON - Melbourne, FL 8 ~ December 1943 ↝ ∞ (20:07)\nQuite possibly the finest Doors bootleg in their entire catalog of illicit tapes, Melbourne, FL 8 ~ December 1943 ↝ ∞ is a compendium of \"other voices\" edited by SIKK LAFFTER - a rare side of James \"Jim\" Douglas Morrison and his rock troupe The Doors of Perception! 111% illegal and 112% certified cool, this recording should be banned in tens of countries if not twenties and almost wasn't pressed due to an abject amount of copyright violations. You could call it a collage but you may definitely call it a tapestry cuz this baby weaves.",

            "about": "Reissue of 2001 recording, originally released on cassette by AMERICAN TAPES. After discussing a collaboration w/ Kevin during a trip to Chicago, I found a cassette of unreleased material of myself messing with Renaissance (the band) 8-track loops on the floor of my car and handed it over. A couple days later Kevin sent me a mini-disc of his own unreleased material. The disc was caked in spilled coffee or something… I managed to clean it enough to get a few seconds of sounds from it here and there to make 8-track tape loops of.\nOne track myself using Drumm sound sources, and one track Drumm using Dilloway sound sources.\nReleased as a CD in an edition of 500 copies.\n****DOWNLOAD INCLUDES FULL COLOR ARTWORK****",

            "about": "Originally released as a Double LP in Gatefold Sleeve.\n\"…in terms of scope and ambition, Modern Jester is Dilloway's War and Peace. It covers practically all of his sonic obsessions, stretching them to lengths at which he can explore every detail and tangent.\" Marc Masters,  Pitchfork.com\npitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16330-modern-jester/\n\"There is a specific production approach to this record that works perfectly on pulling the listener in it. It has the power to transfer and guide the mind through a journey.\"--- Jackie Farrow, Sonic Escape\nsonicescape.tumblr.com/post/18498847494/aaron-dilloway-modern-jes...\n\"Those that leave the green lungs you, raise the temperature to improbable degrees and hallucinate your death.\" Bartolome Delmar Huerta, Afterpop (Babel Fish Translation from Spanish)\nafterpop.tv/2012/02/aaron-dilloway-modern-jester/\n\"Modern Jester\" is quite possibly the culmination of everything we've heard from Dilloway that's come before it. A hyper-focused monolithic double LP that distills all past phases of inspiration into a harrowing, but strangely beautiful journey.\"\n-- Fred Thomas, All Music Guide\nfredthomas.blogspot.com/2011/10/modern-jester.html\n\"From short bursts to long-form, hallucinatory epics, it's a sprawling collection that highlights every facet of Dilloway's considerable arsenal. One of the album's two side-long attacks, Look Over Your Shoulder is a lurid, subtly shifting piece with disembodied vocals and a barrage of extra-terrestrial tones that slithers into your cerebral cortex atop a funeral rhythm.\"\n-- Jeff Conklin, East Villiage Radio\nwww.eastvillageradio.com/content/content.php?id=2643\n--------------------------------------\nRecorded 2008 - 2011\nFinalized July 2011 at Tarker Mills, Oberlin, Ohio\nAaron Dilloway on Tape Loops, Percussion, Synthesizer, Metal, Voice, Tape FX.\nwith\nErika Hoffmann - Voice Source: Tremors, After The Showers\nLobo - Voice Source: Body Chaos\nThe Nevari Butchers (Dilloway, Wyatt Howland, Mick Travis) - Electronic Source: Shatter All Organized Activities\nInfinite Psychic Assistance from Twig Harper and Nate Young\nPsychotic Dissection Assistance from Tom Darksmith and John Mannion\nMastered By Peter Swanson. Cut By Rashad Becker\nIn Memory of Ruth & Merrill Herbst, Lee Hoffmann, Jack & Katherine Dilloway\n\"PEOPLE COULD SCREW UP -- YOU EXPECTED THEM TO -- BUT MACHINES ARE MADE OF FINER STUFF.

            "about": "So excited and honored to finally release the vinyl document of my realization of JOHN CAGE’s ROZART MIX. Back in the extremely strange year of 2020, I was approached by Wave Farm and John Cage Trust to stage a performance of this seldomly performed piece that Cage wrote for Alvin Lucier. The piece is comprised of 88 tape loops (one for each key of a piano), spliced together with multiple non-musical sounds played back on 12 reel to reel machines.\nIn January of 2021 I spent a wonderful and intense week researching ROZART MIX at John Cage Trust at Bard College. It was the first place I had visited during the pandemic. On October 23, 2021, with the assistance of Rose Actor-Engel, Twig Harper, C. Lavender, Quintron, Robert Turman, and John Wiese, I presented a 6 hour performance of ROZART MIX at John Cage Trust. Six hours of 12 individually amplified reel to reel tape machines, placed around multiple floors of a house, playing 88 tape loops spliced together by 5 to 175 splices, created an overwhelming and joyous environment of cacophonous sound. The performance culminated with John Wiese touching a frog for the first time as the final sound croaked through the speakers. The frog contact was just one of many magical moments that occurred during the preparation and presentation of the piece. I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed performing it. Special thanks to Galen Joseph-Hunter of Wave Farm and Laura Kuhn & Emy Martin of John Cage Trust for trusting me with this material.\n-Aaron Dilloway, May 2024",

            "about": "\"For the first half of 2005, I lived with my wife Erika in Kirtipur, Nepal. During our days, while she was studying at the Kathmandu Association For The Deaf, I was roaming the streets and villages of the Kathmandu Valley in search of sounds and music. While kickin' round the tourist district of Thamel picking up cassettes, I met a family of Snake Charmers from Haryana, India. An old man probably in his 70s or 80s, his 2 grandsons, and one of the grandson's sons. They asked if I wanted to see a show....I said Hell YES!! They gave me a show...a KILLER show... we're talkin' 3 fuckin' king cobras dancing at once, while a giant boa chilled at the side and few other random lil' snake dudes are wigglin' around here and there. I became obsessed. I had met my new best friends... Though the kind of best friends you have to pay to hang out with. They were hustlers, yes.. But that's their job... The money was well worth the shows. I spent about 3-4 days a week for the next 2 months, recording their music and their snake shows on mini-disc and videotape. I drank a lot of chiyaa with them, smoked a lot of cigarettes and bidis. They taught me how to make reeds out of bamboo, and I traded them some clothes for a snake charming horn. They call them Beens, they are also known as Pungis. These guys were the best. At the end of April they left Kathmandu, heading to Pokhara, after that it was time for them to head back home with their earnings. Man...I missed them. This is the best of the best of the recordings I made of them. There are some classic Bollywood tracks, a Nepali folk song, and a 19- minute drone journey into the head of the King Cobra. The recordings were done in stereo. A been on the left, a been on the right. A premtal (stringed percussion instrument) on the left, a premtal on the right. The stereo recording of the charmers sway creates a very disorienting stereo tremolo effect. It's almost as if you are the snake! These tracks were recorded in an alley. There is the occasional rumble of a car passing by, and the low murmur of the locals checkin' out the white kid with the fancy gadget hangin' with the snake dudes. So here it is... The Sounds of the Indian Snake Charmer.\" -- Aaron Dilloway.\nOriginally released on LP and CD.",

            "about": "Second volume of Aaron Dilloway's recordings of the Nath family of snake charmers of Haryana, India recorded in Kathmandu in 2005. This second volumes recordings are a bit more raw, originating from video and cassette recordings as opposed to the first volume's hi-fi digital recordings (don't worry..they sound JUST as disorienting!) and containing a duo track as well as the full 4 piece.\nOriginally released as a cassette in 2005, now on vinyl in an edition of 600 copies (500 on Black, 100 on marbled burgundy vinyl). Housed in a silkscreened jacket w/ the usual Hanson Droll flaps.\nOriginal notes for VOLUME ONE:\n\"For the first half of 2005, I lived with my wife Erika in Kirtipur, Nepal. During our days, while she was studying at the Kathmandu Association For The Deaf, I was roaming the streets and villages of the Kathmandu Valley in search of sounds and music. While kickin' round the tourist district of Thamel picking up cassettes, I met a family of Snake Charmers from Haryana, India. An old man probably in his 70s or 80s, his 2 grandsons, and one of the grandson's sons. They asked if I wanted to see a show....I said Hell YES!! They gave me a show...a KILLER show... we're talkin' 3 fuckin' king cobras dancing at once, while a giant boa chilled at the side and few other random lil' snake dudes are wigglin' around here and there. I became obsessed. I had met my new best friends... Though the kind of best friends you have to pay to hang out with. They were hustlers, yes.. But that's their job... The money was well worth the shows. I spent about 3-4 days a week for the next 2 months, recording their music and their snake shows on mini-disc and videotape. I drank a lot of chiyaa with them, smoked a lot of cigarettes and bidis. They taught me how to make reeds out of bamboo, and I traded them some clothes for a snake charming horn. They call them Beens, they are also known as Pungis. These guys were the best. At the end of April they left Kathmandu, heading to Pokhara, after that it was time for them to head back home with their earnings. Man...I missed them. This is the best of the best of the recordings I made of them. There are some classic Bollywood tracks, a Nepali folk song, and a 19- minute drone journey into the head of the King Cobra. The recordings were done in stereo. A been on the left, a been on the right. A premtal (stringed percussion instrument) on the left, a premtal on the right. The stereo recording of the charmers sway creates a very disorienting stereo tremolo effect. It's almost as if you are the snake! These tracks were recorded in an alley.\"",

Originally released on LP, this digipak CD version includes a bonus track collage of the 3 tracks from the duo's out-of-print False Speech cassette.\" \"Collaboration from Dilloway of Wolf Eyes et al and C Spencer Yeh of Burning Star Core, etc. Dilloway uses tape loops, tape delay, bowed tape and vocals and Yeh uses violin, voice and electronics. Recorded in 2006 in Ann Arbor, MI The Squid has a heavy Takehisa Kosugi/Taj Mahal Travellers feel, with a headier, more expansive psychedelic brainwave style than is usually associated with Dilloway. Yeh's violin flutters on phased waves of F/X while Dilloway lets off tiny looped depth-charges, exploding Yeh's elegiac drones with chattering, circular vocals, unidentifiable noise scree and long corridors of breath.\" --David Keenan, Volcanic Tongue\nORIGINALLY RELEASED ON LP & CD",

It contains a few sound sources that were later released in quite different forms on 2010's Psychic Driving Tapes and 2012's Modern Jester, as well some crudely chopped and screwed Floyd.\nSide Two is a static 40 minute side of my organs Leslie Speaker run through an old guitar synthesizer. Very lo-fi and best results when played quietly.\nIncludes bonus tracks of unreleased sound sources made on organ and guitar synth with tape delay, used and not used on the original release, as well as an alternate shorter B-side.\nOver 100 minutes of hiss filled sound.",
