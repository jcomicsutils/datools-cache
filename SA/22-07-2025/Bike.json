            "about": "Ambike was recorded at the Botany Bay studio as far back as 2011, almost immediately after moving in there and setting up my equipment. For a myriad of reasons, it is only just now seeing a release, six years later. Prefaced by the Phi-Lips EP, which collected four alternative versions of Ambike's opening cut, this EP is perhaps the most accessible and \"musical\" Bike has ever been. Created entirely live using only three drum machines, two digital synthesizers (one of them a prototype), a small mixer and a handful of FX units, it vacillates between thick dancefloor-ready bass rattlers and more experimental dub-tinged cuts that bring to mind moments from the first two Autechre LPs, among many other things. From here, it is my express intention to broaden Bike's release schedule and continue forward from this specific point of origin with the project, as I've expanded my studio since 2011 considerably and am curious what Bike might sound like, coaxed from the machines currently at hand...",

Integrating Axon with chorus and phaser FX, mid-side equalization and the MS-20 filter and external signal processor, 'Axontracs' explores the boundaries between tonal drum programming and rhythmic melodic events.\nMaximum volume yields maximum results.",

            "about": "\"Mono/Rot is a double EP (each side of the tape is an entire EP), by Brian Grainger (Aka. Milieu, Coppice Halifax, and more) as Bike. The Rot EP is a series of 6 tracks presenting a more rhythmic style for Brian. In general they feel like Aphex/Tuss doing a take on minimal dub techno, but with a certain Grainger uniqueness. On the other side, (no a or b here) Mono EP is a single long track that takes the style of the individual tracks on Rot EP, and works it into one long master track. I have to say this work is top notch, very unique and a great amount of detail to listen to. Pro-dubbed cassette tapes. Limited to 50 copies.\"\n-Cicada Shell Tapes, 2011",

            "about": "'Patchboard Utilities' is, or does, exactly what the title would imply. It is a collection of tracks that are less meant as music or compositions in any traditional sense, and more as exercises or experiments that find a greater purpose being used as modulation sources for other Bike tracks (such as the immensely complex 'Telefaun'). These pieces, in this way, are meant to inform peaks and valleys and dynamic mathematical information, allowing for the shape of the sound to color other sounds, without actually integrating the audio itself. They are meant for envelope followers/generators, knob sweeps and all manner of automation, as well as audio-rate modulation for modular synthesizers and processors, all while being offered here, naked, in their honest and raw forms.",

            "about": "Somehow, despite recording several sessions of Bike material in the time following the 'Rangefinder' EP-triptych, there has not been a Bike release since then, three years ago, almost to the day. Bike has certainly not ceased to exist as a project, but merely entered an unexpected hibernation, it seems.\nSo, with that said, I am happy to publish a new Bike recording once again, right on time for the decay of Autumn. 'Phrygian' is a nearly forty-minute EP that originated as a nearly-complete live session in late September of '22, using only Karplus-Strong machines in my modular system as drum voices. Post-processing work, as well as some editing and overdubbing, was enacted after pulling the recording from the shelf in Autumn '23, and this included more audio generated with Karplus-Strong devices, as well as a small amount of assistance from other drum voices in the modular (Noise Reap Foundation, Bastl Tea Kick/Noise Square, Mutable Inst. Braids) and some live FX work with the Boss RE-202, a modern remake of the RE-201 Space Echo unit.\nAltogether, 'Phrygian' is as Bike as Bike can get, directly following 'Rangefinder' with more modular exploration, but with a sharpened rhythmic focus, even though 'Phrygian' certainly wanders from the grid when it wants. It is primarily concerned with coaxing rhythmic structures that remain somewhat tonal from two Doepfer A-188 bucket brigade delay units (256 and 1024 stages, respectively), which are able to perform a myriad of functions and utilities in a modular system, but are absolutely bestial when it comes to percussion work. An unexpected side of the Karplus-Strong synthesis process, 'Phrygian' hopefully transcends the 'proof of concept' part of its origination and offers a wild wonderland of alien electronics.",

These tracks have been created live with very little post-processing, using a custom built modular synthesizer rig and a single Korg analog drum machine. RANGEFINDER sees/hears BIKE reapproaching the format of a serialized release schedule, in a post-Facks Tracks landscape that accumulates all of the textural mutations and technoid design work that came before, and translates it through new machines, new designs, new structures waiting to be imagined or built. Influenced by Autechre's live recordings as well as Pan Sonic, Omit and other perennial shadows cast, BIKE continues to explore the liminal space between MILIEU albums and the COPPICE HALIFAX DEEP EARTH series recordings.",

            "about": "The third of three new BIKE EPs in a triptych micro-series called RANGEFINDER. These tracks have been created live with very little post-processing, using a custom built modular synthesizer rig and a single Korg analog drum machine. RANGEFINDER sees/hears BIKE reapproaching the format of a serialized release schedule, in a post-Facks Tracks landscape that accumulates all of the textural mutations and technoid design work that came before, and translates it through new machines, new designs, new structures waiting to be imagined or built. Influenced by Autechre's live recordings as well as Pan Sonic, Omit and other perennial shadows cast, BIKE continues to explore the liminal space between MILIEU albums and the COPPICE HALIFAX DEEP EARTH series recordings.",
            "credits": "released October 2, 2020\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded live at White Pillar, July 2020, using the R-EW modular motherbrain and a Korg Volca Beats drum machine, channeled through a Mackie ProFX8 mixer with a Moog ring modulator on the aux send. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Photography, text and design by ABM&D. This is Milieu Music number MML147C.  www.milieu-music.com  /  www.analogbotany.com",

            "about": "SUGARCUBE TEETH is a set of three tracks that were all recorded in multiple phases, with different hardware and software configs, on different dates from 2021 to 2024.\n\"Sugar\" consists of six modules from the Buchla 200 system put to work as a drum machine with bass and chordal elements, paired with the six-operator FM synth Synprez and some break chopping via the 2HP Play mono sampler, alongside a cheeky loop from Donny Benet mangled in the jaws of so many reprocessors, which include Arturia's EFX Refract.\n\"Cube\" emerged almost fully formed from Waldorf's D-Pole, a unique digital processor that is both a sound generator and an effects processor, with neither option really behaving as one might traditionally expect. D-Pole combines delay paths, resonant filters, ring modulation, bit reduction and an array of modulators to do what it does, needing only simple trigger inputs and a sequencer to build the main structure of \"Cube.\" The interwoven melodic elements were created using the aforementioned 6-operator FM synthesizer Synprez in conjunction with Goldwave's Frequency Blend algorithm.\n\"Teeth\" is the oldest of the group, with the main rhythmic skeleton recorded in late 2021 using several resonator/Karplus Strong softsynths, many of which are now deprecated designs from Audio Damage and MDA. This session was migrated into a more mutant configuration, consisting of several Arturia filters and an Audio Damage rhythmic re-arranger, with overlaid bass/pads from the 6-operator FM synths Sytrus and Synprez, and the occasional line of sound emanating from Waldorf's PPG Wave 3v, with FX proc by Airwindows.",

            "about": "'Telefaun' is the result of a procedural experiment in modulation, applied to a twenty-minute section of a Bike live session broadcast on May 20, 2023. Using all five tracks from the 'Patchboard Utilities' EP to create individual envelopes, 'Telefaun' directs these envelopes to a complex array of modulation controls - initially five volume envelopes applied to five different mid-side equalized renders of the same live session audio, then subsequently multed and inverted in various ways to control stereo panning, filter sweeps and other audio sculpting tools. The result is a swirling soundworld that never sits still, a surrealist landscape of total modular serialism, with other Bike tracks fulfilling their intended purpose as tools in an aural displacement map.",

            "about": "THAYRON BAZARDO is a set of two (for now) EP volumes collecting various outtakes, experiments and other Bike hodgepodge from the overcrowded hard-drives and organizing those materials into something semi-coherent. There are obvious nods to the benchmarks in this approach of working - AFX's Analogue Bubblebaths 3 and 4, Ovuca's Onclements, et al - and the hope is always that what my ears found fascinating enough to set aside to \"do something with later on\" remains interesting to you, on the other side of this screen. Most of these tracks were recorded simply during the process of learning one or more pieces of hard/software, and were not created with publishing or proper mastering in mind, so your mileage may vary. For the trainspotters, as per usual, equipment configurations are in the track info pages.",

            "about": "THAYRON BAZARDO is a set of two (for now) EP volumes collecting various outtakes, experiments and other Bike hodgepodge from the overcrowded hard-drives and organizing those materials into something semi-coherent. There are obvious nods to the benchmarks in this approach of working - AFX's Analogue Bubblebaths 3 and 4, Ovuca's Onclements, et al - and the hope is always that what my ears found fascinating enough to set aside to \"do something with later on\" remains interesting to you, on the other side of this screen. Most of these tracks were recorded simply during the process of learning one or more pieces of hard/software, and were not created with publishing or proper mastering in mind, so your mileage may vary. For the trainspotters, as per usual, equipment configurations are in the track info pages.",
