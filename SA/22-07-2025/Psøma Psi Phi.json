            "about": "256Hz|384Hz is the first of several planned excursions from Multidimensional Being, and while this release inhabits the main Ps Ps Ph catalog, subsequent releases will be issued via a new BE subcatalog. This album collects six recordings built using two Hewlett-Packard oscillators, and beyond this, we do not know too much about it. Upon listening, we are slowed down to the point of stillness by the finely focused tones ringing in a beautiful tuned unison, shimmering like a sun ray on the surface of a metallic silver lake. Multidimensional Being offers us equal amounts of richness in both musical and pure sound design terms, and these pieces will find useful purpose-led listening with patrons of the label who meditate or attempt to enter a gnostic state through various approaches. 256Hz|384Hz is an intimate offering of drone synthesis and high-fidelity audio design minimalism, recommended for fans of David Burraston, Eliane Radigue, Eleh or Richard Chartier.",

            "about": "'A Certain Frequency' is a beautifully disconnected album of two extended ambient assemblages by Yama Yuki, a Japanese musician working under the name odoma. Initially drafted in a process of investigating specific audio frequencies that were reputed to have so-called healing effects when listened to, Yama Yuki instead found richer results by following a more intuitive and personal path toward his goal, rather than attempting to force something to manifest where it was not. What we hear on the album is a soporific combination of ambient electronics and minimalist synthesis over a bed of field recordings, very much addressing the form and function of what used to be called new age music, while also remaining contemporaneous in the landscape of modern beatless music and holistic experimentation. 'A Certain Frequency' is a gorgeous album that might just bring the blooms and green foliage of Spring back early from the bitter Winter this year, and Yama Yuki's studied approach to this form of music yields new fruits with each new listen. An absolutely recommended album for fans of Eliane Radigue, early Eno and much of the prior Psoma catalog.",

            "about": "\"A gesture out of place\" - he heard his own voice say, as if it were a recording. He had no memory of speaking the phrase, or what it could have meant. It did not even sound like him, to his thinking, beyond the surface-level tonality of his voice. \"Like someone using my voice to speak\" he thought, in another more transparent voice in his own mind, then wondered about this too, and the dark implications it left him unable to shake.\nHe stood up, and found that his clothes were caked in dried mud, and brushing it off he winced at the newfound pain of an apparent bullet wound in his arm. He reached his other hand up to the point where he perceived the strongest level of injury, and instead found he, or someone other than he, had already bandaged it, and quite neatly also, which contrasted against his otherwise disheveled appearance.\nHe was standing in a dried out vista, small dying plants dotting a wide and slowly descending landscape, which seemed to be meant for the water of a lake, only now it was filled with sun-cracked soil. In the half-moment between blinking and opening his eyes again, he saw it as he'd imagined it - perhaps even as it once was - filled with glimmering silver water, and something else, floating along the surface of it, which he could not identify, although it did nothing but unsettle him further to think about what might have been floating there, and also why he could not identify it.\nStarting to move, he felt the dull weight of something heavy and metallic shift in his coat pocket - he reached up to grasp it and before he found the object, that transparent voice in his mind told him what it would be. The gun looked strange when he held it out before him, more like a tool or some type of multipurpose technology than a dark metal pistol to match the barren landscape. \"Doesn't look like the wild West to me\" he absentmindedly mumbled, and then for a moment considered what about his situation did look like the wild West? Nothing immediate came to mind, but he couldn't shake the sense that this assessment of where - and perhaps when - he found himself was indeed the correct assessment to make.\nIt was then he began to notice the strange fluttering noise, which was sometimes a noise and sometimes a physical sensation, like someone running a cold wire up his spine and neck. When this happened, his vision stuttered, although this was less alarming to realize than his observation of his surroundings filling in and out intermittently with buildings, people, horses and changing weather, everything spinning out of focus, slipping into reality for just a millisecond at a time, never enough to fully comprehend it, but always feeling as if, whoever the people were in these micro-hallucinations, they were seeing him blink in and out before them also.\nAnd just like they began, one such jittering incident snapped, and he was now standing beneath a night sky littered with stars, his clothes different now, cleaner, his wound gone entirely. Before him was a wooden chair sitting empty in a dirt road, oddly set next to an old record player, which was wearily unspooling some distorted piano music at the wrong speed. He found himself compelled to approach the scene, sensing somehow that the chair was meant for him, and unable to force his body from doing so, despite his mind reeling with confusion and wonder at these new surroundings. He saw his jacketed arm reach out and hold the back of the chair as he sat down in it, then waited for something to happen.\nHe couldn't imagine what would come next - how could he? His only hope, vain though it may have been, was that this were some strange dream he'd soon awake from, only later able to piece together what he had seen into something that made sense. The fluttering began again, this time moving the sun above him in the sky from noon to sunset and back again in some glitched zoetrope, scattering light everywhere, oscillating into a stomach-churning whine of metal sound, bending and modulating, every moment of it more unnatural than the last, until, behind him - a click - and blackness.\nIt was some time later when he awoke again, though this time he would have completely forgotten the prior events. Not because he could no longer remember them, but because someone else had taken the liberty for him, and helped him clear his head. He opened his eyes, seeing a grey stone room, lit subtly by a fluorescent somewhere out of view, and before him, a door in the unadorned wall opened. A woman stepped in, blonde and slim, but with a slight angled jawline that added a complexity to his assessment of her character, wearing a rather dated blue dress. He knew he'd seen her somewhere before, several times in fact, but he was surprised to find he could no longer remember her name, or really anything about her at all. He tried to speak up and ask what was happening, but also found he could not speak. Something whirred inside of him, prompting the transparent voice to again seep up and inform him, in not speech but shapes and letters, that he would be permitted to speak when he was prompted to.\nThe nameless woman sat down in her own chair in front of him, and smiled. She too seemed to know who he was, and he could only feel shame at being prostrated here before her unable to define what was happening to him. She reached beneath her chair and picked up an object that had been sitting on the floor, and held it facing him directly. He'd never seen such a thing before - unremarkable, yes - but why then was she holding it before him as she now was? With her face unchanged, clearly not anticipating his answer or reaction, she finally spake: \"What do you see?\" and something very small, and very far back in his mind, unlatched then, animating his tongue into the vibration of speech, and although he himself could not think of anything to say, he found his body answering for him instead.\n\"It doesn't look like anything to me\"",

            "about": "Given the doom barking at our bunker door from the now-cursed valley, this abyssal tome arrived as a demo in our post office box at an apt time. Douglas J. Needles hails from California, where he's managed to repurpose broken office telecommunication equipment and outdated computers, and put them to work as unorthodox tone generators and data carriers. The result is a longform void of shuddering textures that cower in the shadows of monolithic sawtooth tones, omnipresent and omniscient, only occasionally escalating their emotionless hum into a red sweep of noise and whine, scanning the landscape they now dominate.\nWhile some of you are no doubt seeking the opposite of such an experience in these dark times, recordings that offer hope and soothing balms, it is important to remember that frustration and depression are also equal reminders of our humanity, furious and illogical and undying in the face of certain destruction. A6TB-94 offers a potent echo of all your anger and downtrodden emotions, and alleviates you of the burden of bearing those things alone. It understands, and it agrees, and after communing with and confronting these necessary aspects of ourselves, only then can we begin to truly feel comforted.",

Recorded prior to PRESENCE, Ps√∏ma 17 is similarly a longform and minimal piece, built from long-distance file exchanges of different treatments and processing paths applied to a no-input mixer feedback session, originally laid to tape in Grainger's White Pillar studio, sometime around September 2018. Between the two of the far-separated artists, a transcontinental sonic exchange happened, with as little dialogue as possible - music as a reactive and observable environment for wordless methods of communication to take place. In the end, the resultant recording is a beautiful warmth of tones, softly bathed in the white noise of analog processing, round and carefully filtered to pronounce contours and subtle pulses moving beneath the surface of the drone - evidence of depth and implied pasts that, after time and careful consideration, are reduced to shadows and traces of previous forms, now echoes worn away in the erosion of resynthesis.",

            "about": "Ameliorator is the first work issued by Ps√∏ma Psi Phi, a boutique imprint specializing in many different shades of beatless sound. Created using a provenance of a single reel-to-reel tape loop, coalescing over an extended runtime via generative software processing. Ameliorator was conceived and built during a time of forced inactivity, while recovering from an intensely painful tendon injury that prevented me from easily standing or walking. It is intended to be both therapeutic sound and an aural representation of the process of healing. My inability to move very easily inspired me to create something very quiet, focused on the present moment, and filling that moment with a calm stillness.

            "about": "Kazuya Ishigami, a sound designer from Osaka, Japan, makes his debut at P / Psi / P with ARCHIVE DELETER, a three-part album of isolationist drone and formless void. Metallic tones with a reflective surface unspool glacially from an unreachable horizon. In one moment it feels meditative, and in the next, filled with a cosmic dread. Digging deeper, one could relate some of the sounds to distant machinery, piping off steam through bulbous steel veins, boring through alien black stone in an irradiated quarry, on some forsaken outer planetoid. ARCHIVE DELETER is perhaps one of the darkest releases in the Psoma catalog thus far, recalling only the ten ultra-minimalist recordings of : and Brian Grainger's nineteen-disc Cursive Bell album, but even among those things it feels singular and difficult to classify.\nKazuya Ishigami also runs the Neus-318 label:  neus318.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "In January of 2018, Beno√Æt Poussin debuted Autres Mesures, an original drone composition that was conceived and performed on the organ inside the Saint-Germain church, in Rennes, France. The organ itself was built in the nineteenth century, and the church it resides in goes as far back as the fifteenth century. Named after the music festival that the piece was imagined for, Autres Mesures exists in two different worlds: the mundane (exploring the voice of an instrument from the Old World, in the spaces of a structure that is even older) and the divine (the actuality of the sound, what it does between the vibration and the emotional/physical responses of the listeners), and the recording presented here dutifully conveys both of these perspectives, and others still.\nInterestingly, the church contains a 1664 painting of the resurrection of Lazarus by Gaspard de Crayer, further bringing to mind a sense of appreciation for the ability to draw breath, mindful of each conscious moment, while the euphoric sensations provided by the organ's monolithic exhalation underscore a feeling of rebirth, renewal, resetting and reorienting. With Autres Mesures, Poussin has conceived a fanfare for the self-realization that comes with lucid awareness - an understated but bold celebration of the \"now\" that is often times imperceptible within the confines of the body, and the all-too-bombarded sensory experiences we come to expect in day to day life.\nSonically, Autres Mesures is similar to recordings by pioneers like Eliane Radigue and Charlemagne Palestine, as well as modern artists like Eleh and Richard Chartier. It hovers in the air, perhaps liminally, never quite ascending into the clouds, but never touching down on land either. Within the warm pool of the organ's sustained tones is an immense chordal structure, the individual notes within it shimmering and bowing like the vocal cords of singers in a choir would. This creates the illusion of movement where there is none, with ephemeral shapes forming in the fog that the organ is breathing out into the vessel of the church.\nFor listeners present during the performance, as well as the performer himself, this created a physical sense of being truly inside the sound, essentially converting the church itself into a habitable speaker box. Poussin provided additional guidance for the audience, placing selected quotes at different locations within the church, themselves picked for their placement within the organ's reverberations. Reinforcing the sensation of subtle shapes accumulating and dissolving within the sound were low-light setups that varied extremely slowly. In such a time and space, what the body perceives as vibration and what the mind perceives in the lack of well-lit visual stimuli, it becomes possible to consciously enter a gnostic state, suspending the listener's awareness of time passing.\nTo reproduce this experience as accurately as possible, great care was taken during the night between August 6-7th of 2018, with sound engineer Simon Oriot, to record Autres Mesures without the interference of an audience or external noises like cars and passers by. Poussin and Oriot placed a single dual-microphone in what they considered to be the most ideal spot to absorb the organ's output, while Poussin used strategically placed matchsticks to hold down the keys on the organ, so he could have both hands available to modulate and affect the organ's voicing with the drawbars. Two prior recordings were made of Autres Mesures - one a rehearsal, and the other a recording of the actual live performance, but at the request of the artist, only the formalized recording presented here is to be made available publicly.\nFor supporters of the physical edition of Autres Mesures, a download code will be sent in the mail, which provides private digital access to three additional versions of the piece: the rehearsal, the live performance and a \"reprocess\" mix that combines all three, assembled and produced by Brian Grainger. When paired with the CD-R recording, this amounts of over four hours of music, and a truly immersive experience in deep listening.",

It collects two high-resolution field recordings of Bethungra Dam in New South Wales, Australia from Burraston, and a drone recording titled \"Sustain\" from Grainger, built from a process involving different samplers arranging and processing coiled spring resonations, inspired in part by Burraston's long-running Rainwire installation project.\nAll three pieces are being offered in an attempt to raise money for the NSW Rural Fire Service, a volunteer organization that is working on the front lines of the bushfire crisis in Australia which has already claimed immense losses. Obviously, the more you can pay for Ps√∏ma 18, the more directly helpful our release will become, and your support is beyond appreciated. 100% of the money this release makes goes to NSW RFS.\nFOR MORE INFO ON HOW TO DONATE DIRECTLY TO NSW RFS:  www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/about-us/fundraising\nDGR-ENDORSED, REGISTERED CHARITIES WITH BUSHFIRE RELIEF AND RECOVERY ACTIVITIES [national list, this includes animal help and rural fire services]:  www.pmc.gov.au/registered-bushfire-charities\nThe Ecological Society of Australia [also DGR registered] has announced an Ecosystem Recovery Fund:  www.ecolsoc.org.au/news/2020/01/esa-bushfire-response",

            "about": "Peter Maximowitsch offers up a tantalizing selection of what he's described to us as \"stochastic electronic music\", designed through complex systems involving modular synthesis, software processing, human speech, a broken cassette recorder, outboard FX and Csound code programming. Somewhere in the chaos of physical and virtual signal routing, new and fascinating shapes can be observed and recorded, and the fruits of this work bear the name \"Brothers and Sisters.\"\nSonically, it brings to mind many different things - Oval's earlier glitch experiments, Richard D James' spectral mindfucks, Richard Chartier's inimitable work with high frequencies and our very own David Burraston's FM synthesizer homeopathy. Chunks of speech fizz and garble unintelligibly, reminding us that vocal communication is nothing more than acoustic data transference between two receivers. Occasional melodies and rhythmic sentences emerge, only to be blasted apart again by some incoming system reorganizer. Maximowitsch stresses the importance of listening to his recordings at high volumes, and especially on speakers that have a wide range of high and low frequency output.\nBrothers and Sisters leaves you with a feeling that could be described as something between being a foreigner and overhearing discussion in a language you do not understand, and having a psychedelic experience, hearing the voice of God. The profundity of these moments still somehow becomes apparent, and undeniable, despite being ciphered and obscured via Maximowitsch's detailed workflows, perhaps even reflecting on a deeper level that distant reminder of human touch present in even the most graduated generative systems.",
            "credits": "released April 5, 2020\nW/P by Peter Maximowitsch. Some of the compositions (mainly the Sisters) are based on recordings from 2016/2017 of voices on a broken tape recorder (Technics RS-M 63) and analogue modular synthesizer (MFB, Erica Synths) and feedback systems (Behringer MX1604A, Jomox T-Resonator, Ibanez MS10 and SM7, BOSS DD-7). The recordings were processed in Csound in summer 2019. Others were created using Ableton's Operator and Csound. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. Text and design by ABM&D.

The duo of Sound_00 + Lefterna are Toni Dimitrov & Boban Ristevski who hail from Macedonia, and seem to create all shades of drone synthesis and experimentalism together. The four recordings offered here are dark and ever-shifting in scope, and would appeal to listeners who enjoyed prior catalog releases by Blaubac and Douglas J. Needles.\nPrior release details:\n1. Collab 32 ( Previously released by Arsenic Solaris )\n2. Collab 39 ( Previously released by Warm Milk Recordings )\n3. Collab 41 ( Previously released by The Sketchbook Sounds )\n4.

            "about": "...and in the blink of an eye, Ourson arrives at Ps√∏ma Psi Phi.\nOurson, known to the government as Luke Hazard, has been a close friend, influence, label resource and collaborator going back to 2003-2004, when he was still calling himself Plantre, and I only had a single Milieu album under my belt. Hard to imagine a time when none of these hundreds of records existed, no?\nBut that's just it...Luke is a master of imagining and time, and his work exemplifies some of the purest and most vivid electronic music laid to tape. He inaugurated the INSTALL label in 2007 with his psychedelic mountain Eth, conjured one of the most beautiful ambient albums of all-time with Warming Plant and even drafted not one but two improvised collaborations with me, which today are not named in the public record.\nFinally, inevitably, we are here now - mostly in the here, sometimes in the now - and Luke's offered up a disarming collection of 47 tracks, the third volume of his Collected Natures series of spare and personal field recordings. Gone are the synthesizers, tape machines, FX labyrinths and epic compositions...we are left inside what Luke has labeled as \"personal spaces\", aural Polaroids that give us only a slight bit of context with a title like \"Quiet Window\" or \"Roaring Lake\", and with no effort or exposition, we're off and away...standing on a porch somewhere while the rain dribbles down around us, or laid upon the green grass of an open field scored by birdsong, as the warm sun beams on our cheeks.\nWhen I started INSTALL with David Tagg back in '07, we held a belief, maybe it was even just a method of working, and it stated that absolutely anything observable in the world, no matter how mundane, could have a line drawn around it and called art. Frames and crops are compositions in and of themselves, decisions made by a creative mind that wills into existence contexts and commentaries. Luke has done this here, with his field recording work, giving us a window into a moment that is otherwise his alone. These specific mixtures of wind, trees, outdoor reverberation and everything else were and are completely unique to there and then, and Luke has played the part of a curator, sifting through the mundane and the divine, and laying them all out on a table in front of us with no indicators for which is which.\nOn a more topical level, listening to field recordings has been a long-time fascination of mine, an exercise in escapism and an impetus for lucid dreaming. Records like Irv Teibel's fundamental Environments series, Kiyoshi Mizutani's Scenery Of The Border and Dan Crall's North all had profound effects on me, and have led me down a path that is littered with documents of the natural world, ripe with what David Tagg might call \"dream compost.\" So, although Luke has framed the windows and I'm holding open the door for you, it is fully up to you to decide the value of what you have found here. Perhaps, instead of speaking or walking or thinking, you might just close your eyes, take a deep breath...and listen.\nNOTE: The 47 files presented here constitute a triple album set, with marked divisions. #1-18 is the first disc, titled \"Home\", #19-35 is the second disc, titled \"Away\" and #36-47 is the third disc, titled \"Night.\" As a special addition, the physical edition of Collected Natures III is prefaced with Collected Natures I and II as well, making it a 5xCD-R set - the complete series up to this point. 5 hours, 51 minutes and 47 seconds of audio. All physical purchases of this set also come with Bandcamp download codes for Collected Natures I & II, courtesy of the artist.",

            "about": "The first solo LSZ recording to be issued at Psoma Psi Phi, following two charity splits with Dave Burraston, is the sparse Compound Displacement - an experimental vessel generated with a Zoom H1, Soma Ether v2 \"Anti Radio\" and a piezoelectric microphone, using captured spatial, vibrational and electrical events in transit between Centerville and Franklin, Ohio in August of 2020. This recording could be interpreted as a dub album without any of the musicians playing, only the traces and invisible contours of their presence remaining in this surrealistic nearly still-life. The development of this piece was influenced by Richard Chartier, Francisco Lopez and France Jobin first and foremost, and secondarily, Stockhausen and Xenakis cast their own shadows over the process. This work is an accumulation of sonic detritus that would otherwise be excised, filtered and edited out of a more conventional recording, and attempts to highlight this sound-matter from a new perspective, allowing it to exist as its own microverse of movement and shadow, a new music that is bereft of any philosophical purpose beyond that which the listener inscribes upon it.\nFor more LSZ and/or Limestone Ziggurat by any other name, please visit  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "\"The transcendental object is matter that behaves like thought and it is a doorway into the imagination. This is where we're all going to live.\" - Terrence McKenna\nAdrien75, a longtime friend and influence, broadcasts his first full-length at Ps√∏ma from his home studio in Oregon - an hour of deep listening and guitar improvisation titled Contemplating The Transcendental Object. The album consists of six live takes using electric guitar and a small array of effects devices, and explores tonal hills and bends with foggy, half-recollected curvatures of glissando and lethargic strums. Landscapes of green forestry coated in golden sun beam outward from the wow and flutter of Adrien's instrument, before being momentarily retracted and replaced with storm clouds, hints of warm rain, overcast humidities. Transcendental Object plays out in a similar way as classic loop-centric ambient works by Fripp & Eno or Stars of the Lid, although Adrien's inimitable fingerprint as a guitarist draws a line through these things and places us in an atmosphere entirely new, save for perhaps small islands of memory, reference points to Adrien's earlier guitar paintings on Coastal Acces, itself being a full eighteen years ago now. Adrien's work continues to hum and crackle with life and movement that other guitarists may have overlooked or bypassed, and we are all the happier to act as a vessel for these evocative performances.",

            "about": "Dense plumes of smoke slowly form an upward wall from some unfathomably deep abyssal opening beneath us. Shades of not just grey, but violet and port-wine burgundy, subtly backlit by slow flashes of silver light, exploding suns, holes in dimensional fabric, or even sparks from some infernal foundry, sunken like an iron tomb in the belly of Hell. These curious shapes and distant spasms of backlit depth, themselves seemingly sentient and alluring, indicate above all else a sensation of immense distance, time and space being traversed in a black and irradiated shortcut, a utility tunnel between the planes. We can only presume that, despite such distances being bridged in some non-Euclidean way, the reverberations we hear are indicators that this distance nonetheless exists. As this smoke-thing that seems to be much more than smoke now enters our lungs and singes our squinting eyes, we're more deeply aware of a communion taking place, minds chained together instead of hands, slack-jaws murmuring drones in some sinful unison instead of recognizable language. Curvatures of planets we've never seen convey themselves first as horizon lines, dipped in alien twin-sunsets, before exploding in silent majesty like unfurling fractals in every color. Gigantic gravities suck us downward into a warmth that goes backward in time, some great returning to the womb calling us home, those intermittent cracks of light in the haze getting closer, wider, more familiar. Our minds as we knew them are now themselves memories and fragments of memories, artifacts from a different time, now merely spattered paint on an impossibly black firmament that swallows everything up not out of hunger or sustenance, but in becoming everything.",

            "about": "Expanding on/subtracting from an approach that previously yielded an eight-hour generative ambient piece (issued under the Milieu moniker - see:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/living-in-the-shadow-of-a-recursive-bell-whose-chime-echoed-the-dawn-of-consciousness  ), Cursive Bell is a nineteen-volume set of drone reductions and distillations, designed for low-level playback in indoor/outdoor settings. Ideal for a sleep assistant or an unobtrusive tone coloring for creative and work spaces, Cursive Bell originated on analog and digital synthesizers, modular feedback and medical tone generators, before being processed extensively via FFT transforms, low resolution downsampling and copious blending with reverbs and delays. It builds upon my previous ethos in the Workingman's Drone series - minimalist sonic escapism, produced by and for the common (hu)man. Fantasy as utility, work as art, volume as philosophy and time itself as an effects processor.\nIn keeping with this perspective, Cursive Bell has been designed as a budget release from the ground up. Nineteen printed discs are housed within ink-stamped white paper sleeves, bookended by two pieces of hand-cut basswood bearing ink stamping, held together with two heavy duty rubber bands. 23 hours, 5 minutes and 13 seconds of physical and digital audio.",

            "about": "Rik Johnson is a guitarist residing in the snow-covered mountains of northern Colorado, and his first full-length offering to Ps√∏ma is the beautiful Deep Bed. Five intimate playthroughs of Rik's slight of hand with electric guitar as the sole voice, Deep Bed bridges the deeper, drone-focused side of Rik's work with the more melodic aspects of it, bringing to mind respectful comparisons to Roy Montgomery, David Tagg, Manual and Aidan Baker. Deep Bed is a gorgeous release, embodying the equivalent of a pretty garden of colorful flowers set deep inside a whitened valley of empty noise, and carries a sense of melancholic longing throughout, a feeling of looking across a distance at something that brings back a memory of missing someone. Well-adapted music for reading, meditating, sleeping or stargazing, and a welcome balm for the present moment.",

            "about": "'Diminishment' is one of several extended sessions recorded throughout 2022-2023 that focus upon bass frequencies and deriving unique textural output from the application of various saturations of gain. 'Diminishment' was initially recorded in 2022 as a simple sub-bass session built by recording ground hum, and subsequently processing it through a resonant low-pass analog filter. This recording was then further mutated by multiple granular processors, using fast Fourier transforms to elongate it, before being split into two mono sides and rerouted through a vintage Yamaha MA-10 amplifier from 1981, and reassembled into the stereo recording presented here.\nMusically, 'Diminishment' is best experienced on closed-ear headphones or open-air speaker systems with an emphasis on considerable bass frequency output capabilities. Maximum volume yields maximum results.",

            "about": "The second installment of OCR recordings, which exist as \"possible worlds\" in timelines adjacent to ours, where their analogs are Occur releases, issued at Recycled Plastics. This volume, known as Doe, is an ambient configuration of the Occur EP Dropper, and is built using only the original session recordings for Dropper.\nUnlike M before it, Doe glows with a sunny pastoral shimmer, where perhaps the fallout of future has given way to a blooming, wild paradise of flowers and coppice. Spring eternal bursts forth from the coal-black death of the past, and life is triumphant once again. Majestic blue skies sit watchfully over this garden of re-creation, a once sleeping and pregnant mother heralding warmth and wealth anew. These bounding hills and dales are hers, and those people waking up on the horizon line - those are hers, too.",

            "about": "Psoma Psi Phi has the honor and the pleasure of formally/physically introducing the extensive and expansive recording work of Yorkshire Modular Society to the world, in a five-disc box set canvassing ten different longform drone works from the first year of the project's sessions. YMS is a secondary moniker of Dom Schofield, elsewhere known as Oxynucid within the braindance, techno and acid circles he travels in, and represents (as the name would imply) his explorations with an ever-evolving and expanding modular synthesizer he has built.\nSonically, these drones recall some of the most evocative and essential drone recordings of decades past, from Eliane Radigue's Adnos to Alvin Lucier's Music On A Long Thin Wire, as well as fitting contemporaneously and comfortably alongside modern pioneers like David Burraston, Eleh and Richard Chartier. Further still, seasoned drone listeners will connect the humming vibrance of Yorkshire Modular Society's studies to elements of work by Yoshi Wada, La Monte Young and Folke Rabe. For us here at Psoma, these recordings are destined to become just as perennial as the aforementioned, vividly elemental yet temperature-universal recordings that can be installed as a utility for therapy, sleep, meditation or simply an alternative to a \"too quiet\" environment. They are able to impart impressive low-frequency output at higher volume levels, and they are able to remain as discreet as a whisper at lower volumes - much like our recent five-part Noyzelab series of Cell Meditations, these are flexible audio tools that yield many possible presentations and experiences to many different types of listening.\nA second archive of five more discs is forthcoming, and we would also like to suggest that the public look into YMS on Bandcamp, which offers a subscription that yields regular installments of synthesized excursions:  yorkshiremodularsociety.bandcamp.com  . We raise our glass to Dom and his pulsating ever-growing modular system that broadcasts from Yorkshire, long may they generate the frequencies that massage our brains into contented submission.",

            "about": "David Burraston returns for his third release at P / Psi / P, the mindmelting 4-hour DSP TRX. His second 4xCD-R set in our catalog, after the equally monolithic PPLZ SYNF.\nDSP TRX is sometimes manic, turning itself into shapes that seem impossible or unfathomable, and at other times it becomes more stable, barely moving like a deep pool beneath an occasional wind gust. As is Burraston's custom, DSP TRX delivers its most potent and stimulating moments after the sounds themselves have sustained long enough to remove your awareness of time as a reference point. Not quite drone, not only synthesizer music, but wholly a displacing other. The shuddering tone fields stretch out for miles, expanding forever, and then contract again into more observable sections, like a muscle. We're never certain if we're hearing feedback with mathematically-divided holes poked in it, or a radio custom-built by Burraston that tunes into millions of digital bubbles, following traced lines toward a central frequency of his own devising. DSP TRX is both bright and dark, a dramatic rapid tremolo of silence and noise, infinitely revolving, inverting and slowing down - or is it speeding up? Once again, Burraston delivers proof that he is not operating on our plane of reality, or the neighboring ones, but above them all, in an undefined place outside time, space and everything in between.\nDSP TRX is available as an edited digital edition (2 tracks) or as a full four-disc/16 track excursion. An unabridged digital release will follow later at Boomkat.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "For his 11th cataloged release at Psoma Psi Phi, David Burraston offers the NYZ album DTRM. First in a series of in-depth studies of the classic diode transformer ring modulator. Recordings detail a number of circuits all built by hand at Noyzelab by Dave Burraston. Circuit construction used a combination of soldering of diode rings and crocodile clipping up various transformer configurations. The DTRM is likely the cheapest and simplest of all synth DIY circuits, and the configuration spaces of component possibilities is vast.\nSonically, DTRM is a mass of drones, shuddering in and out of focus, a smooth stone wall covered in sand and strange colors of moss that don't seem terrestrial. The more you observe it, the more intensely it vibrates, surrounding you, resisting definition but demanding observation. Similar in tonal personality to the PPLZ SYNF recordings, but warmer and denser.\nEQUIPMENT LIST:\nXicon 42TM018 10kohm centre tapped transformer x2\nJaycar MM2534 3kohm centre tapped transformer x2\nMaplin VTX-101-007 600ohm centre tapped transformer x2\nBAT46 Schottky Diode x4 configured in a ring\nLED assorted colours x4 configured in a ring\nALM Akemie's Castle\nIntellijel Cylonix Cyclebox II\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

            "about": "Following 2020's DTRM, the 11th release in the Noyzelab catalog at Psoma, is the second volume of recordings focusing on the classic diode transformer ring modulator. Informed by hand-built circuits of Burraston's own construction, which utilized a combination of soldered diode rings and crocodile-clipping together various different transformer configurations, DTRM2 is a buzzing swarm of drone structures that not only recall the previous volume, but aspects of the PPLZ SYNF 4xCD album as well. \"The DTRM is likely the cheapest and simplest of all synth DIY circuits, and the configuration space of component possibilities is vast.\" said Burraston at press time, from somewhere beneath a massive nest of wires.\nThe sessions presented here were undertaken in January 2018, exploring a setup consisting of an Altronics M0709 600 ohm / 600 ohm bridging input transformer (notably a different transformer from the one used in the first DTRM recordings), four LEDs in assorted colours configured in a ring and ALM's ever-reliable Akemie's Castle, which has been used on prior Noyzelab catalog entries. DTRM2 manifested in the form of four 'brain eraser' meditations (see: Cell Meditations in five color-coded volumes) that precede a forty-minute mass to fully disconnect within.\nAs it has often been written with regard to Burraston's music, NYZ recordings offer the listener engagement at many different levels, both conscious and subconscious. At the surface, these are shimmering drone walls, humming with electric life and endless oscillation, but beneath that surface exists a carefully constructed world of numerical and philosophical relationships, almost entirely detached in their function from the concept of this music. Further down still are the tools themselves, often times seen as more mundane circuits and parts of equipment that Burraston manages to wire together and chart a navigational path to something divine with, the very definition of transcendence from the mechanical to the majestic.\nThrough this shared act of listening, we enter into a synergistic state, a bubble in a spirit level that remains absolutely still, and it is our hope at Psoma that these recordings may be used as a utility not unlike those of an architect, seeking to find the balance in this house we are always building for ourselves.\n---\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs).

            "about": "David Burraston returns to Psoma Psi Phi with his fourth release for the label, and second bearing the Noyzelab moniker. Earth Cell Meditations is the first of a five-part series that will be issued serially across the next five months. The recordings presented here are, as the title implies, intended to assist in meditation, and operate as minimalistic walls of humming drones, parsed out into pre-determined \"dosages\", to assist in their usage as a utility. Only have three minutes before you have to go to work? There's a 3-minute Earth Cell Meditation for you here. Need a harmonic backdrop for your yoga session or your power nap? Earth Cell also comes in 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30-minute sections. For those of you seeking a deeper experience, Burraston has also provided 45 and 60-minute versions of these Meditations, perfect for disconnection, introspection and all manner of subconscious stimulation. As is his usual, Burraston's work treats time itself as an elastic band that passes by at a rate of his choosing, and for this we've come to be quite addicted to these recordings, even finding ourselves lost inside a three-minute drone. In this fashion, Noyzelab has essentially created an infinite generative structure, and these segments are in fact windows of varying lengths of time, through which we're able to observe and experience something that is impossibly large and unfathomably deep. Be careful with these Meditations - even the artist himself has issued a text advisory in the notes for these recordings - for they are potent and finely distilled examples of the current the universe itself moves through, from element to element.\nNOTE: The digital version of NYZ-IV contains only the 20-minute Meditation. For the full and unabridged Earth Cell Meditations experience, listeners may purchase the limited edition 3xCD-R set.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "With his sophomore contribution to the Psoma catalog, Giulio Fontana returns with another 28 minutes of no-input feedback music. This time, the namesake machine used for Filterbank Feedback Works is the Sherman Filterbank 2, a racked analog filter bank produced since 1996 in Belgium. Using the Sherman unit, Fontana coaxes out lively forms that pulse and bubble with audible sinew, and everything feels distinctly wetter and more fluid than his previous Psoma release Omega. For our ears, it sounds like a vibrant cross-pollination of Stephen P. McGreevy's magnetosphere recordings, Mika Vainio's lab-grown minimalism as Philus and Aube's water-oriented recordings, with the timbral character of Fontana's work mutating between test equipment tone bursts, alien field recordings and perhaps the close-mic'd sound of some type of hydroelectric drainage equipment. Betrayed by its modest runtime, one might swear that the scale of Filterbank Feedback Works is much larger than it appears, with a landscape of sound that bristles and confounds, yielding new shapes and dimensions in subsequent listens.",

            "about": "David Burraston returns to Psoma Psi Phi with his sixth release for the label, and fourth bearing the Noyzelab moniker. Fire Cell Meditations is the third of a five-part series that will be issued serially between October 2018 and February 2019.\nThe recordings presented here are, as the title implies, intended to assist in meditation, and operate as minimalistic walls of humming drones, parsed out into pre-determined \"dosages\", to assist in their usage as a utility. Only have three minutes before you have to go to work? There's a 3-minute Cell Meditation for you here. Need a harmonic backdrop for your yoga session or your power nap? Cell Meditations also come in 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30-minute sections. For those of you seeking a deeper experience, Burraston has also provided 45 and 60-minute versions of these Meditations, perfect for disconnection, introspection and all manner of subconscious stimulation. As is his usual, Burraston's work treats time itself as an elastic band that passes by at a rate of his choosing, and for this we've come to be quite addicted to these recordings, even finding ourselves lost inside a three-minute drone. In this fashion, Noyzelab has essentially created an infinite generative structure, and these segments are in fact windows of varying lengths of time, through which we're able to observe and experience something that is impossibly large and unfathomably deep. Be careful with these Meditations - even the artist himself has issued a text advisory in the notes for these recordings - for they are potent and finely distilled examples of the current the universe itself moves through, from element to element.\nNOTE: The digital version of NYZ-VI contains only the 20-minute Meditation. For the full and unabridged Fire Cell Meditations experience, listeners may purchase the limited edition 3xCD-R set.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "A flickering light in a smoky room, erratically glowing and fading on a dust-covered console. Readouts in lines and smaller lights convey a silent ramble, the only acknowledgement a small whirr far beneath the control top, a logic gate clicking into place and closing. At this, a careful hand reaches out and adjusts a dial, and almost immediately a cascade of wavering pulses ripples through the smoky haze like a pebble in a pond. An inhalation, a pause, a consideration and then a lateral movement, a slight nudge in another direction - not backwards, or forwards, but sideways. The sound slips and skips and catches itself just barely before tumbling over the edge of some perceived chasm, now reprogrammed and free of fear, built to float instead of fall, an efficient system defined by predeterminations. Dozing eyes peer down on the landscape of writhing oscillators, shuddering operators and hyperventilating amplifiers, like a mythic God raising an eyebrow at the curious dances of pagans, the selflessness of machines, only ever aching for the hands and whims of their makers, now subverted with will and not knowing what to do with themselves.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

            "about": "For the occasion of Juneteenth, now well on its way to becoming rightfully declared a national holiday in the US, David Burraston and Brian Grainger unite for their third charity split, the accessibly-titled FM40P::M46tORG_blym_zero / Autofugue Via Four Operators & Multitrack Tape. The split collects two surrealistic ambient pieces primarily created using the Yamaha TX81Z four-operator FM synthesizer, with the first being taken from the same session that yielded NYZ's FM40P album from earlier in the year, and the second being Brian's second-ever publicly issued recording under his recently unveiled Limestone Ziggurat moniker. It is the sincere hope of the two sound recordists that this music exists as a balm of comfort for escaping from a world that is far too miserable for far too many people. Bandcamp themselves are donating 100% of their revenue shares on Juneteenth to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and we're backing this effort by donating all money generated from this split to the same organization.\nLearn more about Juneteenth here:  daily.bandcamp.com/features/juneteenth-fundraiser-2021\nNAACP LDF:  www.naacpldf.org\nNOTE: No physical editions of Psoma 39 will be offered.",

            "about": "Following on the mind-melting FM40P, David Burraston returns to Psoma Psi Phi with FM40P mkII, another unique session exploring four-operator FM synthesis by way of Burraston's own curious methodologies.\nTwo extended runtime tracks make up a full hour of immersive listening, with \"honka_#1a\" feeling like a completely synthetic free jazz session, or perhaps a computer brain thinking about what \"jazz\" might sound like based solely upon a series of text-based inputs. There's still an oddly human sense in the note fingerings and sections where some notes extensively sustain and others blip once before disappearing into the fray, an implication of fluidity without latency or hesitation giving way to clusters of ideas overlapping with each other in a stack of musical Venn diagrams.\nThe twice as long \"DRN1\" piece presents the four-operator designs in a completely different light, simultaneously more angular and also more inert, with metallic, pipe-like overtones struggling to return to the surface and almost always being pulled away from their resolutions and displaced into some other shape beneath folded sawtoothy waves. Across the forty-minute piece, more and more stasis occurs, a paralysis of more and more held notes, gradually accumulating in a whorl of wavering shimmer.\nAnother intrepid and stimulating sensory experience being added to an already large catalog of rich sonic material, FM40P mkII continues to illustrate with inimitable immediacy and masterful restraint just how deep the well goes within the machines whose time has come and gone in the eyes and ears of the general public. Burraston may want us to consider the very real possibility that new tools are not quite as necessary as they seem, or further, that they should first be used to maintain and redefine the tools and systems of the past.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs).

            "about": "In a third volume of his ongoing FM40P series of recordings, Dave Burraston continues to explore a myriad of tangents and timbres within the Yamaha V50, TX81Z and FB-01 machines - all of them uniquely apart from one another, their commonality being their identities as four-operator digital FM synthesizers. FM synthesis is well known for both its ability to convey otherwise impossible sounds and its general unapproachability as pure programming and sound design. Through this lens of context, Burraston's ability to direct these machines towards unforeseen and inexplicable pathways says much about the rarity of recordings like these. On a deeper level, Burraston is perhaps always testing, measuring, adjusting and analyzing, interacting with synthesis and its many vessels. Acting with the interests of both musician and scientist, NYZ brings us always to fresh perspectives and sonic locations that feel as if they are entirely new, often alien, but never predictable or repetitive. It's a lot to consider, as music and also as concept, but at the end of the day, you can always count on NYZ recordings for their utterly uncompromising sense of displacement and dizzying enchantment.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

            "about": "Appropriately, FM60P is the sixth NYZ release to focus directly on FM synthesis, and the first six-operator variant of the FMX0P releases (which was incidentally also the first conceptual iteration of the sub-series of FM synth works, despite being released this far down the line). Given this provenance, those familiar with FM synthesis might assume Burraston would begin a six-operator exploration with the ubiquitous Yamaha DX7 - perhaps the most iconic FM synthesizer of all time - but instead, he's taken a different tack entirely, and opted to use a modern machine - the Kodamo EssenceFM, a megalith of FM processing power with a mind-numbing 300 operators available within its outwardly unassuming racked interface - albeit acting in an ascetic sense by limiting himself deliberately to only six operators. Longtime Psoma listeners will also note a referential connection with PMFM, a prior release that also utilized the EssenceFM in its construction.\nOn a technical level, FM60P manifests itself through the arcane pathways of Burraston's cellular automata research, which informs both the sequencing information sent into the synthesizer, and the microtuning of the voices also. Beyond this initial working ethos, the designs and numerical relationships of the operators' ratios have been arranged with the use of three different sets of Fibonacci number sequences, as well as tuning dispositions referencing Alain Dani√©lou's Harmonic Division of the Octave. Fibonacci freaks will be pleased to know that this arrangement of operators will form intricate setups of Golden Ratio based¬†FM¬†timbres.\nFor many listening and reading, these points of reference may have no meaning whatsoever, and we here at Psoma would like to offer the consolation that there is no right or wrong way to listen to or interact with any sound matter found in our catalog, or anywhere else for that matter. It could even be said that part of our initiative in publishing works such as these is defined by a desire to simply introduce more challenging and concept-driven music into the world, in order to bring new and stimulating experiences to people who are both familiar and unfamiliar with the deeper details of sound itself.\nSo what does that leave us with then? The sound of FM60P could be described as a chiming din of glassy tones playing in serpentine unison with sub-bass hum - but this is only a small prologue of two minutes, quickly pulling back the curtain to reveal a massive hour-long drone wall, presented in Burraston's characteristic style of rippling heavily modulated swaths of energy, underpinned by a more midrange foundation of a pulsing alien plinth. Filter sweeps reveal many more dimensions to the layers that are not initially obvious, bringing incessant bass tones and arpeggiator-like sections into focus before the wavering sea reclaims them.\nBurraston's music is unlike anything else in the space it is able to inhabit, simultaneously sounding artificial and unnatural to an almost impossible degree, while also functionally conveying itself in elemental and naturalistic ways. Everything is an object, an outline, a weather system or a color, each possessing a specific set of attributes that communicate synaesthetically with the listener, as temperatures and spatial indicators, rather than confining themselves to much more arbitrary traditional sensations.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

            "about": "FM80P is, as the title may imply, the sound of NYZ exploring FM synthesis via the voice of a Yamaha FS1R FM synthesizer and the MANIAC cellular automata sequencer. Burraston has had a long history with FM synthesis and FM80P feels very much in line with the ethos of the Cell Meditations recordings, using different frequencies for therapeutic purposes, albeit from a completely different perspective. Where other NYZ recordings can sometimes remain in stasis, surrounding the listener with a vibrational stillness, FM80P is a more active recording, dappling the stereo field with overlapping tones in all octaves, scanning for tensions to release and filling mental gaps with liquified drops of sunshine. It reminds us of a number of \"ear floss\" recordings that we have considered classics and utilized in medicinal capacities, such as Antti Rannisto's \"√Ñ√§niesineit√§\", Chartier's \"A Hesitant Fold\" and Vainio's \"Tetra\", and will easily remain in your sonic medicine cabinet for years to come.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Jonathan Deasy hails from Ireland, and has issued recordings under his birthname and his Quiet Clapping moniker, in addition to being 1/2 of the editing committee for the Strukturriss literary journal. Formant consists of two extended beatless pieces, his first recordings for Psoma Psi Phi, although not his last, if we have anything to do with that. These two pieces swell and glow in their own radiant simplicities, content to be mostly stationary, but never so ambient that you let go of their traits entirely. Formant exemplifies much of what we love about drone music and sustained-tone sounds, and anyone following Psoma since the start of the label will understand just what that means, before even pressing play. For the uninitiated, this would very much appeal to fans of deep listening such as Eliane Radigue, Folke Rabe, or more modern names such as Eleh, Richard Chartier and Benoit Poussin. Quiet and warm synthesis that is at once easy to approach, and deep enough to get lost within. The perfect soundtrack for thawing out as Spring approaches.",

            "about": "Nicholas Maloney hails from Jackson, MS, and offers a monolithic label debut to Ps√∏ma with FORMS WITHIN SPACES. It consists of five pieces that explore resonances within a variety of interior spaces through the process of recording room tones, various objects, and instruments, then amplifying and re-recording the sound back into the room thus capturing the unique sonic characteristics of these areas.\nFORMS WITHIN SPACES is quiet music, functionally speaking, and will work wonderfully when used as a sleep aid, a meditation or simply some tonal coloring for your room while you read books or relax. It would easily appeal to fans of the lowercase sound designs of Richard Chartier, Francisco Lopez and France Jobin, but listeners who enjoy synthesizer drones from Eliane Radigue would also find a lot to love here. Maloney's interesting experimentation with room resonance and selective feedback also brings to mind masters such as Alvin Lucier as well as contemporary minds like Yann Novak. FORMS WITHIN SPACES is not inaccessible, despite the long runtimes, and we encourage listeners to experiment with different methods of playback, at different decibel levels and also in and out of headphones.\n(More notes regarding each individual piece, direct from the artist, have been included in the track pages)",

The amplifier was placed directly under the metal causing additional feedback loops and tones. Again, this recording was played back into the room several times and re-recorded by way of the contact mics attached to the sheet metal.",

            "about": "It's been over a year since Psoma issued new work in David Burraston's open-ended NYZ subcatalog - a point we're looking to rectify with a crop of no less than three new releases.\nThe third of this new triad is GRFM, and we are off and rolling with yet another of NYZ‚Äôs favourite sub-obsessions - that of FM and the Golden Ratio. We don‚Äôt need to touch upon the background of the Golden Ratio here, suffice to say it has been influential in countless areas and NYZ has been interested in it for quite some time. Now, he has decided to start feeding your ears with his own take on this approach, consisting of some FM explorations - hence the appropriately titled GRFM.\nThis one pays homage to John Chowning [of course!] and utilises his 9 note Phi tuning. We are informed it‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen hooked up with FM algorithms using Fibonacci Sequence numbers for it‚Äôs ratios.‚Äù As ever, NYZ reminds us through this long form drone that his exploratory sound worlds really do extend in all directions.. as he informed us on sending this one in : ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs designed to subconsciously interweave itself into the very fabric of your being.‚Äù And we heartily agree!\n---\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Mosca is an old friend and talented synthesist from Scotland, whose name is much more recognizable for acid and techno pursuits. However, for High Rise, his first release under the Mosca name in ten years, he arrives with an hour of beatless and pure analog synthesizer drone music. Subtitled \"Music Inspired By The 1975 Novel By J.G. Ballard\", the contexts and reference points these recordings make are immediate and obvious - Ballard's novel being one both dark and violent, but also deeply analytical of the modern world, of technology (and the apathy that often follows its conveniences) and of the corporate vision for humanity. Mosca uses these themes as a sharp edge to drive his intense analog sweeps forward, evoking all manner of emotional disconnection and social decay in their wavering and lonesome monophonic voices. High Rise is the pulse, the stripped-bare heart beating inside cold stone and metal structures, and combines the often clinically sterile landscape of synthesizer music and hardware fetishism with the desperation and critical world-view of Ballard's enduring ethos, elevating these recordings to something not quite a score but more than unguided improvisations, something very \"other.\"",

            "about": "HYDR SYNF is a sixty-four minute drone monolith, coaxed out of the Ashun Sound Machines Hydrasynth - the newest smoke signal from Cootamundra, and the first Noyzelab recording at Psoma Psi Phi since the MYZTRYZ assemblage in May. Like many of Burraston's drone recordings, HYDR SYNF exists in a state of minimalism and maximalism simultaneously, allowing the listener to determine (by way of their volume dial) how much or how little of it to fill the room. HYDR SYNF, for its part in this relationship, works beautifully both ways, as a quiet intimate hum to dot the corners of the wall with, or as an immense structure that is dense enough to dissolve those walls, and replace your surroundings altogether. Noyzelab recordings are like no other, as many frequent listeners here will no doubt attest, in their ability to remove axiomatic information from the world they inhabit. There are no longer discernible directions in space or time, and after long enough of a sustained runtime, it becomes possible to dispense with space and time entirely.\nAs is our usual method, HYDR SYNF is offered here in an abridged digital format for free, and in an unabridged CD-R format for an affordable price. Listeners interested in unabridged digital formats should consider subscribing to Noyzelab's Bandcamp output here:  noyzelab.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "For the 26th release in the NYZ subcatalog, Psoma is pleased to offer the public HYDR SYNF2 - the second session of drone research using the extensive architecture of the Ashun Sound Machines Hydrasynth.\nBeing unable to praise this machine highly enough, Burraston has again absorbed himself fully in coaxing the pulsing sonic depths of the Hydrasynth to bring us this latest report. Feeling and following the pulse is a definitive aspect of this session, which is populated with a few foaming waves here and there, moving us around the map enough to see from different vantage points.\nHYDR SYNF2 continues the rich lineage of NYZ recordings at Psoma, and would easily appeal to fans of his prior drone-focused work with pointed soundwaves, such as the Cell Meditations, PMFM or PPLZ SYNF. As always, the digital release offered here is a FREE abridged version of the full 73-minute recording, which has been made available on the limited CD-R edition. Listeners who would like to acquire the full recording in a digital/streaming format are encouraged to visit Noyzelab's personal Bandcamp page and support his work there:  noyzelab.bandcamp.com\n---\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Yasuyuki Uesugi arrives at Psoma with a unique voice, rooted in analog synthesis, noise music and deeply layered self-analytics. I Don't Notice That I'm Losing My Place is possibly the noisiest album in the Psoma catalog thus far, and to overlook this fact about it would miss part of what makes the catalog entry interesting, and to focus upon it would render Uesugi's work in the genre moot upon arrival. What we hear when we press play is a swirling set of feedback paths, oscillators tangled up in knots and humming, droning machineries plodding their cyclical functions downward into a type of entropic runoff. Uesugi's recordings feel as if they are the sound we might hear in the vacuum of space, if instead of being a soundless void, it were a densely filled threshold of sonic matter, an aggregate of all the cosmic detritus and hurling planetoid masses, populating the blackness behind the stars like billions of inkblots. There is a freefall to this type of music, and we enjoy records like this more as experiences rather than traditional interactions with sound. They require a specific level of willingness to be tossed into the tumult, a type of faith and subservience that most other art forms do not ask of the consumer. Uesugi seems to know this, and embrace it to a devastating degree, much like his forebearers in the field, and while many will spend seconds with this album before deciding that it sounds like all other noise albums before it, a few of you may yet be patient enough to see that Uesugi's work is very unique to his ears, hands and mind, and that I Don't Notice That I'm Losing My Place is in fact an apt description of how these recordings can completely dissolve your sense of time and space.",

            "about": "In 2022 and 2023, LSZ published five digital releases with titles bearing segments of a poem, each containing a study of loop-based composition from a different perspective. These five pieces explore recursion through the lens of modular synthesis, approaching cyclical repetition as both a rigid windowed section of time, and as a representation of an oscillator with a novel waveform.\nAfter the fifth session was published, the decision was made to collect the entirety of the work into a self-contained box set edition, and to offer it here at Psoma Psi Phi in order to better distribute the work to receptive ears and minds. 'In Curvature' is a unique map marker in the wider landscape of my creative work, and this box set contains a printed sheet that compiles my notes written for each individual release, alongside black and white reproductions of each album's cover art.\nAll of the visuals for 'In Curvature' are carefully selected crops of larger images by Luigi Mayer from the early 1800s, whose work has been a synaesthetic influence on my own for many years now, even before I could consider myself a musician (and at forty years of age, with twenty-six of those years devoted to music, I still wonder whether or not I am qualified to call myself this).\n'In Curvature' offers all five pieces in this polyptych for a reduced combination price, although it is also possible to buy individual recordings for their original list price of $6.66 each. Curious listeners are encouraged to explore the wider LSZ/Limestone Ziggurat catalog at  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "For the first time on a physical format, Psoma Psi Phi offers up a complete collection of the first \"season\" of thirteen deep ambient Thalo Green recordings. These pieces were originally issued one at a time, the first being released in June 2019, and were published with zero biographical information or provenance. They were made available only as digital downloads at the Thalo Green Bandcamp page (  123524.bandcamp.com  ) and only now have been assembled into a definitive release. Preferring to show and not tell, Thalo Green seems to be a generative process that transfigures television broadcasts into lush ambient sound, and while we were able to make contact with the mind(s) behind Thalo Green (and its sister project, Thalo Blue) and officially license this edition, we have been asked to respect the agency of the artist and refrain from any further discussion about who they are, where they're from and why they've made these recordings.\nMusically, the Thalo Green recordings resemble a number of things that reside within the deep listening spectrum - sustained tone drone music, vague clouds of orchestral fog that bring to mind Wolfgang Voigt's Ruckverzauberung works and extremely focused minimalism that echoes meditative classics by Eliane Radigue, Pinkcourtesyphone or Harry Bertoia. These sounds are both able to dodge direct observation and command the removal of other distractions, and for this, we feel they are incredibly versatile in purpose, from sleep sound, to reading or bathing music, to meditative/yogic prompts and even as an atmospheric backdrop for creative work such as writing or painting. They are a direct contrast from the Thalo Blue recordings, which are not only more modest in their runtimes, but more aquatic and filled with subtle movements, whereas the Thalo Green recordings feel Earthen and forestial. These relationships could simply be the need of the human mind to arrange things and interpret them based on a minimum of external stimuli, in this case, a single shade of the color green, but one would not be faulted in thinking that these colors may have been chosen for their synaesthetic qualities just as much as their aesthetics. It is our sincere hope that Psoma's re-publishing of these recordings will bring them to a wider audience that we feel will truly benefit from their effects, both long and short term, and this hope is equaled by another, that the mind(s) behind Thalo Green and Thalo Blue will continue to record new music in the future.\nNOTE: Due to the considerable amount of audio contained in this release, Psoma Psi Phi has elected to issue the material on two DVD-R discs, which contain the original unaltered 16-bit 44100Hz WAV format audio files that were sent to us. We feel that this keeps the ritual of a physical edition intact and available, while also reducing unnecessary shipping bulk and material costs. All standard DVD players and computers should be able to play these discs, although for more practical/portable listening, users are encouraged to generate their own lossy file conversions.",

            "about": "Ps√∏ma Psi Phi introduces a new artist on √ò20 - Anna Generator - and her debut recording KVK. Live and entirely improvised using only a Korg analog polysynth, a Boss RV-3 delay unit and a Peavey mixing desk, KVK is a surreal landscape of playful synthesis that recalls early electronic music such as Wendy Carlos, Tzvi Avni, Alvin Lucier and others. Produced with a minimum of sequencing and a focus on pulling sinews of sound apart, accumulating them into gigantic whorls of sculpted mass. While experimental and untamed, it clocks in at a modest runtime of about 14 minutes, so Ps√∏ma has augmented this release with an extended reappraisal of KVK by label head Brian Grainger that explores the liminal spaces between KVK's steep collisions to a deep and hypnotic effect.",

            "about": "It's been over a year since Psoma issued new work in David Burraston's open-ended NYZ subcatalog - a point we're looking to rectify with a crop of no less than three new releases.\nThe second of this new triad is LA, another statement of generative intent. A sonic exploration made with his trusty MANIAC sequencer and a heavily modified Roland MT-32. NYZ‚Äôs interest in Roland‚Äôs Linear Arithmetic synthesis technology dates back to the Roland D-10 in 1988, his third ever synth. We spoke to NYZ about this obsession :\n‚ÄúI wandered into Carlsbro Sound Centre [music shop at the top of Mansfield Road in Nottingham, UK] one day in 1988 and as luck would have it they were selling an ex-demo one at about half price. So I leveraged my Juno 106 in part exchange and got it for even less. Top deal.\nNo regrets, it‚Äôs an ocean more interesting than the 106 for what I was doing. Besides, I still had my Jupiter 4 and Korg MS20 for analogue stuff, so it was a bit superfluous anyway. My ultra-tiny bedroom studio at the time needed a wider sound palette. The D-10 is not a great synf, but I like it. I had a real love-hate relationship with it for several years. Mainly gripes around certain programming limitations and the UI which is a bit painful.\nA key draw for me, apart from the PCM ROM samples, are the ‚Äòstructures‚Äô as Roland calls them. Some of them are additive, but a bunch of them are also Ring Modulator [RM] based. My RM obsession was already in full swing. I‚Äôd previously built a Practical Electronics / Phonosonics Ring Modulator, designed and sold by the legendary John Becker. This was was a key item in my studio, so the D-10 would fit in nicely.\nI got rid of the D-10 sometime in the 90‚Äôs. But those old digital Roland‚Äôs really do have a lovely sound, if you spend the time programming them up a bit. They really are best via a computer editor. I have a couple of D-110‚Äôs [which have the world's worst manual, and a UI to match], three MT-32‚Äôs and a D-5. The D-5 is only very slightly different, but actually better imho. The MT-32 is similar again, but has a fairly different set of ROM samples in it + two of mine have the ultra rare Robin Whittle mod. I don‚Äôt have a D-50, but I got the D-05, which is their boutique remake that got discontinued just after they made it :( come on Roland, hit us up with another from the LA stable one day, plz! :) ‚Äù\nAs for the music on this album, you can rest assured this is some classic NYZ gear and then some. LA sonically connects with and departs from his other outings such as RLD GLD and NTE GDN. Here we see NYZ really focusing his auditory microscope. LA represents the start of yet another intense series of synthetic investigations. We open up with a couple of short fun algorithmic ditties, NYZ even breaks out the whistle PCM sound here! After this opening cleanser, he‚Äôs off into classic realms of cellular exploration in his own inimitable style. Morphing his own identity as he travels. The album‚Äôs entire second half is from three experimental sessions where his generative music systems explore something we can‚Äôt find words to properly describe. You‚Äôre on your own from this point on - we travelled out there. with no idea what planet we ended up on, but what a trip it was.\nSo watch out for more in the LA series at some unspecified time in the future!\n---\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Location is a composite recording, assembled via two sparse and barely processed room recordings from both of my previous studios (Rolling Knoll and Botany Bay), bound together with a noise generator and a sleep-deprived, lazy handed improvisation on the Korg MS-20 analog synthesizer. Channeled live across just over two hours through an Alesis Quadraverb patched into the vintage circuits of a JVC KD-A11 cassette deck and rendered down to a very low volume via the ample EQ curves of my Peavey FX2x24 mixing board. The result is a discrete atmosphere of occasional movement in a vast pool of white noise and vaguely tonal suggestion - spaces transmuted into sound, transfigured for spaces.\nNOTE: Like Ameliorator before it, Location is mastered at a quiet level, and it is recommended for playback on speakers/systems with a wide dynamic range, and headphones, preferably with noise cancelling capabilities.",

            "about": "Following his two-hour sections of the massive √òŒ®Œ¶II split, Arjen Schat returns to Ps√∏ma Psi Phi with a proper solo release named LXXIII. This recording came about partially after I urged Arjen to expand on an improvisation he did on his Rhodes electric piano (which was released as a part of the charity compilation 3067 Megs:  meganmccarthy.bandcamp.com/track/rhodes-improvisation  ), and he delivered beautifully, as he always does.\nTo my ears, LXXIII recalls so many of my favorite aspects of Arjen's music and other ambient milestones. The drifting overtone drones immediately conjure up things like Primal (a personal favorite of mine), while the sound of the Rhodes invokes the crystalline stillness of Eno & Budd's Plateaux Of Mirror. Further still, certain melodic sections of LXXIII feel weathered and isolated, sad even, in a similar fashion as Aphex Twin's essential work on SAW II (namely a track like \"Lichen\"). In short, there is a lot to love about this release, for fans of many different eras of classic and modern ambient music.\nArjen always displays such a masterful hand with his instruments, and an impressive level of restraint in both the performance and the production of a piece like this. Long may he continue to sculpt entire universes from the simple clay of vibrations floating through air.",

            "about": "OCR is the second nom-de-guerre for Brian Grainger and John-Paul Kramer's collaborative work - the first being Occur, which has (thus far) released two EPs and one LP at Recycled Plastics. Existing in tandem with Occur releases will be the OCR catalog here at Psoma Psi Phi - a parallel universe reimagining of the band's work, presented as extended beatless pieces instead of their more rhythmic electronic counterparts.\nThis first release, simply titled M, consists of two lengthy de/reconstructions of Occur's debut EP, Drum. If Drum could be the sound of the not-too-distant past in the history of electronic music, M is the incredibly far-flung future, where life as we know it has been wiped from the Earth, and all of civilization breaks down into so much dust and empty space. M solemnly hangs in the sour air, like a burned flag sagging off of a bent ruin. Gone are the signs of life or even nature herself, with only traces of regret and sadness running through the abandoned remains. A quiet night sets over the scene, looked down upon by meaningless stars in an indifferent sky. No more warmth, fire or blood. Just this.",

            "about": "Mosca returns to Psoma, following the brutalistic High Rise - an album of dystopian synthesis inspired by JG Ballard's novel of the same name - and the transcendent Sacred Space double-album - a collaborative work with a visual artist that recalls the stark minimalism of pioneers like Eliane Radigue and Alvin Lucier - with the aptly and simply named Meditations, consisting of four hour-long sessions of drone that shimmer and hum in the most sonorous ways.\nEach Meditation is specifically designed to liberate the listener from a type of mental and emotional dissonance - fear, anger, pain and desire, respectively - and certainly, when listening, it is apparent that Mosca's timbres and their different frequencies overlap in harmonious relationships, bringing a sense of calm stillness to the body, and hopefully relaying these sensations to the brain, where the real work must be done.\nAnd yet, these recordings must also acknowledge the futility of such an effort - the biological fact that we cannot simply re-wire ourselves to divorce our minds from our bodies, much as we may feel compelled to, given the world and time we find ourselves living through - but still they persist in their denial of that world, a tangible line of disconnection drawn between our inner selves and our outer suffering.\nFor us, these sessions are more than simply music, they are a tool to be employed, not if but when the world becomes too much for us to bear. They cannot themselves alleviate or erase the fear and anger we feel, or the pain inflicted upon our bodies, and they cannot supplant or satiate our desires, no matter how modest they may sometimes be, but they can soften the blows of these things. They can provide a very real and useful mechanism with which to process grief and suffering, and in turn, if this recontextualizing of pain allows one of us more opportunities to push more positivity into the world, then perhaps in this sense, the Meditations do quantitatively improve the state of things.\nOf course, what feels harmonically sound and relaxing to us may be incongruous dissonance to someone else with different eardrums, different cranial dimensions or curvatures - indeed, such small details from person to person can affect oceans of differences in how the brain and body respond to simple sustained frequencies - but the intent remains immutable. There is no right or wrong way to accomplish what Mosca has set out to do here - the revelation is in the doing, in the grasping of that power we possess as humans, to design and manifest systems that help us become more of ourselves, and less of the imprinted surroundings that are inevitably cast upon all of us. Should we wish for more, for better, we can accomplish it, starting with ourselves.\nNOTE: This digital release is an abridged version of the complete album, and only includes the first of four discs of material. Listeners who would like to hear the full album are encouraged to purchase the physical edition to do so.",

            "about": "David Burraston returns to Psoma Psi Phi with his seventh release for the label, and fifth bearing the Noyzelab moniker. Metal Cell Meditations is the fourth of a five-part series that will be issued serially between October 2018 and February 2019.\nThe recordings presented here are, as the title implies, intended to assist in meditation, and operate as minimalistic walls of humming drones, parsed out into pre-determined \"dosages\", to assist in their usage as a utility. Only have three minutes before you have to go to work? There's a 3-minute Cell Meditation for you here. Need a harmonic backdrop for your yoga session or your power nap? Cell Meditations also come in 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30-minute sections. For those of you seeking a deeper experience, Burraston has also provided 45 and 60-minute versions of these Meditations, perfect for disconnection, introspection and all manner of subconscious stimulation. As is his usual, Burraston's work treats time itself as an elastic band that passes by at a rate of his choosing, and for this we've come to be quite addicted to these recordings, even finding ourselves lost inside a three-minute drone. In this fashion, Noyzelab has essentially created an infinite generative structure, and these segments are in fact windows of varying lengths of time, through which we're able to observe and experience something that is impossibly large and unfathomably deep. Be careful with these Meditations - even the artist himself has issued a text advisory in the notes for these recordings - for they are potent and finely distilled examples of the current the universe itself moves through, from element to element.\nNOTE: The digital version of NYZ-VII contains only the 20-minute Meditation. For the full and unabridged Metal Cell Meditations experience, listeners may purchase the limited edition 3xCD-R set.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Metal Edict is one such 'sleep fiction' as mentioned in the label's statement of intent, and a deep listening experience for both headphones and room playback. Built using a single source recording of a piezoelectric microphone attached to an industrial appliance, which then became layered and processed via a number of studio machines and effects units, Metal Edict hovers like a fog on a distant and desolate planet. Red sand dunes as high as mountains, like frozen waves, ripple across a surrealistic landscape, and somewhere inside the cloudy haze above them we can make out a single inorganic structure - a dark plinth, a solitary watcher standing what could be miles into the sky. This much is all there is to observe and contemplate, the rest has been left unsaid by the artist's subconscious, leaving Metal Edict to provide a liminal space between here and there. Meaningful or meaningless? Substantial or vacant? Purposeful or random? There are no words etched on this Metal Edict to provide an answer.",
            "credits": "released March 29, 2019\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at White Pillar Workshop, March 2019, using a piezoelectric microphone in tandem with pitch processors, analog/digital reverberation and delays and a number of resonant low-pass filters and parametric equalizers. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Ps√∏ma Psi Phi number √òŒ®Œ¶X.",

            "about": "For his twenty-fifth release in the ongoing NYZ catalog, David Burraston arrives with MM2, a nearly seventy-minute exploration of the GForce Minimonsta2. The Minimonsta2 itself is a software replication of Moog's well-known Model D subtractive analog monosynth, albeit with some modern additions, such as a reverb effect and the ability to modulate the pulsewidth of oscillator 1.\nIn the past, Dave's had little opportunity through the years to play around on a Minimoog - stray sessions here and there - and until now, he's been unable to find the 'sweet spot' on the machine for his particular requirements. Thanks to the generosity of Jerome Meunier at GForce, Dave was sent a copy of the Minimonsta2 software, finally allowing him a deep dive on the instrument, and the resultant recording is as transcendent as any of the Cell Meditations sessions or other 'DRN' iterations before it.\nThe MM2 session consisted of a special drone-focused arrangement utilizing four different instances of the Minimonsta2, each individually processed through a separate Serum FX strip. Each layer was spaced an octave apart, allowing for some ultra-subtle detuning and drift via the circuit modelling, as well as the FX.\nThis recording is a companion to other GForce synth sessions of ODT3 and SEM on Psoma, and the earlier OSC2 release on Superpang, continuing the software studies on those releases, while also conveying gorgeous pillars of drone music in the way that only NYZ methodologies can. The vibrations present on MM2 are like ripples in space-time, overlaid in psychedelic modulations with one another, expansive and incredibly dense all at once. MM2 is, like most NYZ recordings, highly recommended for headphone listening as well as higher-decibel playback on speaker systems with sufficient low frequency output.\n---\nInterested parties can get hold of GForce Minimonsta2 here:  www.gforcesoftware.com/products/minimonsta2/\nThanks to Jerome Meunier at Gforce, and additional thanks to Oli at ODDSound for Serum.\n---\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Blaubac, one of the few artists able to migrate between Psoma and her sister imprint Recycled Plastics, offers up Moments Scattered Like Sand as his debut within the Ps Ps Ph catalog. Though beatless, Moments could be considered a followup to Blaubac's RP entry (see: BC68 / A Dim Vision) - both have been created and carefully refined via a modular synthesis arrangement, and where A Dim Vision cast us into the fallout of a deleted-technology heavy world, Moments exiles us even further out into the wastes, past the borderlands, beyond the last vestiges of post-humankind and the afterbirths of civilization. Perhaps this reflection on/of bleakness is too intense for some, given the world's current outbreak-infested state, but for us here at Psoma, it is perfectly apt and well-timed. Something dark to cast your anger and frustration into, a pit of black quicksand to renew your sense of hope and purpose through this immutable vibrational ritual.",

            "about": "It's been over a year since Psoma issued new work in David Burraston's open-ended NYZ subcatalog - a point we're looking to rectify with a crop of no less than three new releases.\nThe first of this new triad is MTP4, the newest iteration in NYZ‚Äôs ongoing exploration with GForce software synthesis instruments. A real beauty, made using the M-Tron Pro IV, where we get to witness a spaced out long-form drone exploration in intricate slow motion. Apparently, NYZ has been witness to a real Mellotron in Bradbury‚Äôs studio too. Regarding the Mellotron he notes :\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a really amazing early tape based sample instrument, and the software version is incredible! It‚Äôs definitely out there on its own. Coming from the UK I also heard it back when it came out in the 60‚Äôs as a little kid. It left a lasting indelible impression on my mind. So the opportunity to have a great software version is really something else. When Jerome got in touch and asked if I was interested to have a copy I immediately said yes please! I was delighted and very grateful for their support. Awesome crew. Thanks folks! Once it was installed I disappeared for a few days, and this is one of the drone sessions I worked on. Utterly blissful I thought. I didn‚Äôt want to leave the studio, I thought I was in some crazy kiddy dream :)‚Äù\nWe happily invite you along with NYZ on another GForce synth session in the spirit of MM2, ODT3 and SEM on Psoma, and the earlier OSC2 release on Superpang. As an expanding series of releases, NYZ bathes us yet again in a gorgeous oceanic herbal bath of drone using his own pioneering methods and techniques. We have been enjoying it here of a late evening, but this is a ‚Äútotally anytime/anywhere you need it‚Äù piece of work.\n---\nInterested parties can get hold of GForce M-Tron Pro IV here:  www.gforcesoftware.com/products/m-tron-pro-iv/\nThanks to Jerome Meunier and everyone at Gforce, and additional thanks to Oli and everyone at ODDSound for Serum.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Cut from the same deep sessions that yielded Bacchus Tapes 6 (Poseideon:  cordtapes.bandcamp.com/album/poseideon  ) and the two Multiplicative pieces presented on the Psoma 29 split with NYZ, these three longform recordings are detailed and hypnotic studies of feedback in motion: sampled, looped, overlaid in multiple pitches equally tuned apart from one another, until a swirling sea of incomprehensible frequency-bending wash surrounds the listener, filling up eardrums, rooms, whole universes, before being pulled down the drain of a black-hole low pass filter. A no-input configuration using an SSM-1750 mixing board (built and sold by Radio Shack in 1995) was the sole sound source utilized to create these intense landscapes.\nInspired by recordings from the noisier and quieter end of the beatless music and synthesis spectrum (Vainio, Chartier, Aube, Lopez, Omit, Acre), Psoma 30 can be used as a mental cleansing device, a utility of equalization and balancing, recalibrating and resetting your input receivers to better function after you've been completely clogged up by the information age. Additionally, it can also take the form of a negating fortress, an impenetrable wall that drowns out the difficult and unpleasant outside world that many of us wish to remove ourselves from at various times.\n100% of the proceeds from sales of Psoma 30 (as well as Psoma 29) will be sent to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

            "about": "Murmur To The Night arrives as Psoma 38, bearing a nearly 3 hour digital component and a more modest 70 minute CD-R edition. Being one of my first sessions to come from building a modular synthesizer system, this recording was significant for being the first time my yet-to-be-named R-EW Audioholistics system would be able to convey more subtle and restrained audio, rather than the usual \"severe\" and angular material it was capable of in the very beginning. Murmur feels influenced by a number of classic synthesizer recordings, from Radigue's Adnos to Eno's Neroli, with notable nods to Teibel's Tintinnabulation as well, while being wholly apart from all of these things. It feels dimly lit and cautious, perhaps filled with the sense that the ground could drop out from beneath you at any moment in the undefined darkness. It also feels sloth-like and languorous, content to remain close to motionless for extended periods. Recorded during the Springtime of 2020, when the pandemic was just beginning to get a death-grip, Murmur kept me company during many restless nights, when I needed something to distract me from the outside world, and focus again on a quiet and dark room.",

            "about": "MYZTRYZ is a tripartite assemblage of unpublished material, hailing from as far back as eleven years ago, in the Noyzelab studio. An overflowing cornucopia of pointillistic and synthesized delights, no maps or detailed notes are provided to aid the listener, offering a freefall into chaotic and overstimulating sound-worlds that could be compared to the sensation one gets listening to Coltrane's 'Ascension' for the first time. Chaos has always been close to the core of Burraston's work, both in his studies and his music, exploring and organizing microcosms of possibility, through methods both arcane and academic, and on MYZTRYZ this focus dominates. Still, for all of the complexity and surrealism present in these collage-like constructs, NYZ feels as playful as ever, with moments of hesitant uncertainty in the shadows abruptly giving way to splashing in oily puddles with childlike abandon - both approached with mathematical clarity. MYZTRYZ, for several reasons, could be considered Burraston's 'Out to Lunch' as much as it could also be a 'Greatest Hits' retrospective in some parallel universe. Everything presented here feels unique, formidable in one way or another, but still familiar, owing to Burraston's inimitable way with the machines and their systems. This is expansive, surrounding music that confounds as much as it compels - as Iggy Pop once wisely said: \"What sounds to you like a big load of trashy old noise is in fact the brilliant music of a genius.\"\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "\"O-E U\" is a branching path from Milieu's \"Enantiomorphosis III\" and was recorded during the same session, with the same patch and equipment, albeit with a different scale in the sequencer and a different post-processing approach. As an LSZ composition, it is the mid-point between \"Sill\" and the forthcoming \"Aius Loquens\" in its exploration of resonators and unorthodox sequencing.\n\"O-E U\" consists of the Behringer 1047 module, a re-creation of the resonator present in the ARP 2500 system, which acts as a pingable filter with notch, low-pass, high-pass and band-pass output signals, and it is also able to track pitch reasonably well, for a self-oscillating filter. This machine was sequenced in the Trivalent scale in Zeus temperament 7, with the Ornament & Crime multipurpose module, taking timing information from a constantly changing trigger array that consists of Boolean gates and two different sub-dividers - one even-numbered (Doepfer A-160), and one probabilistic (Cute Labs' Missed Opportunities). A Turing machine system was utilized to decide the values for rests/sustains, note choices and octaval differences in the sequencer, and the final resultant audio was given a wider stereo profile using Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay system. From here, the recording was overlaid onto itself in two subsequent pitch iterations - one an octave up, sent through a different panned stereo delay, and the other an octave down, sent through a feed-forward reverb system using a Householder matrix in Airwindows, which was itself multed and played with an offset between the stereo channels.\n\"O-E U\" is what I'd consider both functional as comforting ambient listening, as well as engaging at the compositional level when the listener chooses to focus on it, once again reiterating for the umpteenth time what Eno defined all those years ago. I find it fascinating to have published different albums under different project headings connected at a deep level, almost as if they can consider each other as parallel universe counterparts. Neither one is the true work, both are reflections in an imperfect mirror that descends into a deeper green the further you look.",

            "about": "For his tenth release at Psoma Psi Phi, David Burraston brings us a new hour of Noyzelab recordings bearing the title Octalz. Two sets of three related tracks (KW1octalR and RLDoctalMPP, respectively) that shift slowly between foggy, static atmospheres and looping passages of chords that seem outright melodic compared to Burraston's usual fare in our catalog. Rest assured, Octalz remains alien and distant, defying conventional description or traditional genre trappings, instead bathing the listener in sheets of textures that seem both thin and warm at the same time. Quick and dirty comparisons might mention names like Mika Vainio's √ò recordings or even Oval's 94 Diskont, but deeper and repeated listening will reveal Burraston's inimitable sonic fingerprint, which seems more and more like that of an engineer on some archaic starship - built in our near-future but kept afloat centuries later, filled with green screens and bulky disk drives and overheating analog circuitries. Burraston is endlessly tinkering, considering, refitting and revising the things that serve other musicians as instruments, but to him, are simply tools. His recordings suggest a universal harmony that can be found in feedback paths, algorithmic processing and pure random noise, perhaps the outline of some mathematically definable but otherwise unfathomable shape in the silent chaos of stellar bodies and celestial objects. Octalz is the latest transmission from this surveyor of the frontier, bringing the void (and all of its great and terrible possibilities) closer to us.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Continuing from SEM with his exploration of GForce software instruments, Burraston builds a wall with the Oddity3, an expansive modern iteration of the ARP Odyssey that includes several new additions and functions. ODT3 consists of two such instances of the Oddity3 to accomplish the wide stereo image, both focusing on the 4035 ladder filter from the short-lived Odyssey mark II (only one of three filter types present within the softsynth). Landing somewhere on the map between the Cell Meditations and the subharmonic hums of TESCO SYNFETIX, ODT3 pulses in shallow waves that betray the depth beneath their softened surfaces. Close listening yields wondrous results, especially in headphones, as the swirling mass of the frequency spectrum slowly rises like a shipwreck called back to shore. Almost imperceptibly, the true substance of this piece is revealed in microscopic increments, until it overtakes the senses and surrounds everything, filling the air with vibrating particulate and soporific electricity, glimmering like a portal to an adjacent dimension.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

            "about": "Hailing from Italy, Giulio Fontana offers an engaging contribution to the fine art of using no-input mixers as instruments. \"Omega\" was made entirely with a Mackie 1202-VLZ mixer, and has generously been given to Psoma Psi Phi's growing catalog without further comment. Newcomers to the approach of making music in this fashion should take note of the warmth and approachability of \"Omega,\" characteristics that are not typical of the recordings made with this methodology, and it is the sincere hope of all at Psoma that Fontana continues his work in this field.",

            "about": "Originally broadcast for International Sloth Day in an online A/V stream on October 20th, 2022, 'Pale Blue' is a generative ambient recording that was composed in realtime by the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. It consists of a patch centered around Mutable Instruments' Rings, a digital Karplus-Strong synthesizer, being sequenced in the Dorian scale by two Ornament & Crime modules with timing information coming from a Turing machine.\nThis broadcast followed Milieu's 'Creation' - a twelve-hour overnight session - that quietly started a series of longform generative ambient works issued twice a month, following an online stream of the patch, however 'Pale Blue' was much more modest in length, at only two hours, and so it was decided that it would be better suited to a release here at Psoma.\n'Pale Blue' is being offered as a low-priced digital release and physically as a limited edition 2xCD-R set. It can now be seen as a figurative branch between Milieu's work in the Psoma catalog and the ongoing longform broadcasts happening outside of it, and would appeal to any listeners that enjoy generative sound, slow-motion synthesis and indistinct yet accessible audio that may be used as a utility for reading and writing, sleeping and meditating, painting and programming.",

            "about": "It started sometime during the night, as the first buildings fell. Without warning, the black was lit up in orange as dozens of small charges were dropped from invisible metal wings. The distant bombs woke you as you dreamt of a shore you've never visited, and the sound was so thick that you could not be certain how far away it really was. You sat up, and looked outside, unable to see much through the growing smoke clouds that filled the neighborhood like a grey fog. Living beneath the overpass, you'd become accustomed to the sounds of vehicles and people moving through the air around you, but the vibrations emanating from deeper in the city were alien compared to that.\nA faint tone began to emerge from between the impacts - perhaps planes, or sirens, or both? - it was impossible to tell what was happening. Without a second hesitation, you packed your knapsack with the essentials, and grabbed a small battery-operated radio on your way outside. The car was a lost cause, useless in this smoke cover, and who knew what state the roads were in. No, this was a departure you needed to make on foot.\nYou turned your gaze toward the fence at the end of your street, the opposite direction from the city, and swiftly jumped it to land unsteadily on the dirt, still wet under the dew of the evening. Picking up a stride, with your back to civilization, you passed by the old water tower, and jumped a ditch that carved out the last line of demarcation between your subdivision and the deeper, untamed woods. Like Lot walking away from Sodom and Gomorrah, you understood that things may never be the same - how could they be? Or, perhaps more importantly, why should they be? Answerless questions, filler for a mind that was still trying to grapple with the idea that the human race could finally be finished.\nYou weren't sure what you expected to find, or where you expected to go, trespassing through the dark woods like this, but it was forward movement, and that was all you needed to feel okay. Hours passed, along with the very occasional pylon standing guard in long hallway-like cutaways leading back to the power grid - back to the death. Stopping at one such location, you startled under the sudden lights and drones of a plane zooming by overhead. You instinctively jumped back into the dark brush, feeling that whoever might be on that plane might not be looking for survivors. As the sound of the craft faded from earshot, trails of overtones came and went on the barely-there wind that blew through the trees. You were approaching an opening of some sort, a clearing or even a body of water, and the breeze pointed you toward it.\nEmerging from the forest, you stood silently at the precipice of a man-made lake. You'd never seen this before, and certainly it wasn't on any maps. An almost imperceptible hum wavered up from beneath the stone walls that held the still water. As your ears followed it, your eyes met with muted lights in a circular formation, far below the wet surface. In your hand, you tightened your grasp a little around the small radio, which began to crackle to life with strange sounds. Something was coming into range, on the AM band, and your fingers carefully nudged the dial toward it.\n\"You've found us\" crawled out of the small radio speaker, the voice a whisper between the bands. The circle of lights began a slow advance to the surface.",

            "about": "Initially recorded between Summer and Autumn of 2009, then stashed away in the shade for almost nine years, my collaborative full-length album with Peter Wright is now finally issued forth into the universe. A mammoth album of drones, feedback, sub-bass harmonics and psychedelic textures, set across three different pieces, Peint Arbre is a dense and enveloping trip through the tangential and exploratory minds of two men, working almost 8,000 miles apart.\nPeter Wright, if you are unaware, is an outright legend of drone music, guitar improvisation and spectacularly filmic textures, having been active in the New Zealand experimental music culture since 1992. I've long been influenced by his recordings, and in 2009 I was lucky enough to host his epic Snow Blind double-album at INSTALL, the now-defunct label I co-operated with David Tagg. We followed Snow Blind with a vinyl release of Wright's transcendent Orbit, and he also guested on my One Bleak Try album, lending many additional layers of sonic seasoning to the track \"Black Rust Caress.\"\nSince INSTALL closed its doors years ago, I've wanted to give this unreleased album we did a proper release. Since so much time had passed, Peter decided to revisit the recordings and add/subtract some things to bring it into its present form (so for those few out there who heard this album in its previous iteration, this is a different beast). Peint Arbre is an interesting cross-pollination of my distorted bass monolith drones, generated using guitar and organ in the Rolling Knoll studio, and Peter's contributions of guitars, vocals, percussion and all sorts of other instruments. Indeed, it feels very alive, and that is almost all Peter's doing - I merely provided the initiative steps. So it follows that hopefully another collaboration is due between us, and the door is of course always open for Peter to issue something of his own here at Ps√∏ma Psi Phi.",

            "about": "Polysilicon is perhaps better known as Chris Moore, a producer who has been issuing varying shades of electronic music under the name While since the mid-nineties, starting with a track on Skam's MASK 400, and continuing onward via Chocolate Industries, Musik Aus Strom and even our beloved friends at Earstroke (see: Ourson's 'Collected Natures I-III'). His first album under the Polysilicon name is Phase Accumulator, and it exists in a very different part of the electronic music landscape than While recordings previously occupied.\nRecorded entirely live using only a Yamaha TX216 and an Eventide H949, Phase Accumulator is a tableaux of droning timbres and machine minimalism that conjures blurry visions of color, temperature and light, which feel impossibly synthetic and starkly elemental, sometimes simultaneously. This kind of material should feel alluring and familiar to our long-time listeners, who are more than familiar with the glassy tones of FM carriers and operators, and the unorthodox shapes that this type of improvisational exploration often yields.\nThe thirty-six minutes offered here seem to convey a far deeper well, elongating the runtime by way of manipulated perception, and many of the pieces could continue to oscillate forever. Surrealistic, at times chaotic, but always fascinating and expressive in ways that even these words fail to describe, Phase Accumulator is a trip best taken with headphones or on a surround system with adequate low-frequency output, and an unexpected companion to the slow thawing of the Winter season.",

Originally, all three sinewaves were designed to be played separately via different output systems on endless tape loops, but this method of presentation was abandoned and the assemblage offered here is what remains of the session.",

            "about": "After much preparation and discussion, the first volume of a new and ongoing series from David Burraston has arrived at Psoma: PLL, a catalog of recordings made using Phase Locked Loops.\nFor this first excursion Dave is using the Doepfer A-196 Phase Locked Loop module. The PLL is, even by Doepfer's own admission, an unusual and unpredictable device, which is remarkable considering the wild frontier of ideas that populate the modular music world. It continues to either astound or confound music makers who are new to its specific strengths and unorthodox charms. In layman's terms, the PLL uses a voltage controlled oscillator, a phase comparator and a low-pass filter in a combinatorial way, alongside two external input signals to track various aspects and adjust them internally according to a set methodology. The result is often an untamed and colorful source of processed audio and/or angular modulation, although, like many Doepfer modules, the PLL can act as an external sound processor or a sound generator itself.\nThis is where Burraston arrives to both discern what is happening inside the PLL, and to shape and guide it according to his own conceptual bent. We here at Psoma cannot say we fully understand what Burraston is doing on these recordings, even though we ourselves use the PLL in our own modular system, but that liminal space between recognition and unfamiliarity is often where NYZ recordings reside - threading a cosmically large tapestry with electricity, while most listeners experiencing this process from the outside will not be able to distinguish the advanced experimentalism from pure, mind-melting magic.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Dave Burraston's newest entry in his expansive NYZ catalog is PMFM, a mind-melting exploration of FM synthesis as only he could facilitate it. Using the unimaginably deep EssenceFM synthesizer, which boasts a behemoth 300-voice polyphony, PMFM weaves into and out of spaces that feel fully elemental. Humming overtone-rich drones shiver and break apart as spasms of textural electricities disintegrate their surroundings. Strange resonance pervades a constantly shifting stereo field that brings to mind visions of parallel timelines overlapping in thin wavering halos. PMFM is as much a monumental accomplishment in the world of FM synthesis as it is a sonic black hole that pulses ever-present on the bleak horizon. A welcome disconnection from this reality, or any other.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

It is the sincere hope of the two sound recordists that this music exists as a balm of comfort for escaping from a world that is far too miserable for far too many people.\nPrior Juneteenth releases will also raise money for the NAACP:\npspsph.bandcamp.com/album/fm40p-m46torg-blym-zero-autofugue-via-four-operators-multitrack-tape\npspsph.bandcamp.com/album/fm80-carriers-ssm-1750-multiplicatives\npspsph.bandcamp.com/album/multisignal-amplification-studies-for-the-ssm-1750\nAnyone who spends $25 or more on the Juneteenth releases, in any combination, will be emailed a bonus download code for music of our choosing as thanks.\nLearn more about Juneteenth:  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth\nLearn more about the NAACP LDF:  www.naacpldf.org\nN.B.

            "about": "David Burraston returns to Ps√∏ma Psi Phi with possibly his most expansive release to date - PPLZ SYNF. A gigantic 3.5 hour work consisting of seven pieces created using an ongoing self-build (as Burraston notes) of the Serge/CGS Paperface analog synthesizer, in conjunction with a custom built modular rig. Laid to digital disk space at Burraston's Noyzelab studio in August, PPLZ SYNF is a monolith of drone synthesis that absorbs the listener into some kind of greater collective metaconsciousness. It is both an impressive exercise in longform drone music, and an immersive and hypnotic atmosphere that confounds the mind, transfiguring your surroundings from its unique and singular perspective. A monument, literally and figuratively, in the sound field, etched and erected by a master of the craft.\nGiven the scope and size of such a release, PPLZ SYNF has been committed to a very special, and very limited, triple-cassette set, housed in a dustproof binder. These are extremely finite and assembled by hand in every possible way, making no two copies exactly alike. The digital version available at Bandcamp consists of cuts from the first of the three tapes, while the full release is spread across two 60-minute tapes and one 90-minute tape.\nUPDATE 2018.03.04: The 4xCD-R reissue is now stocked at Norman Records in the UK  www.normanrecords.com/records/169774-nyz-pplz-synf\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Duenn is a self-described experimental composer from Fukuoka, Japan, who worked with me previously on the collaborative recording \"Presence\", issued at Opal Tapes in the UK. He approached Psoma some time ago, and through some correspondence we arrived at this beautiful quiet album called Psalm. Seven tracks of evocative minimalism, one of which also features a collaboration with Takuro Okada (who previously released work with Duenn at Chihei Hatakeyama's White Paddy Mountain imprint three years ago). These pieces are warm and inviting, and easily imply scenes of stillness and contemplation in slow environments. Duenn's music works well for the intimate moments of introspection we all have, gazing out a window or waiting for sleep to claim us in our beds, and arrives right on time for a pleasant Autumn season here in the midwestern United States.\nDuenn and I have also completed a second collaborative recording, Absence, which will be released before the end of this year. Contented listeners are encouraged to explore Duenn's catalog of work, issued at such excellent places as LINE, Entr'acte, and/OAR and Past Inside The Present, as well as via Duenn's own self-released outlets.",

            "about": "Resonant Forms is the first three-way split release issued in the Psoma catalog, consisting of three different blocks (around 20 minutes each) of improvised music, contributed by three different guitarists: Adrien75, Brian Grainger (myself) and Rik Johnson.\nHaving been friends with and influenced by Adrien75 for several years, it was surprising to both of us to stumble over the fact that we were also both mutual admirers of Rik Johnson's beautiful work with the instrument. It felt predetermined then, that we should all at least attempt some kind of collaborative release, and once Rik agreed to join us for it, I set up the basic rules: We would each submit around 20 minutes of material, which could be a single piece or many different ones, using only live takes of improvised guitar music. There were no restrictions on processing or FX devices, only that there should be no overdubbing and everything played should be as informal and unprepared as possible. In short, I wanted to hear the sound of the three of us playing guitar, and nothing else.\nStylistically, what emerged is a beautiful set of performances that all seem to sense each other, despite each of us working separately without hearing what the other two were doing. All three of us used subtle detuning effects, filters and reverbs, making the set somewhat unified despite hundreds of miles and radically differing rigs between us.\nOpening the set is Adrien75's single piece, \"A Series Of Ordeals\", which is a suite of several movements in and out of looper sprawl and textured fray, that immediately recalls his lush guitar work on the landmark album Coastal Acces, issued in 2002 on Source Records.\nFrom there, Rik plays five different pieces of melancholic chord changes, gorgeously evoked from finger picked sections and overlaid lead lines that weave around in forward and reverse motions. Rik's work is the least well-known of the three of us, something Adrien and I feel is a criminal shame. It reminds me of lots of different things that I love about quiet and sad guitar music...Roy Montgomery, Manual, Loren Connors, even a little Mogwai. Hopefully, Psoma 16 puts Rik's work in more people's ears, where it clearly belongs.\nClosing the release is my contribution, \"Seconds\", a single extended piece I played using a handful of different pieces of processing FX that I'd inherited or bought from another close friend, guitarist and influence, David Tagg. \"Seconds\" is filled with looping mountains of ambient blues, similar to some of my past albums like Eight Thousander, Nine Billion Names and Blue Wheatfield.\nAfter completing the work for these pieces, we all three agreed that we'd like to attempt further iterations of this idea, in the future. For now, Resonant Forms stands as a very accessible and, we think, potent entry in the Psoma catalog, and an engaging sixty-minute tableaux of improvised guitar music that pairs well with the Autumn season.\nADRIEN75 :  adrien75.bandcamp.com\nRIK JOHNSON :  inanycasethemoon.bandcamp.com\nBRIAN GRAINGER :  briangrainger.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Following his excellent analog synth exploration of J.G. Ballard's \"High Rise\", Mosca returns with a collaborative double-album named Sacred Space, consisting of two extended sessions of luscious drifting synthesis that effectively \"score\" two original paintings by artist/designer Michelle Haswell hanging on his studio wall.\nThe first of two, \"Black (Sacred Space),\" unfurls a wide cloak of dusky chords across a full hour's runtime, alternating between subtler sections of closed-filter light trails and fuller, reverberant passages that offer a dimly lit view of an overcast landscape in the evening, on the precipice of a great storm. The second piece, \"Grey (A Passing Place),\" provides a dense and foggy counterpoint to the deep breathing swells of \"Black,\" with a thick haze of cloudy resonance that feels as if it could be made of evaporated sections of \"Black\" after the storm has passed.\nBoth pieces convey a beautifully mesmerizing atmosphere of darkness, where night is not a frightening time or place, but simply a respite from the brightness of the day. Listening to Sacred Space, one might find it hard to pinpoint where exactly the tonal and melodic shifts come to pass, that so effectively keep the recordings in motion and not quite definable as drone music, while maintaining the mystifying sense that these shapes are organic and elemental and alive, but almost imperceptibly slow.\nMosca will return for a third time later this year with Meditations, a massive quadruple-album set of intimate drones designed for various modes of disconnect.\nNOTE: The digital edition of Psoma 35 contains extended mixes of both pieces, while the 2xCD-R edition contains special CD-only edits.",

            "about": "For the first time on a physical format, Psoma Psi Phi offers up a complete collection of the first \"season\" of thirteen deep ambient Thalo Blue recordings. These pieces were originally issued one at a time, the first being released in March 2019, and were published with zero biographical information or provenance. They were made available only as digital downloads at the Thalo Blue Bandcamp page (  000f89.bandcamp.com  ) and only now have been assembled into a definitive release. Preferring to show and not tell, Thalo Blue seems to be a generative process that transfigures television broadcasts into lush ambient sound, and while we were able to make contact with the mind(s) behind Thalo Blue (and its sister project, Thalo Green) and officially license this edition, we have been asked to respect the agency of the artist and refrain from any further discussion about who they are, where they're from and why they've made these recordings.\nMusically, the Thalo Blue recordings sound oceanic, with swells of watery chords soaked in dark reverberation, ebbing in and out of gentle washes of white noise. They bring to mind some of Eno's early work such as On Land, albeit much more elongated and abstract, in the way that they seem to paint scenes and locations with a minimum of information. The sounds shift through many different sections of varying color depth, sometimes sounding like organs, other times resembling gusts of wind, with some moments even implying things like human voices, whale songs or orchestral instrumentation.\nThey are a direct contrast from the Thalo Green recordings, which are far longer in runtime, and more monochromatic in their range, and the most distinct difference is that while Thalo Green's pieces are titled only with dates, Thalo Blue's pieces all bear very vivid names, all of which seem to evoke the natural world, the elements and even specific locations such as Mount McKinley in Alaska - notable for being the highest mountain peak in all of North America.\nIt is our sincere hope that Psoma's re-publishing of these recordings will bring them to a wider audience that we feel will truly benefit from their effects, both long and short term, and this hope is equaled by another, that the mind(s) behind Thalo Green and Thalo Blue will continue to record new music in the future.\nNOTE: Due to the considerable amount of audio contained in this release, Psoma Psi Phi has elected to issue the material on two DVD-R discs, which contain the original unaltered 16-bit 44100Hz WAV format audio files that were sent to us. We feel that this keeps the ritual of a physical edition intact and available, while also reducing unnecessary shipping bulk and material costs. All standard DVD players and computers should be able to play these discs, although for more practical/portable listening, users are encouraged to generate their own lossy file conversions.",

            "about": "SEM is a long form drone made using a single instance of the GForce SEM - a faithful recreation of the 1974 Oberheim monophonic analog synthesizer, reinstated on the occasion of Tom Oberheim's birthday. Not completely familiar with the machine prior to this session, but previously having played with other Oberheim designs such as the Matrix 6R and XPander, Burraston opted to simply explore it without any additional machines or effects processors, in order to allow the SEM to illustrate its personality naturally, which resulted in the gorgeous pillar of tone that sits before you now. Thematically, SEM relates to prior NYZ recordings such as OSC2 at Superpang and the independently released BS2::DRN4, although avid listeners will appreciate the uniqueness of SEM even when aligned with earlier work. SEM was made possible with the generous assistance of Jerome Meunier at GForce & AFX, and is offered as the twenty-first recording issued in the NYZ subcatalog at Psoma, continuing a rich lineage of vivid synthesizer music and unmapped experimentation.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Dominic Razlaff, hailing from Braunschweig, Germany, is the guiding hand behind the prolific DR moniker that has issued music with labels such as Lagerst√§tte, Tandem Tapes, Shimmering Moods, Histamine Tapes (and literally dozens more). He has offered a careful and considered ambient piece called Sencha to Ps√∏ma Psi Phi, a welcome addition to the growing catalog. Soft, quiet and understated, Sencha almost sounds as if it is the shadow of something else that is never completely revealed. Implied shape, deferred movements, distant vibrations all coalesce into a singular focused breath, exhaling across 56 minutes. On a more personal level, Sencha arrived at a time of loss, and very much helped to soothe when soothing was necessary. We hope that it will continue to be a balm to those in need of a calm and comforting space, and we warmly welcome Dominic to the P / Psi / P estate.",

            "about": "Having worked together on many different occasions in the past, Arjen Schat and I have once again collaborated for this massive P / Psi / P release.\nEssentially a four-part album of two original pieces and two reinterpretations, Shapes Perceived In Blackness consists first of \"Mantra\", a nearly hour-long piece from Arjen's studio of a few years ago now. It would not feel out of place next to works like Primal or Oppidium Arnoldi Villa, both records I've spent literal years inside, exploring. Arjen's work was paramount for my mental health when my daughter Penelope was born and came home from the hospital. When I could only take small breaks for rest, Arjen's music was constant at my bedside, effectively deflating the stress from my mind and body and letting me get the most out of the downtime I had.\nBacking Arjen's stellar piece is an equally long atmosphere titled \"Obviation\", which was also recorded years ago now, and for one reason or another, left to quietly age in a box in the studio. Intended as a tape-worn, humid companion piece to Arjen's crystalline monolith, \"Obviation\" recalls the sticky Summer nights so frequently present in my old studio in the subtropics. Hovering, almost-chords waft between slow gusts of air, analog fuzz and hiss-crusted phaser waves.\nI was recently honored with the invitation to pen the liner notes inside Arjen's forthcoming vinyl LP Spectrum (check it out here:  arjenschat.nl/album/spectrum  ) but I feel it is pertinent to note that this release should also serve as evidence for just how much love and respect I hold for Arjen's work. That we can continue forward with our ideas in any kind of unison is a pleasure and a career highlight for me.\nNOTE: The physical version of this release comes with two more extended pieces, each of us reinterpreting and recontextualizing each other's piece, making it a four-disc affair. The additional 2-disc release is titled Colors Perceived In Silence, and is exclusive to the physical format.",

            "about": "Following his Psoma debut Sencha, Dominic Razlaff returns with a sun-kissed set of four ambient pastorales, aptly named Sonnenschein. Round warm tones and fuzzy field recordings coalesce to provide a perfect companion to the melting Winter ice as the cold recedes and allows a bright green Spring to flourish. Texturally and chordally similar to other Psoma releases such as Milieu's Wind Over Hill and Saito Koji's Winter Journal, Sonnenschein is a blanket of drifty sound matter for you to curl up inside, filled with the wordless and surrealistic comforts of a waking dream.",

            "about": "Recorded on the vernal equinox, the beginning of Spring in the Northern hemisphere, this aptly named piece offers a ray of sunlight to warm yourselves beside in the Winter. The band, Picture Rather Muted, consists of Psoma alumni Nicholas Maloney (also known as Blanket Swimming) and Victoria Maloney, who collaborate in sonic as well as photographic terms.\nTo our ears, 'Spring Equinox' is like a blanket to surround yourself with, full of humming timbres that have been assembled with careful and patient hands. It would appeal to fans of sustained tone minimalism (such as the previous catalog contributions from Limestone Ziggurat, Mosca, Leigh Coleman, NYZ and of course Maloney himself) and will yield much richer listening experiences with either a nice set of headphones, or an open-air speaker system with considerable bass frequency output.\nListeners interested in more from PRM can visit:  picturerathermuted.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "SRi RLD could be David Burraston's most accessible release at Psoma to date. It presents ever-shifting movements between melodic bell-like tones and more breathy sustained passages of metallic pipe pitches, and the four pieces offered occupy a unique position for a NYZ album, which allow them to be experienced in an abstract wash of sound, as you might normally approach NYZ recordings, or they can be focused on in different moments, forming melodious shapes and suggestions of harmony and resolution. In this way, SRi RLD is perhaps more in the vein of classic ambient music by Eno, Carlos, Rabe and Lucier - compositions that could be appreciated to the same degree that they could be ignored, by design. As ever, Burraston continues to offer the widest array of synthesized sound from his studies, a continually tantalizing journey for the rest of us to eavesdrop on as it comes to pass.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "Unexpectedly, much like the previous catalog entry Wind Over Hill, Summer Evaporated emerged as a tangential exploration of an outtake from the recently completed sessions for an album called Daughter. It felt appropriate to append this release to Psoma 6 as an extension, as it once again addresses the changing of seasons - something that has far more weight and dynamism living here in an Ohio valley, than it did (or didn't) in the Carolinian subtropics. Evaporated is a more (more?) minimalistic exercise than Wind, echoing the lethargy at the end of warm months, a resignation to the cool air, burnt leaves and fading greenery.\nInto the welcoming arms of Autumn, bountiful cornucopia of orange hue and cinnamon smoke, melted down around the sun-cast apples of Summer. Open a window, lie down with an old paperback and listen to the sound of the sunshine dissolving into perfumes of dust and hiss, fertilizing the Earth as it sleeps beneath the soil...",

            "about": "An alternative mix of \"Sustain\", which originally appeared alongside David Burraston's field recordings of Bethungra Dam on a split release (Psoma 18), offered as a longer and deeper experience, yielding totally different harmonic responses and glacial, resonant tones now brought to the forefront of audio playback systems with a wide range of output and ample sub-bass response. Inspired in equal parts by Earth, Folke Rabe and Aube, Sustain explores the relationships of resonant metal-coil springs through careful sampling and processing via an array of modern and not-so-modern sampler systems, including a Boss RC-20 & RV-3, Alesis Quadraverb, Korg ES-1 & Volca Sample and an Akai S2800, with final mastering and editing taking place in a software environment using filtering and reverberation tools developed by Arturia, Image Line and Goldwave.",

            "about": "While an otherwise unaware observer might think that issuing five triple-album sets of Noyzelab drones, in five months, might be too much, those in-the-know will understand that there is no such thing as \"maximum\" when it comes to David Burraston's drones. They are endless macrocosms of sound, a sonic drug of transmuted galactic bodies and alchemical distillation. They ARE.\nSo, it is with great pleasure that Ps√∏ma Psi Phi is able to offer the first NYZ release in the catalog since the 4xCD DSP TRX: a three-track 90-minute excursion bearing the title TESCO SYNFETIX.\nTESCO, at first listen, may seem to hover in the air with a static disposition, but upon deeper listening (and especially at higher volumes) it becomes quite clear that this is not a stasis of any kind, but a LONG and SLOW vessel moving glacially through fluorescent space. The occasional buzz and rattle of a machine in an adjacent room occurs, a subtle reminder of this synthesized passage through some unmapped void. The high frequency whine of what could be thousands of hydraulic veins pries open the stereo field to blinding widths, and the soft detuned midrange fog of CRT monitors and ground hum massage the eardrums beneath it. Further back, further down and further out are sublime sub-bass structures, the warm engine core of whatever this gargantuan ship really is.\nThe whole physical experience of TESCO SYNFETIX brings to mind what it might sound like to travel inside something, that is inside a larger something, that is moving behind and between dimensions at unfathomable speeds, folding spacetime to reach otherwise impossible destinations. A psychedelic and illuminating listen, no matter what your mind's eye casts out for the duration, and an engrossing addition to Burraston's masterful catalog of synthesizer music at Ps√∏ma Psi Phi.\nNOTE: The limited edition 90-minute cassette contains the complete and unabridged TESCO SYNFETIX album, with three tracks. The digital version consists of only the second track.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "After months in the deep-freeze, we woke up, groggy and foggy in our clean white and silver habitrails. The rays of an unfamiliar sun made our eyes squint as we opened the ship's visor panels. As new as it was, it still felt enough like home. Even when you're asleep in your pod while the controls chart a path through the blackness for you, there's always this sensation that you can go a bit space-mad anyway, like you can feel the eyes of all those stars leering at you, an intruder trying to skate past their dominions. Shaking it off, we're pleased to see the readouts coming off the printer - oxygen and nitrogen and all the good stuff. It seems like all those engineers back on Earth really did their homework, because the system found us a viable place.\nSuiting up, we all checked each other's helmet seals, valves and vitals. Can't be too sure, even with Earth science and the virtues of centuries of engineering prowess - if we stepped out and suffocated or vaporized it wouldn't matter then if you were Hawking himself. All the same, we were eager to see what happened, because why take the trip if you're not willing to open the door when you get there? As if he'd heard me ask this, rhetorical or otherwise, Koch chuckled for no apparent reason.\nAs the decom chamber hissed and spat, rudely reminding us that this was it, are you really sure, don't say I didn't warn you, our breaths hesitated in our earpieces as the first beams of that new sunlight pealed into our sterile cabin. Without thinking, or even feeling the weight of our atrophied bodies, we drifted out into a vibrant forest meadow, gloved hands out from our sides, softly touching strange flowers in pink and yellow hues that could only be described by a mind like Dali's. Off in the near distance, we could detect movement even if it didn't ping our sensors - the bushes that looked like swamp grass combined with some kind of fibrous moss swayed in a breeze before us.\nScanning the horizon led our eyes up, to the skyline. A few klicks away, a storm was coalescing, purple knots and rolling bedsheet textures shifted in a very dense cloud. Must have been electrical, because the lights on the back of Masters' suit started to blink out a bit. Wanting to be safe and not sorry, I touched my comm wristlet and asked Capozzi to do a deep scan with the meter reader. He was, like the rest of us, easily distracted by all the flowers, momentarily forgetting that he was anything but a man on another planet, not at all an astronaut with a master's in exometeorology.\nHearing my request, he complied absentmindedly and ran the sweep. The numbers pinged back on my visor overlay like a dot matrix laundry list. Koch always used to tell me I made the dumbest faces when I was reading off my visor - I'm sure all of us did though. That thing in the sky was most certainly electrical, and irradiated too, but thankfully our suits were built to compensate for such possibilities, so I made the temporary adjustments and sent the update out to the other three suits. They each briefly blinked an affirmative green before returning to their standard operation blues.\nWe pressed on, advancing slowly but steadily toward the clouds, along the way stopping to look at the weird curls the leaves and branches had grown into, doing doubletakes, continually re-realizing that these weren't just some mutated oddities on Earth, but new horticultures entirely. Tagg would most certainly have a field day with even a pocketful of samples, back home.\nHome - a very far off place now, and would we ever really see it again? We all jumped at the chance to get away from the globe and all those politicians and corporate neckbiters, but now, light years away from it, it all seems so petty, easily forgiven and forgotten, simpler to rationalize and regret and rub the wound with the great \"What if?\" None of it mattered, we knew it might be good-bye forever the minute we stepped over the ship's threshold, but we did make it this far, and certainly that afforded us the right to now ask the question?\nThe first droplets of iridescent greenish rain speckled our helmets then, snapping me out of the nostalgic trance I'd slipped into. Masters lifted his arm to block out the sun that was now mostly behind and above us, to get a better look at the base of the clouds. Bright swirls of purples and deep dark blues flashed inside the dense mass, resembling veins more than electrical pulses, and prompting Koch to ask if this thing wasn't just a storm, but something alive? Capozzi snorted, his weatherman academic resurfacing: \"Aren't all ecosystems alive?\" \"You know what I meant\" Koch fired back. As if it wished to answer, we all quickly pivoted our heads upward to the mass as we perceived, not heard but felt, a voice:\n< < < ¬† W E ¬† A R E ¬† > > >\nCapozzi dropped the meter reader, where it made a soundless and limp show of rolling into a thicket of angel hair grass that was a bright orange. No one said a word. What do you say when something can just manifest in your brain's thought process? Somehow, we all knew that it wasn't an imagined thing, but boy oh boy was it a thing. Before one of us could even react physically, our nerves flooded with seratonin in a way that could only be described as that first time you went to an all-night rave, times ten. I fell to my knees and didn't need to look at the others to know they did too. All those thoughts of home, second thoughts, warm days of childhood looking at Nat Geo docs and science books on a sun-kissed carpet, wondering what it might be like, they came washing back over me like the most irresistible drug I'd ever taken. A tidal wave of pure bliss, freefalling into a prism of orgasmic physicality and universal acceptance.\nThe purples and blues of the storm overhead inverted into burnt oranges and primary greens, nothing remotely natural but comforting and welcoming all the same. From beyond these sheets of color, dappling around us like ink drops in a vase filled with spring rain, something was singing to us. The more I tried to focus on syllables and words, the more it seemed to evade comprehension. We'd gone full-on Dave Bowman in ways that we could never have anticipated, it was just like all those old Twilight Zone episodes, where the Earthmen thought they'd worked out all possibilities and still their hubris managed to land them in surrealistic circumstances, well beyond their pay grades.\nThat question I'd asked myself came back in the midst of all the ululating, why buy the ticket if you won't take the trip? If I'd had any breath left in my lungs, I'd have laughed, but it was just another facet of the weird experience we were drawn into - I couldn't detect my breath, or my blinking eyelids, or even my heartbeat. It seemed as if I'd been plucked straight out of my body, and if I could be honest it didn't feel that bad, just different, like when you step into a pool expecting it to be colder and it just feels slightly less than warm. Easily adjustable, submissive and forgiving. I let myself fall further down, into whatever this place or time or event really was. The further I went, the less it mattered at all. The brass would have been pissed - \"Stand up! Fire the rayguns! Get ahold of yourselves!\" - but none of that was anything but noise. Let the brass come down here and take a sip of this cosmic smack and see how much they gave a fuck about a laser or a readings report.\nOnward we drifted, and I say we because even now (or was it then?) I could feel all of us - Koch, Capozzi, Masters and myself - circling the drain of some great opening that was filling up with progressively brighter yellow light. It had us, whatever it was, there was no turning back now and this thing could have been an accretion disk for all we knew / we'll know. Everything was happening as and before and after itself, moments were swirling around us like displaced fragments of noise in a gigantic modem. Still, the brightness and yellowed hues grew, overtaking us, and I couldn't help but wonder if this was preferable to whatever afterlife awaited us back on Earth. Or was this our destination all along? Were we dying, being eaten up by some alien intelligence, digested with the most exquisite sedatives human brains could ever perceive? Once again, that singing voice came back, like a humming mother lulling a baby to sleep after a nightmare, and it seemed to be more my own this time, than any other voice. I could tell that we were not dying because the certainties were coming back to me from a time when and where all this had already come to pass. There we were - four silversuited Earthmen, waving through the surface of a pond to ourselves, still enthralled in this foreign baptism, being born and reborn and dreaming and waking and remembering all at once, again and again.\nThe shuddering ripples of the water's surface slowed eventually, as I realized that each new breath I inhaled made less of a movement before me. I reached out my gloved hand and instead of pushing through the surface, I splashed the water inches from my helmet, looking down at our reflection, prostrated and renewed at the water's edge. The storm had subsided, and we'd made it through, somehow, to this terminus point, but one glance back at the others was enough to tell me that it wasn't quite that simple. We'd swam like babies down a birth canal, or perhaps like dolphins in a stormy sea, wandering into deeper waters than we'd ever known, and emerging as something greater than the sum of our parts.\nKoch heaved a sigh as he picked up his tablet recorder - \"This doesn't make sense...Four days we've been recording telemetrics here, and my suit's chronometer says it's only been an hour. Something is fucked up.\" We all laughed with our eyebrows raised, seemingly in agreement with this assessment. I helped Capozzi back onto his feet, and looked past him into the distance, a silver capsule perched in a dripping green pasture, glinting under sun rays. \"Let's get back to the ship.\"",

            "about": "Leigh Coleman is a sound-artist residing in Sussex, experimenting with quieter than usual sonic sculpting that follows in the tradition of Francisco Lopez, Richard Chartier and Mika Vainio, among many others grouped into the so-called 'lowercase' movement. Her debut recordings have been distributed only to friends and family since she began working with sound, circulated unceremoniously as files initially, then a small number of nondescript CD-Rs shipped through the mail system with pressed flowers, tea leaves, seeds and other organic ephemera \"dressing\" the discs in clear plastic sleeves.\nOne such disc made its way to our post office box late last year, and made an immediate and distinct impression. The two extended runtime pieces offered here are new compositions, allowed to unfurl across multiple hours each, and were brought into the world after spirited correspondence with Coleman, discussing possibilities and philosophical approaches she had considered, but until now was hesitant to try. Psoma Psi Phi remains not just content, but exuberantly passionate about providing artists such as she a platform to make statements like these. In a world filled with noise, haste and a clamoring towards the efficient and practical, Leigh Coleman seeks to provide a counterpoint of consideration, something that conveys the opposite of these compulsions.\n'The Old Strait Tracks' illustrates a love of the natural world, an appreciation for sound that is not music, and music derived from things other than sound. This sonic world offers a landscape of space, outside of time, awaiting you and only you to step into it and become its subject. Be still, close your eyes, and let it surround you.",

            "about": "'The Road Breaks Apart' was recorded live on November 14th, 2023 using the Moog Subharmonicon analog synthesizer. It is an exploration of polyrhythmic sequencing using just intonation, with subtle augmentation from the R-EW Audioholistics modular system.\nIt hovers in the air like a fog of paranoia, a cloud filled to bursting with worry and dread. It isn't something we can recommend sleeping or meditating to, however, darker tones such as these are immensely useful in the facilitation of other creative endeavors, such as writing, painting and photographic/design work.\nAddressing a number of nonspecific world events currently in motion, 'The Road Breaks Apart' is meant as an acknowledgment of suffering, and an exercise in perhaps the oldest method of creative work: expression of grief, processing pain and attempting to alleviate the mind from being burdened by it.\nIt has always been a chaotic and dark world, and as Winter tightens its grasp, it becomes even darker. It is our sincere hope that this unburdening of emotional weight can be repurposed, transfiguring just a little bit more of the darkness, and thereby functioning as a ladder, even just a short one, leading up and out of the abyss.",

            "about": "Synchronicity is something that may or may not truly exist, but as someone who finds that there can be creative enrichment in seemingly inert information like numbers, dates, symbols and letters, I continually find connections and relationships within otherwise unrelated things. At times, it is something topical and obvious - such as the fiftieth numbered release at Psoma being represented simply as the letter L in Roman numerals - but in other times, it reaches past the surface and communicates with something deeper, which arouses a sense of meaning and purpose, predestination even, beneath the things that I think, say and do.\nThere are two ways to respond to these moments of lucid awareness when and where they occur: The first is to simply shrug it off, and file it away as nothing more than a coincidence, in a sometimes vain effort to convince myself that I am truly in control of my life and situation, that I am not merely following a path set before me by some invisible directive. The second view is that, in a cosmic sense, the universe does not care what I feel about how it operates, that my growth as a human and my explorations as a curious mind both exist in a fixed direction as well as many possible directions, and so there is nothing left to do about it besides trying to rest on a plateau of contented submission.\nIt is through the latter perspective that I often work as a creative person, where my wondering/wandering is able to follow a thread of inquisitive fantasy, so long as I am more or less willing to accept whatever awaits me at the end of this process. These moments of concision, where I am able to draw easy lines from many disparate points to reveal a singular and cogent idea, are made possible by being receptive to the manifestation of a kind of \"push and pull,\" a staircase of steps lit by the occasional number, word or visual symbol that allow me to navigate this apparently endless house.\nAnd so here we are, together again at a junction point where you and I may meet, and I can discuss with you all of the disconnected things that have led me here, feeling as I explain that they are not quite as disconnected as my rational mind would have me believe. I think both the rational and logical side of me can coexist with the side of me that chooses to indulge in the \"What if?\" of tangential creative thinking, that I can simultaneously acknowledge a universe's will guiding me forward, or perhaps \"through\" is a more accurate descriptor, and that I can do so without deifying some aspect of this coming to pass, I can consult the abyss and its so-called randomness as I would use a tool of measurement, a barometer to determine the possible details of a given atmosphere that I find myself approaching.\nAs I understand it, true randomness cannot exist, but instead, systems that are so chaotic that they only appear to be random, because our ape-brains just cannot comprehend math, time, elements or physical spaces at that scale. My work as an artist has reiterated this reality to me again and again, and I am thankful for it, because it has only reinforced the outlook that I suspected much earlier on to be closer to a truth, and at least for myself alone, it is more functionally a truth that I can comprehend and accept: The knowing that life is a state of constant change and learning and forgetting, the acceptance that I will never know everything, and the very outwardly paradoxical observation that the more I learn, the less things I thought I knew make complete sense. I am forever coming from somewhere, on the way to somewhere else, but I am only ever to be where I already am.\n'The Sun' is the first of an open-ended catalogue of work that I conceived in 2021, in the early moments of Limestone Ziggurat's gestation as an idea and functional process. It was the reason, when I opened a Bandcamp page for Limestone Ziggurat, I chose the word 'weltlandschaft' to govern the archive of work that would inevitably fill the digital space, rather than the name of the project itself. This is a German term, which translates to 'world landscape,' and has been a vital part of art and art history for a very long time. Taken historically, it refers to the fantasist landscapes you find behind portraits and central subject matter, artificial but beautiful depth applied to a canvas, until eventually it became a form all on its own, wide frames of impossible perspectives, showing a deeply detailed landscape, the horizon line, perhaps even the sea and the sky and the heavens above it. These works were sometimes created in order to facilitate an escapist moment for the viewer, a massive prosaic scale of the world itself that could rival the plain views offered by windows, even those high up in castle walls.\n'The Sun' is the first of my attempt to align sound - that is, vibration and texture, not specifically musical sound - with any and all elements, locations and events that exist in (or in the view of) our natural world. This is, like the paintings of the old world, a completely prosaic fantasist exercise, and one that (thanks to the modernity of modular synthesis and generative composition) I am able to accomplish without putting myself in the center of. It is the music of the world, as I hear and feel it, my own understanding of the world landscape, which will accumulate over years and eventually become a sort of sonic codex, a map of emotions and frequencies filled in with colors made of shaped and channeled electricity.\nI'd recorded it quite early on in the conception of Limestone Ziggurat, and felt, by way of that gentle nudging from the universe telling me that this thing was not yet ready for publishing, that I should put it aside and explore Limestone Ziggurat in other ways before trying to quantify just what 'The Sun' really meant. Sitting here now, thinking of alignment and synchronicity, seeing connections between this fiftieth Roman numeral and the fact that 'The Sun' consists of exactly fifty oscillators all tuned in perfect overwhelming harmony, I feel somewhat validated in my waiting, knowing now that I have come to the end of this particular path, and all that remains is for me to offer this surreal object to you, and although I can attempt to explain what it has meant to me, and where and how I conceived of excavating it from raw voltages in a cold basement, its identity is justifiably obliterated by its material presence, and whatever 'The Sun' means to you is correct and complete - whether it is merely a painted orange circle on a claustrophobically detailed canvas window, or a doorway to escape from the very real world, when it becomes perhaps too real to bear anymore.\n---\nFor more Limestone Ziggurat recordings, please visit:  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Multidimensional Being singularly defines the BE subcatalog, an open-ended series of releases at Psoma Psi Phi that attempts to organize and arrange both archival recordings and contemporaneous sessions beneath an overarching header. With prior work published here at Psoma (see: Psoma 24  pspsph.bandcamp.com/album/256hz-384hz  ) and Occult Research (see: Annulus, Gateway to Intelligent Infinity), Multidimensional Being seeks to expand the utility of experimental music for both themselves and the listener, and develop an array of synthesized musics that may refer to foundational ideas, designs and recordings in addition to offering alternative, and perhaps profound, perspectives on the physical and emotional aspects of listening.\nForming bridges between technology and humanity, conjuring shapes with electricity and vibration, Multidimensional Being operates and explores a wide range of tools, from many classical synthesis machines to more esoteric devices and outmoded workflows, all of which will be notated here with each recording in the form of patch notes and other relevant information. As time progresses, and the BE catalog expands outwardly in both time and space, it is our sincere desire that these releases are able to enrich the lives of our listeners while also challenging existing notions and assumptions about the relationships between sound design, generative processes and the constructs of musical composition.\nPATCH NOTES (2020/03/??)\n???",

            "about": "Noyzelab is one of several active aliases of David Burraston, a synthesist and sonic tinkerer with far too many references to list. All you need to know is that Burraston explores possibilities in not just sound, but also programming, mathematics and nature. His work has taken him all over the world, to do workshops, residencies and mentorships with everyone from Richard D. James to Chris Watson, and led him to issue his recordings with such imprints as Important Records, Taiga and MEDS, among many others.\nHe has graciously agreed to issue some of (what we consider) his very best work at Psoma Psi Phi, and for this occasion, we have furnished Burraston with his very own subcatalog at the label, simply titled NYZ. NYZ releases will exist on both cassette and CD-R formats, depending on the recordings in question, and will be fairly limited physical affairs in conjunction with open editions of \"abridged\" digital versions. This allows everyone to familiarize themselves with Burraston's work freely, while also rewarding those who support the imprint (by purchasing physical media) with additional and unedited content.\nFor NYZ-I, Burraston gives us TTMSubtree, a 90-minute cassette of wavering tones that shift in and out of focus, playing the frequency spectrum like a sedate keyboard. Over time, these tones gradually grow and recede in their individual voices, overlapping to produce alien forms inside the drone. Aspects of the release become more isolated and still as the recordings play forward, with moments that even sound like metal bells hanging on a telephone wire in an abandoned town, softly blown against each other by the wind. The final 35-minute closing piece is perhaps the most striking of all - a warm gusting breath of a glossy chordal tone, forever cycling through a barely decaying orbit...omnipresent and yet completely abandoned in the same instance.\nTTMSubtree is a stunning debut release for Psoma Psi Phi, and truly we are honored to have Burraston issuing his work with us. For newcomers, Burraston's work here is recommended for fans of Eliane Radigue, Eleh, Mika Vainio, Richard Chartier and others of their ilk.\nUPDATE 2018.03.04: The 2xCD-R reissue is now stocked at Norman Records in the UK  www.normanrecords.com/records/169773-noyzelab-ttmsubtree\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "David Burraston returns to Psoma Psi Phi with his fifth release for the label, and third bearing the Noyzelab moniker. Water Cell Meditations is the second of a five-part series that will be issued serially between October 2018 and February 2019.\nThe recordings presented here are, as the title implies, intended to assist in meditation, and operate as minimalistic walls of humming drones, parsed out into pre-determined \"dosages\", to assist in their usage as a utility. Only have three minutes before you have to go to work? There's a 3-minute Cell Meditation for you here. Need a harmonic backdrop for your yoga session or your power nap? Cell Meditations also come in 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30-minute sections. For those of you seeking a deeper experience, Burraston has also provided 45 and 60-minute versions of these Meditations, perfect for disconnection, introspection and all manner of subconscious stimulation. As is his usual, Burraston's work treats time itself as an elastic band that passes by at a rate of his choosing, and for this we've come to be quite addicted to these recordings, even finding ourselves lost inside a three-minute drone. In this fashion, Noyzelab has essentially created an infinite generative structure, and these segments are in fact windows of varying lengths of time, through which we're able to observe and experience something that is impossibly large and unfathomably deep. Be careful with these Meditations - even the artist himself has issued a text advisory in the notes for these recordings - for they are potent and finely distilled examples of the current the universe itself moves through, from element to element.\nNOTE: The digital version of NYZ-V contains only the 20-minute Meditation. For the full and unabridged Water Cell Meditations experience, listeners may purchase the limited edition 3xCD-R set.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs.

            "about": "An unexpected album that materialized from session recordings for the Milieu album Elide (  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/elide  ), transmuting late Summer evenings in the White Pillar Workshop into sonic seasoning and sub-bass balm. Having the studio half underground, and half on the precipice of a steep ravine brings with it a sense of being surrounded by Earth and nature. Trees filled sometimes with the rushing valley wind, and others, with blue hour skies and fireflies...but always, a sensation of being deep inside something. The Workshop drones on, ever pulsing with analog waves and echoes of distant ocean shores, lapping on empty beaches. The fantasy of escapism, ripe for the claiming, to be explored night after night, moment to moment, like pages in a sedative book.",

            "about": "WINDBLOWN ECLOGUES is a classically inspired piece of digital ambient music created using a video game - specifically the ByteBeat digital audio workstation implemented in No Man's Sky, a procedurally generated space exploration game developed by Hello Games.\nTaking influence from Synergy's Computer Experiments album from 1980 and the two excellent Jochem Paap records issued at FAX in 1999, ECLOGUES illustrates a vibrant and surreal soundworld that, for the production of the session, was played back in realtime within No Man's Sky itself. Subtle elemental sounds come and go throughout the piece, which are the sounds of the planetary environment where the ByteBeat machines were placed to generate the sound - a paradise planet with red grass and green seas named Thansmonten, found in the Anspol system, where a cozy workshop base made out of dark wood and glass sits atop a peak, accessible only by ship.\nECLOGUES has been designed with these images in mind, and is intended as listening material for the purposes of reading (vintage science-fiction paperbacks, especially), stargazing and finally (hopefully) lucid dreaming. It is a paean to many different inspirations, from Wendy Carlos to Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke to Chris Foss, Alvin Lucier to Boris Vallejo, Sagan, Bocklin, Sage, Dolan and many others that informed trajectories of the mind, and the philosophies of space, and vice-versa.",

            "about": "Saito Koji is a prolific musician currently residing in Fukushima, Japan, who comes to Ps√∏ma with an album of two extended ambient pieces titled Winter Journal. These pieces, like Archive Deleter by Kazuya Ishigami, somewhat feel like more classic ambient recordings did in the early 2000s, especially the untitled-sides of tapes coming out of communities in New Zealand, San Francisco and Los Angeles. At first, Koji's sound seems informed by a guitar, but as it progresses forward and downward, it becomes harder to pinpoint what the sonic provenance is.\nWinter Journal consists of two 21-minute recordings, \"Fukashigi\" and \"Fuyu No Seiza\", which slowly fill up like the foggy craters of a primordial Earth, dowsed in rain and wind for eons, the stuff of life (as Sagan would say) bubbling up from beneath the turbulence, crawling toward the surface from a dark and calm abyss. After a while, these pieces almost give the impression of an orchestra tuning up in extreme slow motion, thin lines of tone emerging from the din that gradually settle into a singing harmony, before parting to the side so another such sound may come forward.\nAltogether, Winter Journal is a welcome addition to the growing Ps√∏ma catalog, and feels so classically informed that it already invokes a peculiar sense of familiarity, and with that, comfort. It plays out like a beckoning beacon in a snowstorm that warms your spirits and assures you that respite is almost here.",

            "about": "David Burraston returns to Psoma Psi Phi with his eighth release for the label, and sixth bearing the Noyzelab moniker. Wood Cell Meditations is the fifth and final installment of a five-part series that was issued serially between October 2018 and February 2019.\nThe recordings presented here are, as the title implies, intended to assist in meditation, and operate as minimalistic walls of humming drones, parsed out into pre-determined \"dosages\", to assist in their usage as a utility. Only have three minutes before you have to go to work? There's a 3-minute Cell Meditation for you here. Need a harmonic backdrop for your yoga session or your power nap? Cell Meditations also come in 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30-minute sections. For those of you seeking a deeper experience, Burraston has also provided 45 and 60-minute versions of these Meditations, perfect for disconnection, introspection and all manner of subconscious stimulation. As is his usual, Burraston's work treats time itself as an elastic band that passes by at a rate of his choosing, and for this we've come to be quite addicted to these recordings, even finding ourselves lost inside a three-minute drone. In this fashion, Noyzelab has essentially created an infinite generative structure, and these segments are in fact windows of varying lengths of time, through which we're able to observe and experience something that is impossibly large and unfathomably deep. Be careful with these Meditations - even the artist himself has issued a text advisory in the notes for these recordings - for they are potent and finely distilled examples of the current the universe itself moves through, from element to element.\nNOTE: The digital version of NYZ-VIII contains only the 20-minute Meditation. For the full and unabridged Wood Cell Meditations experience, listeners may purchase the limited edition 3xCD-R set.\nNOTE: After some confusion from listeners, we'd like to make clear the fact that all NYZ/Noyzelab catalog releases at Psoma are available ONLY as abridged digital versions for name-your-price/free download, and in their full unabridged editions as physical CD-Rs. There is not an unabridged digital version of anything from NYZ at Psoma, and the physical editions do not ship with unabridged digital versions either (that is, if you do not count the digital music present on the compact discs). For listeners only interested in unabridged digital versions, we encourage you to visit  noyzelab.bandcamp.com  to purchase those directly from NYZ, or even better, subscribe to his Bandcamp output and just get everything.",

            "about": "OCR's third release at P/Psi/P bears only the simple designation of Y. Appropriately, Y is a triple-album set, echoing both the catalog number and the physical shape of its monogrammed namesake.\nY is a junction point, a confluence of three rivers flowing inward toward each other from the northwest, northeast and deep south. Individual tracks exist to indicate starting coordinates, latitude and longitude encoded as aural ciphers. At it's centre, a quiet village sits - imperceptibly awash with the tones of the day, a windy harmony of three disparate provenances. Unmapped and unnamed, it consists of six stone structures, weathered down to seamless surfaces via uncounted centuries of humidity. The improbable waters form a moat around the buildings, where clocks no longer work correctly, and daylight is abbreviated between nights that seem endless. A fountain, spare and unadorned, in the shape of a circle with a triangle inside, pools with a still blue fluid in the middle of the small settlement. In sunlight, it seems inert and shallow, but as night falls, a faint fluorescence begins to manifest, alongside beckoning depths of black below the gentle surface. Truly, this place calls to wanderers and seekers, in a swirling voice that is not made of sound or vibration, but memory and temperature. This sleeping micro-isle, built by a people whose names have been eroded away long ago, and could never be pronounced now in any common tongue. Your directions have been given, the stars fixed, the beam aligned and the past ground down into the dusty paths you'll now follow. You always have, you always are and you always will.",
