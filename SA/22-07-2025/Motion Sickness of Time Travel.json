            "about": "Edition of 50 CDs on Adversary:\nadversaryelectronics(dot)bigcartel(dot)com\n\"Affinity\" is the first new Motion Sickness of Time Travel material recorded since the birth of our son. Book-ended by a prologue and epilogue, the album is structured in such a way as to introduce three \"character studies\", followed by an extended interlude and finally, at the core, a revisitation and intermingling of the three characters. Featuring some of Rachel's darkest and most hard-edged work to date, especially on tracks like New Moon and Ternion, \"Affinity\" is a welcome return and a slight departure from past offerings.",

            "about": "C44 (HIV137)  hookervision.blogspot.com\nWith Alpha Piscium, Rachel Evans returns to the cassette format after nearly a year’s worth of monthly, self-released compact discs. The music on Alpha Piscium was mostly recorded in spring of 2013 but was left to ferment for a year while Evans continued work on her ongoing, monthly CD series. Dense, ever-changing, flirting occasionally with darker textures, the pixelated landscape conjured on Alpha Piscium represents the high point of Rachel’s recorded work. Intended as a proper followup to the widely acclaimed self titled release, Alpha Piscium finds Rachel further refining and expanding her sonic palette while not loosing sight of her, by now, signature sound.\nRecorded at home by Rachel Evans; synthesizer, electronics and voice. Artwork by Grant Evans; pro-dubbed edition of 100 tapes, covers printed on heavy shimmer paper.",

            "about": "Physical release of 6 x CS Box + 2015 lunar calendar/poster + download (HIV1142, edition of 100) SOLD OUT\nOptional purchase of lunar calendar/poster + digital release\n(limited to 20)\nDigital release includes download of all 12 + PDF of lunar calendar/poster (unlimited)\nIn September 2013, Rachel Evans committed to recording and releasing an album per month, each dedicated to the full moon of that particular month. Each album consists of one single, long-form composition using electronics, synthesizers and voice, totaling between 50 and 58 minutes in duration. The album names were taken from the Native American names for each month's full moon, and each was released as close to or on the date of that month's full moon. The albums were originally self-released in hand-numbered editions of 50 Cdrs, with each season (or set of three) having a different design and packaging scheme. In August of 2014 Rachel concluded and released the final recording. Beginning on September 9, 2014 pre-orders will become available for the six tape box set edition of these albums, which will include all twelve Ballades, one per side. Due to the limited capacity of cassettes for this version, three of the compositions have been trimmed so that no side exceeds 55 minutes. Even so, the full duration of this box set's audio is 10 hours and 37 minutes. Editions include six pro-dubbed and imprinted cassettes, housed in an oversized plastic box, with a two-sided 2015 lunar calendar designed by Rachel Evans. Edition of 100.",

Befitting the format, the sounds are bright, retro-futuristic; the future as it might have been, glanced in a brief flash. However cursory this glance is, it doesn't feel hasty. On the contrary, there are a mosaic of layers at play and once the flash has faded, the impressions remain.\nCalculating moves in the dark. Fleeting feelings linger.

After unceremoniously dismantling the Hooker Vision empire in 2014, Rachel and Grant Evans continued their near-obsessive mission of creating homespun sounds and visuals, the likes of which began leaking out into the world in that heady spring of 2008 when the label first began. Now, 13 years after the first Hooker Vision release, in the final months of 2021, the duo have rebooted the label. Much like the earliest Hooker Vision releases, this cassette is released in an impossibly limited run of 22 home-dubbed cassettes featuring the type of collage work often associated with the halcyon days of the label. With no direction in mind, we find the couple in yet another transitional period: seeking yet relaxed, inquisitive but comfortable.\nFollowing the organic dissolution of the Modern Lamps collective in 2010, the band seemed destined to remain a side note to the early days of the Hooker Vision label. After a decade of dormancy, the project returns (on this outing as a solo vehicle for co-founder and multi-instrumentalist Grant Evans) with a 45-minute missive of cosmic transcendence. Beginning with a nod to \"Interstellar Space\", the piece opens with the solitary ringing of sleighbells. From there, the listener is sent on a hypnotic journey, carried by winds of synth, guitar, strummed piano, and percussion.\nIn contrast to the mercurial shapeshifting of her husband, Rachel Evans has remained steadfastly consistent with her solo project, Motion Sickness of Time Travel, since 2009. The past year, however, has seen Rachel looking back to her roots in songwriting, even going so far as to record new versions of songs she wrote in her late teens. While most well-known for her long-form drones, Motion Sickness of Time Travel set itself apart from similar acts by utilizing Rachel's unmistakable vocals and her keen ear for songcraft. We now find Rachel searching for a way to combine her confessional songwriting with her otherworldly synth work.\nThis release is moving in two directions at the same time: looking toward the future while reimagining the past.",

            "about": "\"Diaries & Documents: 2006-2010\" is split into two collections of early recordings.\nThe first tape, \"Diaries\", is made up of Rachel's earliest sound experiments as she began introducing electronic elements into her music, eventually taking on the Motion Sickness of Time Travel moniker. The pieces range from under 2 minutes to nearly 20 and date from 2006 to 2009. Sound sources include drums, field recordings, guitars, pianos, synthesizers, and voice.\nThe second tape, \"Documents\", are all live performance recordings ranging from 2008 to 2010. Side A includes three highly composed performances using either Pure Data or Max patches to generate, effect and sequence sounds. Side B features 4 improvised concerts using combinations of computer patches, synthesizers and vocals.\nProfessionally duplicated tapes.\n2x c50, edition of 100.\n(Adversary no. 17)",

Her instantly recognisable arpeggiated mood music is bound to take you on a mental trip. For this new cassette, Dreamcatcher smoothly glides into the unconscious and opens doors to next level dreaming.\" - Hobo Cult\n\"Rachel Evans spoils us with an ultra-limited and utterly breathtaking transmission for the Hobo Cult label. Frankly, this is some of her most gorgeous material to date, so deeply layered you could happily fall head-first for daze and not hit the bottom, but also arranged with a pop-neat sensibility keeping most tracks below the five minute mark. This is a really special release.\" - Boomkat\n200 copies / Pro-dubbed & printed clear blue shells with white ink. Cover art printed onto beige heavy-stock paper\nhobocult.blogspot.com/2011/08/msott-dreamcatcher.html",

            "about": "The song \"Green Carpet\" was written in 2006 and tells the story of meeting the person that would spend the next 15 years and counting with. The 2007 original version is also one of the first recordings I began experimenting with other techniques, styles and sounds on. In 2010 I began weaving aspects of my 2006 and 2007 recordings into small cassette tape releases, reworking them into something new and moving towards almost solely using synthesizers. Now, in 2021, I find myself coming back to songwriting, reminiscing through the lyrics, and pushing the limits of that experimentation that awakened my ears and mind through this track over ten years ago.\n2021 version recorded 9/23 with cello, synthesizers (Korg Kaossilator, Korg Monologue, Music From Outer Space Sound Lab Analog Synth Box, Teenage Engineering PO-14 Sub Bass and PO-12 Rythm), and voice.",

            "about": "\"If we opened people up, we'd find landscapes.\" - Agnès Varda\nWhat we see or hear is only the surface. A passing reflection in the mirror; a snapshot taken with a Polaroid camera. Poetry perhaps, or maybe short stories, depending on the angle. But within each of us is a dense, convoluted series of chapters; a novel with multiple perspectives, yet somehow all about the same character. Beneath the surface are layers upon layers of lost memories, all of the feelings we've ever felt, and all of the thoughts we've ever thought, all of the dreams we've ever dreamed. These aspects of ourselves, usually buried deep within, are like landscape paintings. What if we revealed our inner landscapes?\nInstrumentation on \"Self Portrait In Decay\" includes: cello, synthesizers, guitar, wind chimes, xylophone, concertina, piano, voice, violin, drum machine, and snare drum. Instrumentation on \"Your Layered Silhouette Unwinding\" includes: cello, piano, software woodwinds, synthesizers, software strings, rhodes, xylophone. Composed June 2021 by Rachel Evans.",

            "about": "LP & CD (edition of 750? pink vinyl)\nCD available separately (edition unknown)\nDigitalis: DIGIV059\n\"Limited first vinyl pressing, comes on coloured vinyl and also Includes a CD copy of the album that features two extra tracks not on the vinyl. Rachel Evans left many listeners stunned with her debut album 'Seeping Through The Veil Of The Unconscious', released on tape and vinyl to pretty much universal acclaim at the end of last year. Her follow-up proper, 'Luminaries & Synastry' is a divine, subtly dizzying descent from the heights of that album, catching Rachel cocooned in a feather-like freefall to more pastoral climes without ever actually touching down to solid ground. The simplicity of instinctively layered, ethereal vocals and seemingly infinite arpeggios make for a mesmerising take on pop music, where the atmospheric composition contains far more nitrous oxide in a lower pressure system, and duly everyone floats about dazed in a state of post-rave/orgasmic bliss. This suspended sensation is unmistakable on opener 'Luminaries', those whispered vocals condensing around beads of glinting machine rhythms and convective synth swirls, precipitating the mood of things to come. Following this, 'Synastry' provides a poignant moment of clarity where you can almost make out whole phrases through the pillow of gaseous drones, slowing the systolic rate for the twilight glide of 'Late Day Sun Silhouettes' and the lambent organ glow of 'Ascendant' or 'Athame'. Entering the kosmische vortex of 'Day Glow' and ''Moving Backward Through The Constellations' the mood turns less blissed and more viscerally tactile, where creeping arpeggios envelope Rachel's haloed vocal in a tangle of bittersweet dissonance, before the gaseous glades of 'Eight Nineteen' opens out, eyelids fluttering, to the scenery of 'The Walls Were Dripping With Stars'. The LP features artwork by Hobo Cult's Frank Ouelette, mastering by Brad Rose and a cut by D&M, the first pressing of the last album sold out in less than a week so check in early.

            "about": "“The first time I called myself a 'Witch' was the most magical moment of my life... dare to look within yourself and you are a Witch.\" - M. Adler\n\"Underneath it all is an appreciation of nature.\" - Kenneth Anger\nThis 2-disc set of recordings includes 10 new compositions, one never physically released track (Totality) plus 5 favorites together in a single collection. With the right intentions one or more of these works can serve as aids down your own path of study, discovery, practice, and enlightenment.\n______________________\nThe first version of this special compilation was a limited 2-disc edition of hand-stamped discs in white DVD cases with cardstock collage insert. It came with pouches of magickal objects and a booklet with instructions for various crafting (like weaving, spellwork, and more). It was released in May of 2019.\nThe second version of this compilation is a made to order edition with each disc housed in a separate jewel case. New collage art created in June of 2021was cropped in half and used to give each volume's cover an equal portion of the image. Covers removed from the jewel cases line up to form the complete collage image for this second edition, released in celebration of Summer Solstice 2021.",

            "about": "Motion Sickness of Time Travel\n\"s/t\" 2xLP\neditionsmego.com/release/SP+016\nEdition of 1000 (300 clear-blue vinyl, 700 black)\n\"In 2010 Rachel Evans released \"Seeping Through the Veil of the Unconscious\", an expansive, magic trick of a cassette which captivated an unsuspecting American cassette underground and made dedicated fans instantly. Digitalis released fine editions of the \"Seeping...\" as well as the acclaimed follow-up \"Luminaries and Synastries\" on LP which packed an equally potent punch. Since then much anticipation has been created from her work with husband Grant Evans, including a split LP on Aguirre Records in late 2011 and various releases as duo Quiet Evenings.\nEvans has since been hard at work on an expansive, definitive 2xLP project, carefully arranging sounds to create immense, alchemical side-long tracks which push the boundries of the project into new territory. These incredible new highs are documented in a clear, spacious fidelity where cerebral sounds gently flow and wash through the stereo field creating a beautiful deep listening situation. Big changes in sound and scope are evident; a shift from the murky, mysterious haze of the older recordings into a highly addictive concentrate of airy tones and gem-like glow, each track forming a universal sky-map . There is, however, no loss of mystique. One of Evans most charming elements is her ability to create a divine magnetism, and to capture this very magic unfiltered, raw and uncomprimised. Very few have the capability to create this powerful energy and make is as accessible as Evans does.\nThis full-length definitive album is a high water mark in Motion Sickness of Time Travel discography. An album masterfully crafted with ambition, crystal clear vision and dedicated focus. Mastered for vinyl by Lawrence English and cut for vinyl at Dubplates and Mastering.\nArtwork by Juli Elin Toro\"",

Since we last heard from her on the label with her split with Tidal, Motion Sickness of Time Travel's Rachel Evans has delved a bit further into abstract territory with each new release. Her material on this split continues along the course of expanding her singular sound, with Evans layering spaced out synth improvisations over soothing pads while her gentle vocals seep into the mix like a beautiful apparition. Since we heard from them last, Imperial Topaz underwent a slight line up change and ditched the guitar in the process. Here, Caroline Teagle and newcomer Zachary Zierden cruise far away from the sun-drenched tunes that defined the project's debut in favor of cold, pulsing synth pop. Thumping rhythms accompany neon-lit progressions while Teagle's commanding voice sings evocative stories of souls lost in the twilight. Pro-dubbed and imprinted chrome cassettes, featuring designs by Caroline Teagle.\"\ntranquilitytapes.blogspot.com\nimperialtopaz.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Split tape with Tidal.\nTranquility Tapes, TQ11\n(1st edition 100, 2nd edition 50)\n\"Here, two rapidly blossoming projects from both sides of the Atlantic present deep, complimentary reflections on ethereal beauty. Georgia's Rachel Evans (Quiet Evenings) kicks off the affair via her Motion Sickness of Time Travel project and four distinct ambient pop gems. Synth swells and arpeggios cascade across the ears, while Evans' bewitching voice seeps in like an apparition on the horizon, only to disappear and leave its memory coursing through your veins. Under his Tidal alias, Brighton's Jimmy Billingham continues with three haunting synth pieces. Thoroughly washed out melodies laced with feedback conjure up a dense grey atmosphere, yet an unmistakable warmth radiates from the center of each track. Pro-dubbed and imprinted chrome cassettes, featuring designs by Caroline Teagle.\"\ntranquilitytapes.blogspot.com\nGet Tidal's half here:\ntidal.bandcamp.com",

The woozy opener, 'Before Dawn' sets the late night mood as a throbbing pulse emerges, heartbeat-like, about midway through. The B side, 'After Dark', plays like a shy mirror twin to 'Before Dawn'. Picking up the crumbs left by the A side, 'After Dark' settles into a nocturnal drone, building to a strikingly understated crescendo.\nBegins shipping in early April.\nReleased on Hooker Vision:  hookervision.bandcamp.com/album/no-domino",

            "about": "Inspired by my own tarot readings, track 1 represents a three-card spread. It was an accidental reading which presented itself to me at a significant time in my life. It led me down a path of further study with tarot in which I drew a card a day and eventually decided to craft my own deck. The more I have discovered and uncovered the potential of tarot and their meanings the more their archetypes have come to embody certain individuals in my life. Tracks 2 through 4 are dedicated to these three people. This download is available for a limited time alongside my printed set of tarot, The Oddments.",

            "about": "In 2020 I began writing more lyrical songs again. 10 tracks are in various states of completion. This short single shares three of these works, including two mixes of the new song “Our City”. Several tracks from the larger set of pieces are actually revised and re-recorded songs that I originally wrote as early as 2006. Later in 2021 the complete set will be released all recorded in 2020 and mixed in 2021.\nThis set of tracks is in celebration of 15 years of Valentine's Days with my other half. Here's to the city where we met and fell in love; a strange and magical place where we created so many memories together.",

Featuring a mix of new songs and songs written over a decade ago, \"Ouroboros\" is, at once, both forward-thinking and unapologetically nostalgic. While, instrumentally, this collection still leans heavily on abstract textures, drones, and pulses, Rachel's once-indecipherable vocals are now more or less intelligible. There are definite earworms lurking just below the surface. Call it subliminal pop.",

Despite acertain warmth and delicate intimacy there’s a more austere and creepy atmosphere rooted in discomfort that is dominant on „Oust“.\"\nElectronics, Synthesizer and Voice by Rachel Evans.\nRecorded at home, December 2012\nEdition of 130.",

Edition of 100 pro-dubbed chrome tapes with risograph artwork designed by L. Noble.\" - No Kings\nBoth tracks recorded live on October 31, 2012; electronics, synthesizers and voice.",

The LP re-issues have a different track order and have been remastered for vinyl by Brad Rose.\nYou can purchase the mastered (vinyl-version) tracks from Boomkat here:  boomkat.com/downloads/400391-motion-sickness-of-time-travel-seeping-through-the-veil-of-the-unconscious\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nCassette (edition of 80)\nDigitalis Ltd. (ltd154)\nLP re-issue (limited vinyl edition, 200 green/300 black)\nDigitalis (digiv032)\nLP 2nd pressing (500 white vinyl)\nDigitalis (digiv032)\n\"*Initial copies come on ultra-limited green vinyl. Beautiful layered vocals and electronics - a must for fans of Grouper.* Sublime temporal intervention of fragile drone pop from Motion Sickness Of Time Travel, the solo alias of Hooker Vision co-curator, Rachel Evans. Between graduating from college and starting grad school last year she committed these five tracks onto a cassette for Digitalis which has since been remastered onto emerald green vinyl by Brad Rose, who hailed the album as \"the best demo I've ever received\" - and it's really easy to believe him. 'Seeping Through The Veil of the Unconscious' finds Evans' individual sound suspended like a time-lapsed image of Grouper's angelic reveries or a more minimal, gaseous take on the sound made by Stellar Om Source. This is the sort of music you inhale with your ears, catching its subtly harmonised notes in your pleasure centres like some tingling rare space gas. Gazing out into the twinkling slow synth haemorrhage 'Clairvoyance', wordless vocals drift by like space dust on an endless cosmic voyage, while 'Mental Projection' is laced with the same kind of after-hours substance that informed the finest post-Detroit UK electronica. However, the album's guiding star has to be the radiant 'Telepathy', a heart-stopping late night lullaby of half-heard vocal fragrances redolent of Altar Eagle albeit within a darkly rhythmic and strange 3D sound sphere. The detailed crevices and dense pop essence of this album takes everything she's done before to incredible new heights, hence our highest recommendation for lovers of midnight electronic romance.\" -boomkat\n------- Links ------\nCassette (Digitalis Ltd.):\nwww.digitalisindustries.com/ltd154.html\nLP (Digitalis):\ndigitalisindustries.com/digiv032.html\nLP (Boomkat):\nboomkat.com/vinyl/372855-motion-sickness-of-time-travel-seeping-through-the-veil-of-the-unconscious-limited-vinyl-edition\nLP 2nd Pressing (Boomkat):\nboomkat.com/vinyl/397152-motion-sickness-of-time-travel-seeping-through-the-veil-of-the-unconscious-white-vinyl-edition",

Slow Architecture seeks out the empty corners of the psyche and builds its towering steeples of noise therein. This set of two pro-dubbed, imprinted cassettes is limited to 100 copies. Packaged together in a clear cassette album.\"\n-SLG\nGet the other half of this split here:\nnovascotianarms.bandcamp.com/album/slow-architecture\nsweatlodgeguru.com/200-2/",

The waves pass through each other without being disturbed. The net displacement of the medium at any point in space or time, is simply the sum of the individual wave displacements.\"",

Cut-up, reversed, and wordless phrases spiral out of building sequences. Distant voices fade before they can be deciphered. A comet far away watches its meteor children shower the sky. The celestial mechanics of the macro are driving the micro frequencies. Periodic repetitions accumulate as a programmed rhythm falls into sync. Something visceral is being projected and looped via soundwaves.\nProfessionally duplicated tapes. Comes with download.\nEdition of 40. (Adversary no. 32)",

Whether the terms of music here is ambiguous but personal voice, the electronic as modernist tool for folk-making, or a magic-realist or urban-pastoral perspective- these terms are expanding in ways that are gaseous; the terrestrial reaching out to the more intangible worlds of dream and space. This is individual and private music speaking to a more collective conscious. This is Taxidermy of Unicorns- an act of stuffing such a mythical animal, fabricating this beautiful beast as a specimen of all such beasts...\"\nwaterystarve.blogspot.com\naloonaluna.bandcamp.com\njesuislepetitchevalier.bandcamp.com\nbirdsofpassage.bandcamp.com",

In 2010 Rachel's computer music and theory mentor, composer Mitchell Turner, remixed the stems for her first self-released CD (prior to adopting the moniker Motion Sickness of Time Travel). In 2020 Rachel re-recorded an acoustic version while revisiting these old compositions.\nThe collage is a cropped version of a 17 x 20 piece created by Rachel in 2011.\nDigital Download Only.\nFor more of Mitch's music, check out  ctatsu.bandcamp.com/album/cascade  and  hookervision.bandcamp.com/album/c-lestes-rivages",

That Wheel was made of water, but also of fire, and it was (although the edge could be seen) infinite. Interlinked, all things that are, were and shall be formed it, and I was one of the fibers of that total fabric and Pedro de Alvarado who tortured me was another. There lay revealed the causes and the effects and it sufficed me to see that Wheel in order to understand it all, without end. O bliss of understanding, greater than the bliss of imagining or feeling. I saw the universe and I saw the intimate designs of the universe. I saw the origins narrated in the Book of the Common. I saw the mountains that rose out of the water, I saw the first men of wood, the cisterns that turned against the men, the dogs that ravaged their faces. I saw the faceless god concealed behind the other gods. I saw infinite processes that formed one single felicity and, understanding all, I was able also to understand the script of the tiger.\"\n-Jorge Luis Borges\nGet the other half of the split here:\nnovascotianarms.bandcamp.com/album/the-fire-cult-to-your-dream-child\nhookervision.blogspot.com/2010/09/autumn-batch.html",

'The Perennials' is Rachel Evans' eagerly awaited follow-up to that eponymous LP for Spectrum Spools, channelling her celestial energies into concise and emotive ambient-pop arrangements on the cusp of progressive '90s trance. Taking in a handful of gorgeous songs ranging from pastoral instrumentals to strobing arpeggio surfers and sweeping mini bleep symphonies, she isolates a feeling or vibe hovering between the alien horizons of Tangerine Dream and Laurie Spiegel and the heart-aching cinematic yearn of Angelo Badalamenti and Julee Cruise at their best for David Lynch. From the icarus-like trance ascension of opener 'Efflorescence', she makes a deeply endearing virtue of divining unresolved tension between cosmic ambition and lo-fi willpower, defying its teasing gravity to ride pockets of thermal energy with siren-like chicanery on the radiant 'The Reynard And The Vixen', whilst the neo-tantrik positivism of 'Foggy Morning' consolidates the compatible dimensions of Laurel Halo and Suzanne Ciani with bittersweet effect beside the lushly heightened sensuality of 'The Chord and the Centre'. Ultimately it's as close as we've seen MSOTT get to the dancefloor, a direction we reckon she should continue to explore.\" - Boomkat",

            "about": "This album was released as HV25 on Hooker Vision as a cassette\nedition of 15. For more info visit:  hookervision.bandcamp.com/album/the-rabbit-and-the-hawk\nIn 2021 Rachel embarked on recordings, sketches, and compositions that would eventually culminate in her first film score for the independent film An Evening Song (for Three Voices), written and directed by Graham Swon. Works that went into the score included portions of If We Were Landscapes and No Domino. With a full score still forthcoming in collaboration with Swon and the distribution of the film, Rachel releases this set of compositions recorded in January and February 2023 that served as themes for specific scenes and character portraits for the three individuals. Like the film, the lines between each person blur (both visually and as the narrative progresses). An undercurrent of something unsettling is afoot in this period piece. In the end, one of the three voices disappears. On this particular set of recordings, Rachel limited her instrumentation to electric piano, voice, cello, and synthesizer.\nThe film's official synopsis: 1939, in the Midwest: an impeded author, her pulp-writer husband, and their pious maid. A spellbinding plunge into their intertwined thoughts, memories, and visions.\nWatch the film's trailer:  youtu.be/ibIYWGSbRNg?feature=shared\nRead Screenslate's review leading up to the Museum of Moving Images premiere:  www.screenslate.com/articles/evening-song-three-voices",

Recordings featured in Movement I include the earliest sets of collaborations with Leslie Grove, captured between 2013-14. Leslie on chimes, bowed cymbals, and assorted effected percussion. Rachel on a variety of synthesizers. Movement II is a remastered version of a live sound bath captured at sunrise and broadcast by Rachel in 2020 with a singing bowl, bells, and gentle vocals. Movement III follows, fading into another solo effort named after the act of forest bathing and remastered from the digital-only original version. Finally, Movement IV sees Rachel and Leslie joining forces a second time to close out this set of performances, interweaving natural and electronic drones of sustained chord organ and synthesizer to envelope the listener in a heavy-weighted cocoon.\nGet lost in this. Go for a walk into this sound. The album is the forest.",

            "about": "Released on A Guide to Saints, cassette + digital\nroom40.org/motion_sickness_sntone\nCassette Diaries is a series of momentary musics -recordings made in short periods of times - be that a day, a week or a little bit more. Each edition is hand assembled, hand sprayed and hand screen printed by the fine folks at 7th Disaster.\nRachel Evans’ Motion Sickness Of Time Travel is the perfect starting point for Cassette Diaries. Much of her work is created in the moment, her layers of pulsing synth, textured electronics and phasing vocal sways are often recorded in one live take. Weeks, sometimes months, of preparation are executed and documented in the moment. On Traces, she marks out a diverse and overtly rich sonic tapestry that interlocks and breaks apart with an elegant sense of fluidity. We couldn't be more pleased to have this as our departure point.",

Originally released on the now defunct Hooker Vision imprint, each was composed and recorded between 2010 and 2012: \"The Sound of Reality Dissolving\", \"Red Tide\", and \"The Cirque\". Together they symbolize the crux of the emerging Motion Sickness of Time Travel signature sounds: lush effected vocals, computer-manipulated electronics, and an array of synthesizer washes and drones.",

            "about": "Split cassette with Listening Mirror.\nBathetic 49.\nbatheticrecords.com\nbatheticrecords.com/motion_sickness_of_time_travel_and_listening_mirror/\nBathetic is pleased to bring this limited edition split cassette from two wonderful up and comers in the realm of beautiful ambient soundcape music; Rachel Evans' Motion Sickness Of Time Travel & Jeff Stonehouse's Listening Mirror.\nThis comes hot off the heels of Bathetic's initial Listening Mirror release, the breathtaking The Heart Of The Sky.\nMotion Sickness Of Time Travel has been steadily builiding a name for itself, as Rachel Evans creates absolutely dream-like fields of musical texture. Recalling, vaguely the likes of Grouper or Sparkling Wide Pressure, Evans submits long, shimmering pieces that travel from concrete droning tone to heavenly, dense reverb-bliss. Shaking the dirt loose from the folds of your hands. This is heavy, heavy, heavy; in the purest, most blinding way.\nListening Mirror is becoming another name to follow, as Jeff Stonehouse keeps bringing the most intimate ambient music to our ears. For this split, we're set to the skies with long-reaching synth sweeps and a beautiful backdrop of bassy drone. Soon, voices emerge, the sky becomes thick and heavy. Glorious, bright, and intense. This is not background music. Crank it and find yourself worshipping the sun, the stars, and reaching towards the heavens.\nEdition of 100.\nGet the other half of this split here:\nlistening-mirror.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Cassette, edition of 200\n(Digitalis, DIGI059X)\ndigitalisindustries.com/digi059x.html\n\"during the last few months of 2010, rachel evans & i sent a lot of ideas and thoughts back & forth via email in an effort to create something truly special with her \"luminaries & synastry\" album. rachel worked on and recorded so much incredible music during that period that it became a major undertaking in-and-of itself to pare down everything she'd recorded into a single, stellar 45 minute document. after weeks of deliberation, we settled on a tracklist. the problem, then, was that there were so many other fantastic pieces of music that didn't make the cut. so we put our heads together again and came up with the idea of doing a companion tape that included the best of those outtakes plus two tracks from the very-limited/impossible to find \"sistrum\" 3\" CDR. with that i give you \"white candle.\" - Digitalis\n\"We shouldn't need to remind you that MSOTT aka Rachel Evans has owned our listening habits over the last year with a string of divine releases on the likes of Digitalis and Hooker Vision. The latest, 'White Candle' is essentially a collection of outtakes from one of her most cherished LPs, 'Luminaries & Synastries' coupled with two tracks from her impossible-to-find 'Sistrum' 3\" CDr. It came about as she and Digitalis boss Brad Rose realised that it would be a huge shame to leave behind the material which didn't make it onto 'Luminaries…', which was only omitted because of time constraints and certainly not quality issues. It's very much made of the same dewy, crystalline essence as its predecessor, full of those breathy, gently coital vocals and sheets of gauzy, skin-prickling synth harmonics which sound quite unlike anyone else we can recall. She opens the A-side with the minimalist, sighing strings of 'The Way Home', using the most sparing chord changes to captivating effect while she coos across the stereo field, before we find her her in gazing, Carpenter style (John not Karen) on the Detroit-esque Techno plains of 'I Never Knew', and arriving at the placid 'Sea Of Dreams'. B-side she dives below the surface in the submersible 'Binah', suspended in gloopy aquatic drones and sustained through reedy melody while the transcendent 'Disappear' loses her to saltier, but sweetly dissonant layers of lapping washes. So, so lush…\"\n- Boomkat",

            "about": "HV31\nCassette edition of 50\nPro CD-R edition of 50\n12” Vinyl edition of 25\nLast December Motion Sickness of Time Travel launched a year-long subscription series titled “Zodiac” challenging herself to record a track a month throughout 2024. Subscribers initially received Sagittarius upon signing up, and following that an email newsletter with a new music piece approximately every 30 days as the astrological season shifted. Inspired by each sign, her extensive study of birth charts and planetary alignments, Rachel’s completed Zodiac weaves together the final 12 compositions in order from the firery infant strong-willed Aries all the way to the watery dreamy wise Pisces. Masterfully blended together to form a seamless nearly 40 minute singular listening experience, Rachel’s signature instrumentations and vocalizations create a vibrant oscillating tapestry that echos the constellational patterns they represent and the cyclical nature of personality traits they symbolize. Available in limited editions on three formats as well as digitally we invite you to experience the twinkling phases, immersive drones, swells of synth, and wordless whispers of Zodiac with us.\nRecorded between November 2023 and November 2024 in Winterville, GA by Rachel Evans featuring synthesizers, voice and effects.",

            "about": "Zodiac is a scheduled album with a new track to be released monthly between January 15th and November 15th of 2024. Purchasers will receive an immediate download of the first two tracks in the series (a bonus track Ophiuchus and the current season Sagittarius), followed by a new track each month throughout the course of the coming year. Subscribers will also each receive a hand-collaged zodiac metallic cardstock card as a thank you in December 2023! Upon purchasing via bandcamp, select the sign you would like your collage card to be in the shape of.\nAs with previous subscription/scheduled albums (2018's Decennium and 2016's Equilibrium) tracks will be sent and only available to subscribers via email until the series reaches completion. Recordings are composed and captured monthly during each sign’s season (in a fashion similar to the live improvised Ballades for each full moon series from 2014). Each track will be between 5 and 7 minutes in duration, making for a total of 13 tracks to culminate in a 2-disc physical limited edition release in December 2024. Once the series is complete, purchasers will have an opportunity to download the album in full in case they missed any track along the way, as well as receive the 2 disc set by mail. You may sign up for this limited subscription-only album between Friday December 15th at 5:30 PM EST and Thursday December 21st at 11:30 PM EST.",
