            "about": "Originally recorded on September 6th, 2022, 'A Gradual Unison' is the first published recording in the Vibra series that uses controlled audio feedback from a Future Sound Systems MTX9A pin matrix as its source.\nThrough the creative patching of the signal to be continually resampled by two granular processors, which are then able to be given tuning and sequencing instructions, it is possible to hear the voice of the feedback playing melodic shapes - in this case, the Static Symmetrical Major scale with a Turing machine directing the octaval distances and other time-related details.\nSonically, 'A Gradual Unison' conveys a series of glassy surfaces that emerge from what seems like nowhere, hanging in the air like a glowing fog, eventually giving way to another chordal bend, with a slightly different timbral texture. The alien microtonal shifts of this piece would pair well with other creative work, such as painting or programming, allowing the listening mind to defer to the subconscious.",

            "about": "It's been twenty-four installments in the Vibra series since the first volume of 'A Gradual Unison' - the session header devoted to the voice of Future Sound Systems' MTX9A active 9x9 pin matrix, used to generate unique feedback paths that can then be routed elsewhere in the modular system and played as voices. 'A Gradual Unison II' returns to this machine with a loop study composition, similar in approach to 'Glass Temple V' and the 'River Ores IX' triptych, exploring the beautiful ambience of pure repetition.\n'A Gradual Unison II' consists of around thirty seconds of looped matter from a larger session, recorded September 6th 2022, which sequenced the feedbacking pin matrix in the Static Symmetrical Major scale, while a Turing machine dictated the timing and octaval separations of the notes themselves. The loop was eroded using DSP from Arturia and Airwindows, and melodically, the resultant piece reminded me of the same feelings I felt when I first fell in love with my friend Brian's music released as Fieldtriqp, when we met twenty years ago. It sounds windswept and forlorn, but beautiful in this isolated sense that is both familiar and surrealistic to me.",

            "about": "'A Topography of Will' is, personally, a high water mark for the Vibratelepathos series, and for my extensive development of procedural systems in general. As with entry number 82 in this catalog, entry number 83 is a totemic event, and stands apart from the remainder of the Vibratelepathos sessions, while also contributing to the definitive representation of what these sessions are designed to do.\nFollowing in the footsteps of \"classical\" procedural music, I've decided to return to the old way of making things that were intended to recur very little, and I've recorded three distinct sessions that are each unique and dynamic, but are designed to be played alongside one another in any number of infinite combinations.\nThe first session is the \"Karplus Garden\" - an assemblage of Karplus-Strong synthesis in the form of five different recordings of varied runtimes, each themselves containing two different Karplus machines each playing only one note. These five recordings repeat over and under each other in different ways across an hour, with each of the five also possessing no less than ten different modulations - stereo panning, volume level and eight reverberation or delay effects on auxiliary sends - every cyclical envelope of which is equally incommensurable, and has been drawn by hand.\nThe second session is the \"Wavetable Garden,\" containing five distinct held-tone forms that swell and modulate through various chordal voices, generated using two wavetable synthesizers - Synthesis Technology's E352 Cloud Terrarium and Waldorf's NW1. Like the \"Karplus Garden,\" these five sessions are overlaid in different ways and routed through subtle reverbs from time to time, again with several hand-drawn cycling envelopes providing the motion.\nThe third session is the 'Subtractive Garden,\" focusing on specific inclusions from some of my favorite analog machines - the Lowrey \"Magic Genie\" organ, Wildfire Laboratories' Yanqui non-controllable CMOS oscillator and Behringer's reiteration of the Solina string synthesizer. These machines are played as lead and mid-bass range elements that contrast against those in the \"Karplus Garden\" for a combined approach that blends analog and digital instruments.\nAll three of these different \"Gardens\" are offered here separated, with my intent being that listeners should feel free to play the three of them alongside each other or themselves, in any combination, for any length of time, as desired. To this end, there is no single canonical recording named 'A Topography of Will' that is or will ever be complete - only these three parts have been given with this set of instructions, allowing 'A Topography of Will' to exist in a permanent state of superposition.\nThe purpose of this complex array is to not only create a spatial and dynamic audio environment that is always in motion, never in a static state, but also to create a monument of procedural work that masquerades in uncertain changes and pseudo-random outcomes, but at its heart is manually composed and arranged, through a creative process that is as much accumulation as it is decision. In our current age, held hostage in the shadow of an artifice whose builders insist is an intelligence, I find these kinds of artistic statements are an essential refutation of those presumptive constructs.\nFurther, the notion of laying bare the entire process used to create this work is in line with my personal feeling that the world would be a richer place with open systems such as these, which would (ideally) make it easier for other creative minds to build beautiful things simply by using their own tools, input sources, decisions and arrays, with something like 'A Topography of Will' being offered less as music or an emotive experience, and more of a proof of concept work that I hope can provide insights into the world of procedural generation.",

            "about": "Anichroma was a set of two sessions that were undertaken on the evening of May 21, 2021. Partially an experiment in FM synthesis, and partially the result of a lighthearted joke. Having acquired a Yamaha TX81Z digital FM synthesizer a few months prior, a number of fascinations emerged from the instrument involving its different preset patches, many of which were used regularly in pop and dance music of the time (see: Lately Bass). A certain singer had a big hit when I was a young boy in the 1980s, and that hit included a lead melody played on a synthesizer that always struck me as sounding strange, perhaps even a bit funny. After discussing my discovery that this melody was played on a similar Yamaha FM synthesizer (the six-operator DX7, instead of the more compact four-operator TX81Z) with a producer friend in Detroit, it was decided that I ought to attempt to recreate this sound within the TX. As it turned out, a preset patch within the TX was incredibly close to the pop song's synth sound, and so all that remained was for me to plug in my Arturia Keystep Pro and play the lead melody from the pop song. Once this was programmed in, I was able to pull the sequence apart with probabilistic values from within the Keystep, and further, route the resultant audio from the TX into the R-EW Audioholistics modular system for even more obfuscation. The sessions that followed were broadcast live on Twitch as they materialized in real time, and interesting conversations were had with the attendees about synthesizers and what kind of possible new worlds could be hiding peripherally within something as topical as a radio pop song from the 1980s. Following this, the sessions were backed up and shelved, until I decided a year was enough time passed to revisit and master the audio for release.\nFrom where I sit today, listening to this strange ambience, I cannot hear any trace whatsoever of the original provenance. Instead, I am surrounded by wavering lines of digital chords blooming in strange formations, inside some deeply surrealistic and purple-tinted space. Anichroma is a completely alien experience, drafted from a highly specific and experimental methodology that never would have happened without the TX81Z being present in my studio. It's hard to feel that the experiment was a failure, or a success, but instead that some other invisible hand dipped itself down into a cosmic pool and rippled these curvatures outward, ambivalent to their destination.",

Despite this very convoluted system, the resultant audio is very soft and pretty, easy on the ear, perhaps distantly echoing its clearchannel provenance, although it could just as easily be that the R-EW system asserts itself in strictly melodic ways, given the right prompts and inputs, but whether it is one idea or another ultimately does not matter. What's left to ponder is two hours of meandering somnolence, a naturalistic landscape of calm and contentment, conveyed unexpectedly from a fully synthesized and digital tributary. Anichroma II is somewhat more accessible than the darker duskier first session, and would pair well with all the usual accompaniments to ambient Milieu recordings - open windows, night air, old paperbacks, dry wine, green pipes, intimate liaisons and introspective drives.",

            "about": "Deep in the tree-lined valley, the setting sun is still bright enough to squint the eyes of weary messengers, slowly working their way back to their lord's castle on the crest of the forest's edge. Their duties fulfilled, scrolls delivered, heraldries pronounced, they now sit by the last nightly fire of their trek, gazing back down into the embers centered in the small encampment. From miles away, they can hear the day's last bells ringing out from the chapel beside the castle, although from this distance the tones are smeared through the dusky air, and instead resemble sustained resonations of metallic horns, pealing out for a last call indoors, before the primordial forest darkness consumes what's left of the day, along with everything in it. They exchange glances, the two emissaries, while passing a small pipe back and forth between them. The greenest grass from the whitest kingdoms, the harvest's finest crop, prized by the farmer, the random varietals that perennially form the spice of life itself. The sunset slows the rigorous pace of the journey to a syrupy slink downward, while eyelids become heavy and the purple sky begins to resemble a vast velvet curtain laid across the glassy firmament.\n2020/04/04 SESSION NOTES: Recorded using the Behringer MS-1 to sequence an SSDP Jade Series as3340 VCO, an analog oscillator with a novel waveform, while the results of this sequencing and voice pair were then routed outward in several different directions - Mutable Inst. Clouds for granular synthesis, the Korg MS-20's external signal processor and CV patchbay, a Moog LPF and ring modulator, and reverb/delay units such as the White Pillar staples of Pioneer spring reverb, Alesis Quadraverb, BBE Two Timer, Danelectro Reel Echo and Synthrotek PT2399 delays and pitch adjustments from a Digitech WH4, with all signals collected and mixed via a Peavey FX2 24-channel mixing desk with custom designed internal DSP FX.",

            "about": "Since migrating my modular system from the basement studio to a smaller desktop setup a year ago, I've adopted a different workflow that has been shaped by a very selective approach. With an L-shaped desk, with the computer in the corner, I've only got so much surface to use for hardware, so my primary recording rig has consisted of my three modular racks, my Vesta Fire tape machine, my 10-string acoustic guitar on a stand and one or two rotating desktop machines of choice. Today, I finally \"retired\" my Blue Marvin ARP 2600 back to the basement, and replaced it with my Korg ER-1 drum machine (my favorite drum machine, bar none) and Arturia's Keystep Pro, a motherbrain of sequencing and probabilistic capabilities with four discrete channels, built to be used with modular/CV in particular. Along with this change of scenery, I felt compelled to test the new setup using the first VCO I ever installed in the Audioholistics system - an SSDP Jade series VCO, which is more specifically an as3340 chip with a novel waveform. Very simple, but very powerful, and very toothy. This VCO was used only once prior in the Vibra series, siring the Apennine Hashish session header for all subsequent recordings made using the 3340 VCO, and while plans were always made to conduct more session work with this source, it never quite happened that way again, until now.\nRouting the 3340 into a 2HP pitch shifter, where it was modulated slightly and doubled with a lower pitch to create a fifth chord, it was multed out to two different low-pass filters (2HP and Doepfer A-121-3) which were swept open and closed by a Buchla 281t quad function generator. These two filtered signals were routed into two different Clouds modules - one with a reversed sample buffer and its output pitched up an octave, and the other set to a normal pitch output with a standard buffer - and these two machines both probabilistically sampled and re-conveyed the 3340's output in differing (but similar) directions. The higher pitched of the two was also sent through a Strymon Magneto multi-head tape delay unit, and from there both signals were summed and panned via a Behringer 305 stereo mixer.\nFor sequencing, the Keystep Pro was given 64 steps and only four of them contained any input whatsoever - four different pitches in the Dorian scale - and told to randomize the sequence on a continuous basis. Between this, and the buffer-scrubbing in two Clouds units, Apennine Hashish emerged as a constant stream of spacious melody and distant twinkles of sun burning through soft white cumulus. Multiple takes were recorded using varying degrees of master clock information, different octaves of sequence playback and alternative settings for the filter cutoffs and granular buffer sizes, and these takes may yet manifest later on in this series.\nAltogether, the effect of this patch has been sunny contentment, feeling welcomed back somewhat to this early discovery, like a camp in the woods, and vaguely remembering what happened the last time we were here, but happy to let it go and simply create new memories as the somnolent waves of sound drift on.",

            "about": "The second of three different sessions recorded on November 7th, 2022 with the 3340 VCO from SSDP's Jade series, more widely known as the \"Curtis chip.\" The 3340 VCO was the R-EW system's first oscillator, and has been used in a number of different ways since arriving - everything from standard subtractive synthesis, to clock generation, granular percussion designs and modulation. For a simple VCO with only coarse and fine pitch controls, a PWM that cannot be controlled via CV and a single 1v/octave input, it is remarkably deep and versatile.\nLike 'Apennine Hashish II' before it, 'III' consists also of the Arturia Keystep Pro as an external sequencer, playing a Dorian scale with several different randomization processes active on a number of parameters. The resultant audio was processed through two different granular processors and reverberators, before being routed through a Strymon Magneto digital four-head tape delay effect. Unlike the second 'Hashish' session, however, much of the timing information, range of the scale and other small details were adjusted before recording, allowing for the same patch to yield an entirely different pastorale to wander within.",

            "about": "Closing out the fourth leg/season/section of Vibratelepathos with the eightieth release is the (aptly numbered) fourth Apennine Hashish session, exploring a deliberately easy and accessible patch with the as3340 \"Curtis chip\" oscillator in the major pentatonic scale. Supplementally, other FX processors were involved, such as two iterations of Mutable Instruments' Clouds (running the Parasites alternative firmware), Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay and Starlab reverberator and Noise Engineering's Versio (running the superb Reticulum Versio firmware for a multi-part asynchronous delay - thank you David Briggs).\nAll of this, as usual, accumulates into a cloudy dream of warm synthesis that hardly resembles the novel angular waveforms of the 3340 VCO, and thanks to prodigious multing and stereo processing of the original monophonic signal, this one seed of a sound becomes a forest to get lost within. I say forest here, because some aspect of this session reminded me of Wolfgang Voigt's perennial GAS project, although if I'm honest this is more of a feeling rather than being able to point at any specific aspect of the music.\nI made the point to close the fourth leg of Vibratelepathos with the 3340 also because it was the very first oscillator in my now considerable modular system, back in January of 2020. It was graciously mailed to me by SSDP in Canada, along with a switch mixer, a mult/inverter and a phaser, in exchange for mastering work I was doing at that time. In those early days, the 3340 was used for not just tonal work, but as a clock signal generator and even as the genesis for a primitive system of procedural techno (on the Coppice Halifax albums 'Aro' and 'Interkovris' for those curious). It paved the way forward for a long list of purposes and processes that I now use other tools for in my modular system, but still it remains installed as the first module at the top left of my main rack, and hopefully 'Apennine Hashish IV' illustrates just how much love I have for this oscillator now.",

            "about": "Sometimes, with so many sessions taking months, or even years, to surface for their inclusion in the Vibratelepathos catalog, it becomes necessary to break apart from the schedule and issue a recording that is brand new, if for no other reason than to maintain a level of current thinking and workflow approach within the catalog as time goes on. BLUE EMERALD HALFTONE is such a session, recorded mere hours before being published here - as close to the actual moment of conception as is possible, except for a proper live performance - and it reflects many different facets of my current creative thinking.\nTo begin, all sessions produced under the BLUE EMERALD HALFTONE header are created using only Buchla oscillators as their tonal source, as well as much of their modulation, given how well-designed Buchla devices are with feedback loops and frequency modulation in mind. These details may seem that they might yield obtuse results, noisy patches and unstable pitches, but to the contrary - Buchla voices, when appropriately filtered, shaped and sequenced, can sound like some of the most divine synthesizer voices imaginable, like the clouds in a blue sky parted to reveal horns and a pipe organ built into the firmament itself. Whether Buchla machines were used or not in certain classic electronic recordings, I have found many similarities to Eno's seventies productions such as Discreet Music and his first two albums with Robert Fripp, in the sounds emanating from these devices. There are beautiful timbres almost always within reach, and even with a modest rig such as mine (I currently own two Buchla modules, which themselves contain six tuneable voices) it is continually possible to derive gorgeous results from what seems like very little patching at all.\nOf course, it is pointless and selfish to compare my work to a master such as Eno - in truth, I can only ever hope to make myself happy within my creative process, and I feel that I have done so here, even if and when my work echoes back to me shades of others that I've spent so many years listening to that they must permanently reside in my subconscious. Who knows if anyone else besides myself would even hear those things in these recordings?\nIn the end, BLUE EMERALD HALFTONE represents a longform work of quiet synthesizer music, generated by a sequencer brain that functions according to Dress's sequence (  oeis.org/A001316  ) in the form of four major pentatonic scales. The master clock of each sequence is also triggered by a probabilistic and progressively subtractive module called Missed Opportunities, essentially allowing fewer and fewer trigger events to happen according to the same singular master clock. Two oscillators from two different Buchla modules - 258t and 281t - were summed via Tiptop's MISO and routed in groups of two to low-pass filters from 2HP and Doepfer, before being multed into a Behringer 305 mixer as a dry stereo signal, and into Strymon's Magneto digital tape-delay module, itself also sent into the 305 for final attenuation and panning. At any point in the development of this patch that required numerical input, one of three numbers was arbitrarily chosen: five, seventeen or twenty-two. This includes Brownian probability ranges, modulation depths and intensities, time divisions and other esoteric parts of the process.",

            "about": "Blue Emerald Halftone returns in its second iteration, with two extended sessions further exploring the sound of Buchla 258t dual oscillator voice, recently reissued in Eurorack format by Tiptop. Both sessions rely upon an analog shift register for their melodic personalities, led by a Turing machine handling the timing of the sequencing. The first session utilizes a Japanese scale, the second a scale developed from Scottish bagpipes, with both lending a unique chordal profile to the functional rotation of the shift register's output.\n(In layman's terms, a shift register produces multiple iterations of a singular melodic sequence, each one staggered a given length of time after the last, making it function well for compositional structures that feel fugue-like, and allowing for chordal forms to emerge from otherwise monophonic machines, when patched accordingly.)\nBoth of these sessions are mixed in a very dry way, opting to highlight the smooth textures of the Buchla oscillators with relatively little reverberation, although some very back-of-house reverb was used in order to widen the stereo field and animate some of the textural incidents that crop up throughout.",

            "about": "The third Blue Emerald Halftone session arrives as a cloud of warmth and desaturated navy blues and light greys, following on the second session from August of 2022, which experimented with Japanese and Scottish bagpipe scales. At just over three hours in length, B.E.H. III rolls across the landscape in a languorous way, less like music and more like weather. Recorded on May 7th, 2023 using the Mixolydian scale alongside three granular processors to transmute the Buchla 258t dual oscillator, this session would be best suited to reading or sleeping, rather than something more inert for creative work like programming, writing or painting - although it bears repeating that there is no right or wrong way to experience this sonic fabric, and however you choose to explore it is complete and correct.",

Originally recorded in February 2023, this piece differs from the previous 'Blue Emeralds' in that it feels more minimalistic and drone-like, although closer listening will reveal more melodic changes beneath the stasis.",

            "about": "As ironic as it may outwardly seem for me to worry that certain recordings are too minimalistic for a catalog of ambient music, this is in fact the sentiment I've struggled with for the fifth Blue Emerald Halftone session. Recorded almost completely within the six modules of the Buchla 200 system that are integrated in my modular arrangement - an entire row is dedicated to those alone in the largest of my three cases - it was a unique piece of music when it happened, with the two oscillators in the 258t playing a tuned-by-ear set of two sequences on the 245t five-step sequencer, with timing information for the sequence originating from the Annular Fusion mode in the Hemispheres firmware for Ornament & Crime - a Euclidean dual-pattern generator, playing two different sets of an even number of steps against the five notes in the two Buchla sequencer lines, creating a constantly rotating rhythmic structure (can you tell I wanted a Moog Subharmonicon before I had one?). It felt somewhere between things like Glass Temple and something yet undefined, a point in between two other points that sounded coherent to me, but confounded me as well in terms of how resistant it became to overdubs and additional post-processing.\nSo, in the end, as you now see, I have decided to publish it in this series, bearing an absolute minimum of post-processing (specifically a couple semitones lower in pitch, some parametric EQ to remove analog noise, some subtle stereo widening from Airwindows and a *very* distant breath of echo on an auxiliary send) and offer it more or less as it was when it emerged from the modular system that day in very late December of '23. As simple as it is, the combination of the five-step sequencer and Euclidean phrasing alongside the timbrality of the voice being sort of a very Moog-adjacent Rhodes electric piano sound (with the eroded square waves and not-quite-sines that the Buchla does so beautifully) is very captivating to listen to for me, with the melodic cadence always sounding as if it is about to fall apart and end, but it never quite does.",

The sixth iteration of \"Blue Emerald Halftone\" is a quietly hopeful piece of melodic synthesizer music with a minimum of post-processing, running for just over two hours. It feels apt to be published now, during a particularly rainy week here in the valley, and illustrates yet again how versatile and emotive the Buchla oscillators can really be.",

            "about": "'Braided Channel' was a session from October 2022, exploring one of my favorite Karplus-Strong voices - the 'hidden' Resonestor mode in the Parasites alternative firmware for the Mutable Instruments Clouds module. This mode generates multiple chordal outputs from any input signal - noise, triggers or other audio - and shapes them with a series of filters, envelopes and probability-based granular samplers. It is topically very easy to create dub chords with this machine, but it also conveys lush pastures of colorful polyphonic sound when treated as an ambient instrument. 'Braided Channel' is the first session header to publish work in this approach, with more sessions to follow. This first recording aptly complements the sunny and warm (but still windy, humid and mild) Summer season we've been lucky to have in the river valley this year, and like the weather, offers hints of the Autumn cool that is imminently arriving.",

            "about": "'Braided Channel' returns with a second iteration of the ear-caressing Resonestor mode in Mutable Instruments' Clouds (a secondary mode of operation available in the Parasites alternative firmware, which allows the module to become a Karplus-Strong chordal resonator). More washed out and perhaps watercolored than the first, this session utilizes long envelopes in conjunction with Strymon's Magneto and Starlab effects processors, as well as the oft-used Lo-Fi mode in Noise Engineering's Multi-Versio, to generate reams of soft-edged sonic hills, through which we are carried on the surface of a silent river. This blurry session should be cozy and inviting with the cold weather outside, although ideally it should be more than capable of transporting you away from wherever you are, with whatever may be happening around you. It is my sincere hope that this sound reaches you and accomplishes only this.",

            "about": "The third iteration of \"Braided Channel\" arrives following just a few days after the Spring Equinox, with the second iteration already seeming like a distant memory, having been issued as far back as November 2023 - an epoch, in this series. It continues the deep exploration of the Resonestor mode in Mutable Instruments' ubiquitous granular synthesizer Clouds, although this mode is admittedly the result of continued third-party development outside of Mutable Instruments, though certainly only made possible after Mutable's founder released all of her amazing work as open source when the company closed. Resonestor, if I am being honest, is such a rich mode of Karplus-Strong chord-shaping that it was one of the primary reasons why I felt compelled to buy a *second* Clouds module, and this was the first time (but not the last) that I decided to do such a thing in my modular system, and with the perennial considerations of rack space in mind, this was not a decision I made impulsively.\nHopefully, this third session accurately illustrates yet again what I love so much about this machine, and why two are indeed better than one. What you hear in this recording is three takes of a patch with two Clouds modules in Resonestor mode, overlaid in post, forming a hallucinatory ascent into the rare air of a blue sky, as you watch the Earth below abstract into greens and browns, eventually swallowed up and bent by the blue curvature of the planet's surface. This could be the sound of atmospheric systems in communion with one another, the accumulation of evaporated moisture, the formation of raindrops. Clouds, as a machine, can be and say many different things, but it is always able to live up to its name, and then some.",

            "about": "BURNT ATLAS is the first VIBRATELEPATHIC session, created by using a ByteBeat digital audio workstation to generate modal polyphonic sequences, which were then recorded in four iterations to a Vesta Fire MR-10B multitrack tape machine (utilizing pitch deviation and selective use of the dbx noise reduction function). From there, the tape was played back forwards and backwards, at several different IPS, as it was routed into a custom built modular system containing Mutable Inst. Clouds and four Green Series modules from SSDP Synthesis. Additional control voltage automation was employed via a Korg MS-20, three Moogerfooger units and an Arturia Microbrute, and the MS-20's external signal processor was also used. Multiple long-form recording sessions of varying running times were digitally captured using a Peavey FX2 hybrid mixing console, with point-specific applications of both analog and digital effects processors made in real time. The resultant audio was imported onto a personal computer for final edits, parametric equalization, compression and mastering gloss.",

            "about": "BURNT ATLAS II is the second VIBRATELEPATHIC session, created by using a ByteBeat digital audio workstation to generate modal polyphonic sequences, which were then recorded in four iterations to a Vesta Fire MR-10B multitrack tape machine (utilizing pitch deviation and selective use of the dbx noise reduction function). From there, the tape was played back forwards and backwards, at several different IPS, as it was routed into a custom built modular system containing Mutable Inst. Clouds and four Green Series modules from SSDP Synthesis. Additional control voltage automation was employed via a Korg MS-20, three Moogerfooger units and an Arturia Microbrute, and the MS-20's external signal processor was also used. Multiple long-form recording sessions of varying running times were digitally captured using a Peavey FX2 hybrid mixing console, with point-specific applications of both analog and digital effects processors made in real time. The resultant audio was imported onto a personal computer for final edits, parametric equalization, compression and mastering gloss.",

            "about": "Over fifty catalog entries later, Burnt Atlas returns with a third iteration. Revisiting the same source sound and process as before, Burnt Atlas III consists of a generative arrangement of incommensurable loops, using three sinewaves each playing a Bb major scale, which originated within the ByteBeat DAW in the No Man's Sky video game, and were multitracked on a dictation-grade cassette tape (repurposed from a church sermon recording) on the Vesta Fire MR-10B four-track tape machine, with the dbx noise reduction applied to soften and filter any edges in the sound. From there, the tape was played back at a slower IPS into the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, where it was sampled in a granular processor with a continuous eight-second buffer, probabilistically mined for tonal and timing variance. The subsequent mix was recorded back into the computer via Goldwave, and final-glossed there.\nTexturally, Burnt Atlas III is less tape-saturated than the first two volumes, despite the same tape machine being employed in all three sessions, and recalls aspects of Synergy's 'Computer Experiments Volume One' album from 1981, which was an early piece of electronic music I was exposed to prior to Milieu existing. Chordal shapes are in constant flux, and although the piece is melodic, it is almost completely serial, making it difficult to latch onto, and rendering it almost forcibly ambient.\nThis session is perhaps better suited to waking relaxation, such as studying or reading, or working on other tasks, rather than sleeping music. It possesses a brightness that feels both warm and synthetic at the same time, and was designed (initially) to be more or less a set of digital windchimes to leave running 24/7 on my capital ship in NMS.",

            "about": "\"Drawn Along a Wavering Edge\" is the session header for a new line of explorations, diving deep into a machine that is so utterly simplistic that it actually has no outward controls whatsoever. The Yanqui oscillator from Wildfire Laboratories - long a favorite modular company of mine for their self-described \"adversarial electronics\" - which is a fixed-frequency CMOS oscillator that emits a constant tone with nothing but an output jack on the unit itself.\nHow such a simplistic unit could inspire an entire subcatalog of work here in the Vibra series is perhaps the perfect question to ask before you press play. Since starting in 2020, Vibratelepathos has not only explored the synthesis of sound, but the philosophy in both approaching the creative act as well as reckoning with the sound-matter that gets captured in recordings, to be sifted through usually long after the original spark has come and gone.\nI was intrigued with the Yanqui as soon as it was issued, partially out of just wanting to know what it sounded like, and also feeling a bit like I was up for a challenge of integrating such a simple thing purposefully into a larger modular ecosystem. It reminded me of when I took the plunge on eBay and bought the Grass Click-Tone Control Module, a piece of 19\" racked lab equipment designed for use in a larger system of hospital testing tools, which I'd been able to determine was capable of producing sound of some kind just by examining the faceplate, jacks and controls.\nAs it turned out, the Grass unit did make sound - a monophonic sinewave at a numerically input frequency with a decimal point of accuracy, a series of pulses (the same sinewave with amplitude modulation applied) and trigger outputs. This machine ended up pinging off in the backdrops of almost all my live hardware sessions from that point on, as well as being used constantly in Deep Earth recordings, drone albums and other experimental areas. It has also sired quite a prolific set of albums here - the \"Greenest Grass Whitest Clouds\" recordings - and continues to be used for new things on a regular basis.\nSo the Yanqui oscillator would be no different, a determined exercise in asceticism and creative thinking that has now led both of us here, to this moment in the map. What you hear on this first recording is the Yanqui oscillator being fed into two Clouds modules - granular re-sampling mechanisms with probabilistic output controls - and both Clouds modules have been directed to play a simple major pentatonic scale by Ornament & Crime, which runs on the usual array of Quantermain sequencing, with Turing Machine modulation of Euclidean patterns, and timing information coming from three different clock mechanisms (a simple even-numbered divider, a Boolean gate module and a probabilistic subtractive divider). All of this is then summed in a small mixer and routed into Strymon's Starlab reverberator, and the result of this configuration is what you hear, with the small addition of some mastering work (parametrics, etc).\nThis first session was recorded in February of '24, and as you might imagine, there's already a few more sessions completed following that. They will end up here when their moment is right, and until then, I hope you enjoy this garden of ornamental complexity built out of a single monophonic and monotone seed.",

            "about": "Earthly Branches is the expansive and vibrant first publication of a new session header, which focuses on exploring the voice of the Behringer 921 analog oscillator - an updated but faithful recreation of the Moog System 55 oscillator from 1973, which is unique in a post-chipset world, because it functions completely on discrete circuitry. The 921 has four different waveform outputs - sine wave, triangle wave, ramp wave and square wave - as well as pulsewidth modulation and the ability to change the 'clamping point' of a waveform, which produces interesting overtones and other timbral alterations by adjusting the start of the waveform's output mid-waveform.\nMany recordings have been made with the Moog System 55, but these sessions are my first experiences with the machine, and the way I approached it from within the already assertive personality of the R-EW Audioholistics system changed the behavior of the unit drastically. What you hear on these Earthly Branches sessions is the 921 being sequenced by a Turing machine, filtered multiple times and routed through probabilistic granular processing, a four-head digital tape delay and lengthy tails of reverb, with all aspects of this patch modulated in different directions by a wide array of LFOs and trigger patterns. Extensive use of opening and closing VCAs was employed, in order to constantly change the combination of the four waveforms being routed into the rest of the system - in this way, the listener can appreciate the fullness of the oscillator's power, while also hopefully being able to discern the four different waveforms in different states of prominence.\nEvery moment invokes the name I've given to this session, splitting apart into multiple directions, meandering for a while, and then doing it again, until the space is filled with surrealistic trees made of pure electricity. As with most session headers, more Earthly Branches will follow, but for now, please explore these passages as both above and below ground generative systems.",

            "about": "The ninth ANTIVIRAL BROADCAST is the second recording from the EMPTY SPACE IN RED, YELLOW & BLUE sessions, created using a complex signal chain that begins with feedback and ends in beautiful glassy tones, reminiscent of FM synthesizers and some of my favorite recordings by Alvin Lucier.\nTo begin, RYB was created by wiring up an SSM-1750 Optimus mixer (built and sold by Radio Shack in 1995) into a feedback loop between the mixer's input channels, the mixer's output, and a Nady MM14-FX mixer between the two, to provide additional amplification and modulation via the Nady's built-in analog delay. Careful shaping of the feedback tones was done via the SSM's onboard three-band equalizer, and this output was then routed to a Peavey FX2 mixing desk, where it was multed out to multiple channels, each being processed individually to play back the feedback tones at a different relative pitch. This meant that whatever the input signal did on the SSM, polyphonic forms would fall into place around it, and remain in tune no matter how the initial pitch deviated. Further individual channel processing allowed for these pitches to play back at different staggered rates, and low-pass filtering via a Moogerfooger was also applied to tame many of the high frequencies and noise. The final full mix was sent into a Roberts 450A reel to reel tape machine (using a custom cut tape loop) for an additional layer of analog congealing, and then to a modest modular synthesizer rig (which utilized spectral processing inside Mutable Inst. Clouds) before being recorded digitally and cleaned up within a DAW.",

            "about": "Closing out the third twenty-volume leg of Vibratelepathos is a brand new session header - Enantiomorphosis - designated to all Vibra sessions that explore the voice of the ARP 2500, by way of Behringer's gracious reinstatements. The R-EW Audioholistics system currently contains the 1004 module (a variable waveform oscillator with an optional low-frequency mode), the 1005 module (the Modamp, as the name implies a ring-modulator and an amplifier), the 1006 module (the Filtamp, an amplifier and low-pass filter capable of self-oscillation) and the 1047 module (a multimode high/low/bandpass/notch filter and a pingable resonator). I will likely expand the system to include other 2500-line modules in the future, such as the Mix Sequencer and perhaps the random voltages module as well, but for now, these four machines are more than ample to generate and sculpt a number of gorgeous tones and melodic structures, as Vibra 60 hopefully illustrates.\nThis first session recalls older ambient recordings I've made, such as many found on Sun-Day and on Milieu albums such as Of the Apple. It seems to possess a similar texture to those earlier tape-based works, while also retaining the pace and temperament of its Vibratelepathic siblings. It was this realization that led me to the title I chose for the session header - the notion that once again, this music that I was not writing or forcing into being, but rather mining and refining, was very much a view to all my past selves cast through the fractal lens of a whispering crystal, plucked from beneath the Urth.",

            "about": "The second 'Enantiomorphosis' session continues where the first left off, exploring the voice and filter profiles of Behringer's 1004 oscillator and 1006 Filtamp low-pass filter, recreations of the VCO/VCF in the ARP 2500. This session was colored slightly by use of the Buchla 292t quad lo-pass gate, a vactrol filter and amplifier path, which was employed as a VCA opened and closed by a Buchla envelope generator in the patch. Sequencing was arranged in the Phrygian scale, with Ornament and Crime, using a Turing machine to handle timing events and octaval ranges.\nAlso of note - the majority of the patch used for this session was unchanged from use in 'The Severn Bore,' the post-release party ambient set that followed 'Watch the Head.' This session reorganized the VCO and the path it followed, as well as some of the modulation sent to it, and the tuning was changed from Dorian to Phrygian, with master clock adjustments made for tempo, and the pink noise generator was removed entirely, but everything else in the patch is 1:1 from 'The Severn Bore.'\nMusically, it is interesting to me that both sessions with the ARP 2500 machines so far have been more melodic in nature, whereas I tend to associate the sound of this instrument with the sonorous minimalism of Eliane Radigue. I feel that eventually, or perhaps inevitably, this timbral character of the machines may yet emerge, but for now, 'Enantiomorphosis' continues to illustrate that a synthesizer is not an immutable object, but an expressive extension of the person using it. I may never find Eliane or anyone else within this machine, and perhaps true to the title I've chosen for it, I can only ever expect to find myself.",

            "about": "For the third Enantiomorphosis session with Behringer's recreations of modules from the ARP 2500 system, I've branched apart from the previous two stylistically, which were more spread out and reverberant, and this time focused on the 1047 resonator module. The 1047 is a pingable analog filter with notch, band-pass, low-pass and high-pass outputs, and although I cannot compare it to whatever component of the original ARP 2500 machine it is meant to reproduce, I can say that the 1047 and the 1005 Modamp have absolutely been my favorite modules from this reissue line. Here, it explores the major pentatonic scale, which still somehow manages to sound cloudier and more alien than usual, likely due to the imperfect pitch tracking present in most self-oscillating filters, which never quite retain the same range and versatility of a full oscillator voice, but can produce interesting and unique results all the same.\nThis session was, for a long time, set aside as a recorded pair of two very similar takes - one in major pentatonic, the other in the far more esoteric TrivalentZeus7 scale - and only recently did I decide to separate them, issuing this warmer and more approachable take here and issuing the other more meandering piece under my LSZ alias at Psoma Psi Phi here:  pspsph.bandcamp.com/album/o-e-u\n\"Enantiomorphosis III\" is an interesting counterpoint to this month's other concurrent release in the Vibra series, \"Time Lines III,\" which also explores resonators via three different Doepfer A-188 \"bucket brigade delay\" units designed for Karplus-Strong synthesis. Both are analog machines that use a form of feedback to create their voices, and yet they could not be more different in how those voices are generated. Much of the Vibra catalog has been devoted to resonators of different types, and even no-input feedback configurations, and it continues to fascinate me how differently all of these sessions turn out as the series progresses. As ever, I wonder whether or not I am the variable or if these modes of synthesis truly are as deep as they appear to be.",

            "about": "\"Evergreen Metal Sphere\" is a new session header for recordings made with the VCZIIIa oscillator voice from Feedback Modules, a modern recreation of the first oscillator section from the fabled EMS VCS3 developed by Peter Zinovieff in England in 1969. This first session hears the oscillator's squarewave output being colorfully filtered by Mutable Instruments' Ripples multiple output filter, with timing, envelopes and modulation coming from the Buchla 200 series and Ornament & Crime's Quantermain, which also sequences the music in the major pentatonic scale. Additionally, two different iterations of Mutable Instruments' Clouds are continuously sampling the machine's output and providing occasional melodic counterpoints, and Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay system further spatializes the sound.",

            "about": "Fabled Key is the second session header to be devoted to the ever-expansive Arturia Microfreak, a monophonic algorithmic synthesizer that employs a number of synthesis engines and workflow tools that echo a modular system. While the Glass Temple recordings focus on timbral structures of held-tones such as organs and rotating sets of chordal profiles, Fabled Key instead explores the melodic possibilities of wavetable synthesis with custom designed wavetables, sourced from unexpected pieces of audio, such as mixer ground hum, feedback, drum machines and human speech - all distinctly non-melodic forms, now given the range of a singing voice thanks to the Microfreak's wonderful way with interpreting their DNA.\nIncidentally, the first patch used for this Fabled Key session was initially developed for use in the third volume of Hylian Improvisations, which remains in progress as of this writing, and may bear some resemblance to that series of works texturally. After the session gave way to more distinct Vibratelepathic shapes and movements, it was decided to issue it as part of this series, owing to the multitudes of applications the Microfreak is able to work within, as well as the unexpected and organic nature of this series as a whole.",

            "about": "New year, new color palette for twenty more strange ambient vessels. The fifth leg of Vibratelepathos happens to land alongside what is apparently the twentieth year of Milieu, as a project, and I find this an interesting consideration - having been at this for two decades now, and sort of stepping back to look at what I'm actually doing, as compared to how it was in 2004.\nBack then, everything came with a lot of pushing and reaching and deliberating, erasing and starting over again were more common than a successful take for me then. I've always felt an odd camaraderie with Bob Ross, when I learned that he only came into the style of painting that he was known for many years into his life and painting career - the near-improvisational \"alla prima\" method of using wet paint on wet paint - and that all of his earlier paintings in Alaska were done painstakingly, much more laboriously, with Ross spending weeks or months on a single piece.\nFor both he, and I, at this stage of my creative development, having to invest that kind of time in the creation of just one piece feels redundant and almost satirical. I couldn't be happier that things have turned out in the way they have, as I am certainly able to find paths to many surreal and beautiful vistas quite quickly, and this has become a daily ritual now for the most part, to be able to disconnect for a while, and not have to push very hard for that to happen. I feel very lucky that this is the case.\nI hope 'Fabled Key II' swims through its paraphonic wavetables (here, multiplied to the degree of being four different voices, recorded and overlaid/panned three different times) in a topical and pleasant way. This is a very physical piece for the Vibra sessions, so I would perhaps uncharacteristically ask you to play it much louder than you might think of playing one of these. It feels like relaxing inside a warm and cozy wooden pipe organ that the composer fell asleep on. And for my part in that analogy, I did fall asleep at my instruments for the last twenty years.\nI apologize now, at the end of this unnecessarily lengthy missive, for the candor - you usually come here looking for patch notes, or some prosaic description of what the music might synaesthetically resemble or symbolize - but this year is going to just be a trip for both of us I think. The world feels like it's on fire, and at the same time, the utilities I have within my creative reach feel stronger and more direct than they may have ever been. I think about 2004 again, and realize that I can't really say what I would have expected to be doing (or how) in twenty years. I think, truly, I would only have wanted to be able to do it for that long, no matter what the capacity was.\nSo again, I feel very lucky to be able to sit down and turn on a few machines, and within only moments be able to hear the sound you're listening to here now. It feels too easy, sometimes - I feel like I may not deserve it - but perhaps that is what a close friend recently described as equilibrium? I always have a lot to think about, and the music I find in these machines only gives me even more to consider, and reconsider, so I am happy to have your company as I find my way.",

            "about": "FLAWLESS AMETHYST is the fourth session in the VIBRATELEPATHIC series. It is possibly the most convoluted of all the processing setups shown in this series, thus far, and was born from a patient mother in TIGRESS. When islanders inhabiting the soundworlds of TIGRESS lie down at night to sleep, FLAWLESS AMETHYST is all the stars in the sky above them. It has been mixed intentionally quiet and is designed as an unintrusive sleep and meditation aid, and can play for more than a full 24-hour day without repeating at all. Listeners are discouraged against using these recordings while operating machinery or driving.\nFor the technical side, FLAWLESS AMETHYST is every individual piece on the TIGRESS album, reduced in post-processing using stereo difference, then re-pitched, sent through a Moog analog low-pass filter, and routed through a modular synthesizer setup, which includes Mutable Inst. Clouds and four Green Series modules by SSDP Synthesis. As per the usual when the modular rig is involved, control voltage automation was applied via three Moogerfoogers, a Korg MS-20 and the small but useful CV matrix on an Arturia Microbrute, while the Korg MS20's external signal processor was also utilized. This process was repeated multiple times over, for each of the 11 pieces, until somewhere around the 3rd or 4th generation, the final results arrived. Altogether, FLAWLESS AMETHYST took about 3 weeks from start to finish, in processing time alone.",

            "about": "GLASS TEMPLE was a special session recorded in January 2021, using only the Arturia Microfreak. Unlike most other Vibra recordings, GLASS TEMPLE is the first within the series to be created without using the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. This draws some attention to the formidable tools offered on the Microfreak, which allow users to create very elaborate and complex generative patches without any external systems or inputs involved. In this configuration, the Microfreak patch was designed to need only a single held keyboard note in order to procedurally facilitate everything you hear. The Microfreak was then minimally equalized via a Yamaha KM802 analog mixer from the 1980s, with some external reverb routed in via a Lexicon Alex rack effect unit (another archaic processor), and the final mix was sent through a Peavey FX2 mixing desk. GLASS TEMPLE is an introspective meditation that wanders through various chordal structures, exploring an organ-like voice that recalls my influences from certain Philip Glass compositions, among other things. It has kept me almost weekly company as I sleep and read since being recorded in January, and I am beyond happy to finally publish it here for others to enjoy.",

            "about": "For the second GLASS TEMPLE session, similar tools from the first session were used to arrive at a completely different result. The Arturia Microfreak is a paraphonic digital synthesizer with an analog filter, and an extensive and esoteric array of features beneath its surface, which allow me to facilitate completely hands-free automated patches (which I would otherwise have to accomplish via the modular system or a DAW), and I've developed many such patches with for the purpose of capturing generative organ music.\nThe first patch was used to create the first GLASS TEMPLE session, which routed the Microfreak through a Lexicon Alex racked digital reverb unit, and a Yamaha KM-802 analog mixer from the 1980s, while this second session manifested fully in the digital realm, migrating the Microfreak's recorded output from a Zoom H1 recorder and further processing/transfiguring it within two different DAW configurations.\nNotably, GLASS TEMPLE II uses a nearly four-hour runtime to accomplish its purpose, with a deliberately lowered volume level used to further disengage the listener from actively 'following' the melodic developments of the piece, as well as softening many of the higher octave/higher frequency passages that weave in and out of the patch.\nMusically, it can be imagined that this is the same GLASS TEMPLE as before, merely heard from a greater distance away, with the sound dispersing and elongating through wind, empty acoustic space and other elemental interference that might shape and filter what is audible. Philosophically, especially within the framework of the Vibratelepathos series, there is never any going back to what came before. Everything moves forward and backward and even inward and outward in all directions, and no compass operates as it should in these lands. Time and space are strange here, but not threatening - this is simply a pocket universe where the inevitability of entropy and the fear of isolation are disconnected, and we can be left in perfect peace for as long as we wish to remain there.",

            "about": "The third Glass Temple session was recorded on the same date as the second - amidst a flurry of new recordings made on December 13th 2021 - with the Arturia Microfreak algorithmic synthesizer, and even fewer peripheral tools than the prior two volumes. This third session runs over five hours in length, and what you hear is the synthesizer's generative organ patch (or \"Genergan\" as I have affectionately labeled these patches in the machine) augmented only by a delay chain of only three panned repeats.\nThe quiet minimalism of the piece recalls the understated nature of the first volume, while managing to elongate it and reduce it even further into a new macroverse of melancholy. I am continually impressed by the sonic range and versatility of the Microfreak, especially when it sits alongside my modular system and still functionally explores many of the same impulses and tangents with no fuss at all.\nGlass Temple III would potentially be best experienced on open-air speakers (although headphone listening will still be sufficient) in order to maximize the coloration of your physical space with these somnolent tones that slowly waver like the warmth of sunlight painting the wall. I find these unraveling and reweaving types of patches perfect for reading accompaniment in particular, as the recurrent crops of tension and their subsequent chromatic resolution lend themselves well to the peaks and valleys of a deeply immersive narrative thread.",

            "about": "The fourth 'Glass Temple' installment is another session recorded on the same day as 'Glass Temple III,' albeit with a variation on the same 'Genergan' generative organ patch on the Microfreak, in a different key. This session was modified in post by a single-repeat delay system that also swapped the stereo channels and relayed the sound back exactly one octave below the input signal. The full stereo image was routed through a convolution reverb using an impulse response of the Inchindown oil tanks in Scotland - a physical space that holds the world record for the longest reverberation in a man-made structure.\nThe result of these applied changes to the Microfreak's generative organ is something truly divine, to my ears. It could be the many years of working with the Lowrey Magic Genie organ in my prior three studios that have brought me to this point of appreciating the timbres of the instrument, or it could be my lifelong love of organ music from JS Bach, Philip Glass and, more recently, Benoit Poussin. It could be none of these reference points, and 'Glass Temple IV' could simply be a profound experience at the molecular vibration level.\nIn any case, I'm beyond happy to be able to bring this recording to you, and include it in this long-running series of ambient works. I absolutely feel that out of the dozens of Vibratelepathic recordings issued thus far, the 'Glass Temple' recordings continue to be some of my very favorites. As I am overly fond of saying, I sincerely hope these soundwaves carry you as long and far as they have carried me all this time.",

            "about": "The fifth iteration of 'Glass Temple' is a gentle loop study, following on the path tread by 'River Ores IX' and Limestone Ziggurat's 'In Curvature' polyptych (see:  pspsph.bandcamp.com/album/in-curvature  ) which explores one of the several sessions recorded with the Arturia Microfreak in December of 2021 in a method not yet approached.\nThe loop music format allows for a liberal amount of editing work in the post-processing phase to occur, which in turn allows for a completely different approach to a session that may have otherwise been considered too inconsistent or in need of too much editing to be released as it happened. In this way, what was essentially a soundcheck recording for the Microfreak sessions that followed has now borne fruits that would not have been considered otherwise, with the loop being extracted and isolated to now imply new expressions, different contexts, fresh perspectives.\nLoop music is, in this sense, both an editing discipline that explores an extreme form of brevity and asceticism, and a utilitarian way to reconsider music as audio, mutable and able to be reinterpreted, regardless of its original purpose. It will continue to be a path occasionally taken in the Vibratelepathos series, where and when it feels appropriate, bringing into hyper-focus pocket universes that pass me by in the electric air like motes of dust, hovering above my warm machines.",

            "about": "The sixth \"Glass Temple\" comes into near-focus on the horizon line - the same methodology employed as before in the first five sessions, utilizing a generative organ system within Arturia's Microfreak four-voice paraphonic/algorithmic synthesizer, but channeled through different streams of processing that give a very different impression when the perspective is so far away.\nOriginally recorded on January 14th, 2024, \"Glass Temple VI\" routes the Microfreak's organ meanderings in the Dorian scale through two Clouds granular resamplers, Strymon's Starlab reverberator and the Reticulum Versio third-party firmware for Noise Engineering's Versio DSP platform that offers three channels of asynchronous delay lines. Despite all of these processing paths, each fairly dense with their own mode of coloration, the final mix went through yet another post-proc metamorphosis, being sent through Airwindows reverb and stereo widening paths as well as additional low-pass filtering and stereo modulation from Arturia's MS-20 filter.\nThe final result is like a glimpse of a large structure seen from miles away, lit only in silhouette by the sun setting behind it. There is a sense that wind and clouds have further abstracted this, wavering the outline, making one wonder if the structure is truly there at all.",

            "about": "GREENEST GRASS WHITEST CLOUDS is the beautiful combination of my oft-cited Grass Click-Tone Control Module (a piece of medical laboratory equipment that I have repurposed as a tone generator) and the immensely versatile Clouds texture synthesizer by Mutable Instruments. As with many of the sessions for these Broadcasts, the sound of the Grass was conveyed through the medium of multitrack cassette tape, layered into four harmonic pitches at four different IPS. A bit of actual loss in translation occurred, as the original tape was recorded using my Tascam 414 machine (with Dolby noise reduction) and this session saw the same tape played back on my Vesta Fire MR-10B machine (which uses very different dbx noise reduction). Both machines also run at totally different speeds, so interesting artifacting was present as well. The signal was routed in and out of my Clouds module alongside my modest Eurorack rig, containing four modules from the green series by SSDP Synthesis, incorporating additional CV animation via the Korg MS-20 and three Moogerfoogers. From there, it was routed into my Peavey mixer, which is currently configured to function as an \"Autofugue\" generative setup involving signal multiplication, timed delays and pitch shifting, among other things. Final audio repair and mastering work were completed on the evening of April 19th, using a DAW primarily running Arturia filtering and reverberation tools.",

Vaporous pads of tape-warmed chords slowly waft up from a dew-dripped subtropical pasture, as purple skies give way to turquoise, then soft blue, then a greenish orange as the sun smiles down upon a new day. This is music for waking up, and half-remembering a dream you had, feeling as if you've run for hours despite just now getting out of bed. Slow and soft curvatures of synthesized darkness for you to take your time with.",

            "about": "The seventh ANTIVIRAL BROADCAST is the third phase of the GREENEST GRASS WHITEST CLOUDS session, which uses the same methodology and tools, but yields a much longer and somewhat more psychedelic atmosphere than the first and second passes. Here, multiple delay units were applied on the end of the signal chain, which self-oscillated enough to allow for different kinds of pitch, pan and volume deviation to happen on the multitrack tape source in a more impulsive and performative way. The resultant audio is almost four hours of swirling foggy tonal shifts, almost resembling a distant horn blown from beyond a mountain range. Hints of home and humanity echoing from just out of reach, held fast behind nature's wall. This third session would perhaps be best enjoyed in headphones, or played a bit louder than the other two, but that's entirely up to your discretion. These pieces conform to your purposes, so play around with different listening scenarios until you find something that you feel good about.",

            "about": "For the occasion of the global Marijuanaut's holiday, April 20th, I've decided to release this fourth session of Greenest Grass Whitest Clouds. Like AVB5/6/7 before it, the sole input source is my Grass Click-Tone Control Module - a piece of vintage medical equipment that I have repurposed in my studio as a tone generator - routed through the veins of my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, which in this case includes overtone generation via Mutable Inst. Rings, filterpassing via an SSDP Jade Series phaser and a 2HP low-pass filter, ring modulation via a Behringer 150 and additional modulation via a Bastl Tea Kick, all sent into the welcoming inputs of Mutable Inst. Clouds. In post, the total mixed output was sent through a Mackie ProFX8 with some onboard chorus/reverb, and then to a Peavey FX2 with some additional DSP reverb, before being bounced to the computer and mastered within the DAW for optimal immersive listening.\nThis fourth iteration of Greenest Grass is more textured and overcast sounding than the prior three, a difference likely chalked up to the R-EW system now being far more involved than it once was for the earlier sessions. This recording stands as a testament to the versatility of my system, as well as an encouraging result that clearly illustrates how the same source sounds may yet give way to entirely new universes as time passes.",

            "about": "The fifth Greenest Grass session, following the four before it, explores the voice of the Grass Click-Tone Control Module - a rack unit of hospital test equipment that has been repurposed as a studio tone generator - released on the occasion of \"Green Wednesday\" during the 2022 year.\nUnlike the four prior sessions (the last of which was issued on April 20th of 2021), this fifth session conveys much more melodic pastures, by way of using the R-EW Audioholistics modular system to continually sample and resequence the output signal from the Grass, allowing polyphonic layering and chordal structures to emerge from the reverberant haze.\nMy deep love for the unofficially named \"Lichens\" recording from Selected Ambient Works II is on full display here, with the medically precise sinewaves plucked from the Grass, being played like heavenly woodwinds by the modular system. This session changes not at all beyond the positioning of the controls at the start - it relies upon generative systems like incommensurable envelopes and filter slopes, and probabilistic buffer-scrubbing samplers, to create the impression that it is forever in motion, a flower blooming endlessly like a recursive fractal, and it is a moment like this that I choose to revisit and relax within as often as I can. It is the answer to life, the universe, everything.",

            "about": "The sixth Greenest Grass session, issued in celebration of Green Thursday, is no less than seven and one-half hours of slightly paranoid shimmering sound, sourced directly from a Deep Earth session tape dated June 2017 that overlaid four different pitches of the Grass Click-Tone Control Module on the Tascam 414 four-track machine.\nAs many listeners by now know, the Grass unit was the first piece of new hardware I acquired after moving to Ohio, and it was an object of fascination for me due to the fact that it was actually designed as a piece of medical equipment for ocular testing in a hospital lab, and not a tone generator or musical device of any kind. After finding one for sale online, and looking very closely at the controls on the face of the unit, I determined that it *had* to produce sound, and I *had* to know what it was, and so this four-track tape session in 2017 was one of the first sessions undertaken with the Grass unit.\nFast-forward to today, where I am now hopelessly sliding down the slope of modular synthesis and endlessly expanding racked machines, and I now possess many different tools and approaches for reprocessing existing sound that I did not have before. These new methods allow me to dig out old four-track cassettes such as this one, and slowly drip-feed the sound into my setup in order to spin it out into woven tapestries of alchemical gold.\nThere is something prosaic about exhuming Deep Earth recordings also, in order to find within them shapes and timbres that I did not know they possessed when I laid them to tape to begin with. Perhaps all sound is this way - every grain of frequency band is a macrocosm unto itself, some kind of cosmic matter that can be infinitely changed from one shape into any other - and I am only now discovering this fact.\nIn any case, what I offer you here today is a testament to the arcane processes I find myself continually fascinated with here in the cold studio, how nothing is ever really the same twice, and I hope you enjoy this surrealist room of dark green paint and black glass windchimes, a space to sit inside while you think about sitting in space.",

            "about": "The seventh 'Greenest Grass' session arrives as punctually as the last few have - issued on 4/20 of the '24 year - and contains a lush green soundworld that plays the Aeolian scale against a minor pentatonic scale, using two granular samplers each sampling the Grass Click-Tone Control Module, my oft-included racked tone generator that isn't actually a tone generator at all, but a piece of medical lab equipment from the 1980s.\nThe Grass unit, being a medical device, concerns itself with extremely precise outputs of sinewaves, as well as trigger outputs and pings, so it follows that it is an immensely valuable sound source alongside a modular system that has been primarily designed to make the most out of simple single-voice monophonic output signals like this one.\nAll the technical jargon aside, this session is a cozy almost four hours of deep listening and aural escapism, and I hope it meets you where and when you are on this most green of April days.",

            "about": "It's another green Sunday, another windy valley Spring season, and for many reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with the beautiful weather in Ohio, it feels bittersweet on the nicest of days. This eighth installment of the Greenest Grass subheader once again returns to the voice of the Grass Instruments Click-Tone Control Module, prolific in its mentions here in the Vibra catalog. For newcomers, the Grass machine is a racked piece of hospital equipment, designed as part of a larger system for laboratory testing, and somewhere in the tangle of my long love affair with vintage hardware and unorthodox noisemakers, I acquired this machine and repurposed it to play beautiful music, with the help of my modular system.\nIn this recording's case, what you hear is the Grass, first sampled on dictation-grade cassette tape, then re-sampled in the computer, then re-re-sampled in my modular system, going from a 2hp Play sampler to two different Clouds modules from Mutable Instruments, which then play the sound back in the Aeolian and Minor Pentatonic scales, with the timing of the melodic sequencing originating from the Gate Phaser program in Allen Synthesis' EuroPi, a six-channel gate sequencer based on Steve Reich's compositional methods. The notes chosen in the scales themselves were derived from two Dual Turing Machine programs in the Phazerville version of Ornament & Crime, and the post-processing on this recording was accomplished in FL Studio using Airwindows processors and deprecated digital delays.\nAs usual, none of this information will be useful to the everyday listener, so a more topical description of this recording would be that you will hear meandering asynchronous sinewave melodies fluttering around the stereo field, feeling a little wistful, as if they are missing someone who has been absent for long enough that the sensation of possibly never seeing them again has only begun to sink in. Standing on the precipice of nearly abandoned hope, warming under the paradox of a glowing orange sunbeam and a clear blue sky.",

            "about": "\"Ground and Sky\" is a session header for all music recorded for this catalog with the ARP Odyssey monophonic analog synthesizer. Years ago, before I began working with modular music, this machine found its way to me after David Tagg purchased it and found that it unfortunately did not meet whatever needs he had at that time. I offered to purchase it from him, and it almost immediately became an all-time favored machine in my studio, not just because of the sound of it, but also because of the beautiful and concise design of the unit itself. The Odyssey remains firmly in my top five synthesizers I've ever played, even though over one-hundred releases with other machines have come to pass in this series before finally issuing one with the Odyssey.\nThe Odyssey has been all over several albums and projects of mine, however - playing lead lines on things like \"Watch the Head\" and \"River Mural\" as well as droning away in the Workingman's Drone series and burrowing through bedrock in my Deep Earth excursions. It appeared primally on the quadruple-album \"The Plucked Seed\" and even shaped some dub chords on various other Coppice Halifax pieces. Somehow, I always knew it would arrive in the Vibra catalog, but the moment had to be right, and as much as I adore the Odyssey, it seems to really shine when it plays alongside other machines, rather than simply flying solo, and so a Vibra session with the Odyssey eluded me for some time.\nThis session came to be in late September of 2024, working with the Odyssey in conjunction with Strymon's Magneto, a four-head tape delay unit that can also function a bit like a pitch-shifter-drawbar-organ processor, sampling the incoming audio and replaying it at four different pitch iterations. It was this approach that yielded the first Vibra session with the machine, a moody and isolated piece of music in the Phrygian scale, augmented by two granular resynthesizers in Mutable Instruments' Clouds, and another Strymon machine, the Starlab reverberator.\nAltogether, \"Ground and Sky\" feels developed enough melodically that it almost feels to me that it could not have come out of this machine, and strangely this sensation deepens when the chords occasionally emerge from this very monophonic machine and emanate a profound sense of disconnection. It feels apt to begin the 2025 year with this session, although I can also assure listeners that there are many joyous pieces already recorded that will follow Vibra 101 in this next leg of the series too.",

            "about": "The second \"Ground and Sky\" session with the ARP Odyssey dual-oscillator analog monosynth, which was recorded late September 2024 with external sequencing and processing by the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. This second iteration was sequenced by Ornament and Crime's Quantermain sequencer in the major pentatonic scale, with additional melodic support via the granular re-sampling tools in two instances of Mutable Instruments' Clouds, and additional signal processing by Strymon's Magneto four-head tape delay system and Starlab reverberator. \"Ground and Sky II\" follows the first volume with another plaintive depiction of a landscape emptied of people, where the melodies can ring outward uninterrupted, forming ornate structures that vibrate through the air. The ARP Odyssey's distinct timbral profile again carries and informs the piece, not really resembling my other ARP remake machines like the Blue Marvin (2600) or the four modules (now retired) from the 2500 line either.",

            "about": "HORIZONTALS is one of two different night sessions, consisting of a more modest early build of my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, back when it was still contained in a mere 84HP case, and I was able to bring it upstairs to my bedroom, to generate ambient sound in realtime according to my mood and other needs. You can hear the Karplus-Strong string synthesis of Rings playing a lead role here, animated by Ornament & Crime as well as other modulators, and augmented by SSDP's as3340 VCO and self-oscillating Phasr module as well. The whole drifting swirling mass swells and recedes in and out of Clouds, slowly revealing a sonic structure that recurs in terms of temperament and texture, but never stays the same twice melodically. HORIZONTALS here offers a distinctly more melodious ambient experience than many of the drone-centric Vibratelepathos sessions, a difference that I hope new and current listeners can appreciate.",

HORIZONTALS II offers an interesting and much darker counterpoint to the first HORIZONTALS session, instead conveying long and drawn out exhalations of tones that sound as if they could be metal pipes slowly dragging across a wide factory floor. Spacious and aromatic night music, appropriate for Winter snow-ins and perhaps some weird fiction paperback reading as well.",

            "about": "The third Horizontals session manifested two days prior to Xmas Day 2021, when Ohio laid exhausted at the end of another pandemic year, beneath a wet blanket of cold rain instead of the customary snowfall. Still, the cold air and valley wind are more than enough to inspire one to remain inside in the darker months, and so Horizontals III manifested in a bed, as its title indicates, under cozier, dry blankets, using an FM synthesizer installed on a mobile phone.\nThe initial recording was then routed into the R-EW Audioholistics modular system the following day for subsequent processing and mastering, and although this recording was drafted during the colder months, the resultant textures feel more akin to the damp rebirths of Springtime instead, which is why they appear here and now.\nThe generative use of arpeggiators, the digital synth voices routed through analog filters and tape delays, and the general melodic profile of Horizontals III recalls Milieu recordings such as Daughter and the Hylian Improvisations albums, and would appeal to fans of those releases.",

            "about": "\"Horizontals\" returns in its fourth iteration, being absent from the Vibra catalog since the third volume in 2022, which opened the third year of the series. To once again unintentionally make the point of just how voluminous my archive of unreleased work runs, this fourth session dates back to mid-October of 2021, only now surfacing for a final mastering pass and a release.\nAs with all prior \"Horizontals\" sessions, it was primarily made in bed, tinkering with the unexpectedly deep six-operator FM synthesizer Synprez, and subsequently being reprocessed by some other phone apps that allow for FX proc and other editing on sound files. I do this to unwind quite often - surprising, I'm sure - and although this lethargic half-awake creative meandering usually only leads to more experimental passages and textures, sometimes beautiful things emerge, such as this. It was migrated into my DAW and final-glossed here in the closing days of the '24 Summer season, mostly using Airwindows and a parametric EQ, and a little bit of manual shaping in Goldwave.\nThe warm and slow sweeps of chords that arpeggiate through a few octaval phases repeat a simple melodic phrase, which begin at the same point but diverge from each other at different rates, becoming abstracted into something that feels synaesthetic to me with the turning of the leaves and the orange days that are fast approaching. It is also satisfying, in its own way, to bring a piece of music full-circle, having begun life in my bed and reached its final configuration for optimum bedtime listening. An old friend may have called it \"dream compost,\" while I can simply call it a night.",

            "about": "Sometimes I find things without looking for them, and this notion becomes especially apparent when I am going through older sessions and archived material seeking a specific recording, and something turns my ear in such a way that it feels entirely new again, and in that small moment, I can see and hear everything that could branch apart from that sound, like glimpsing a possible future in a vision.\n\"Horizontals V\" emerged from one such moment, while I was perusing some six-operator FM synthesizer tracks from as far back as 2016, when I still lived in South Carolina. These pieces were prototypical things, at the time made for mulching and composting in the early Telekomm tracks, most of which remain unreleased today, for no specific reason at all. Some of these pieces led to the development of the \"Daughter\" album couple years later, but in 2016 FM synthesis was still quite arcane to me, and I used it experimentally.\nWhile flipping through files from these sessions, my ear latched onto a certain three-note sequence, and I immediately cut a loop and saved it separately. That loop was then arranged in the left, right and center stereo channels in three different pitch iterations, and subtly filtered and delayed via Waldorf's D-Pole, with supplemental shaping from Airwindows and Arturia's Mello-Fi. \"Horizontals V\" is like three loop studies all playing at once, sometimes gathering in a beautiful chordal unison, and at other times, falling apart beautifully in a dreamlike drift.\nIt's an interesting feeling, to go back to old things and find new ones, and then step away and realize that you're never really a creator of anything, but merely the discoverer, and that the very real possibility exists that I have long since recorded more than enough sound to tape, and for the rest of my lifetime, and perhaps many others, I could walk back through those landscapes and find myself a stranger.",

            "about": "In Golden Poison is the second half of the session that produced Roman Fountains, utilizing a unique but incredibly effective method of transfiguring audio sampled from an Impressionist piano music compact disc via Fast-Fourier Transforms, and subsequently routing it into the R-EW Audioholistics modular system for further processing and elongating. Like Roman Fountains, IGP's session is filled with glassy bell-like tones and resonant metallic surfaces, but unlike Fountains, it yields a slightly darker set of overtones in its much larger yield of sound matter. IGP feels cosmic, like an alien tranquilizer employed to sedate an astronaut for an unfathomably long voyage. It sounds artificial, but also familiar in some of the melodic changes it makes. An alluring and vibrant landscape, on the precipice of a great storm, that is simultaneously hypnotic and a little dangerous. Like many of the Vibratelepathos recordings, it offers a beautiful maze of winding chords and spacious passages between them, where it feels pleasant to relinquish control for a while, be taken away and be lost, without a destination.\nNOTE: Like Flawless Amethyst before it, In Golden Poison contains some very deliberately quiet mixes that contain audio at decibel levels far below the mainstream (overcompressed) standard. This has been done in order to facilitate a natural and easy environment for sleeping, reading, meditating or any other activities that sudden changes in volume might interrupt.",

            "about": "Following 'Enantiomorphosis' and 'Time Lines' is 'Intracoastal Undertone' - a third new session header for this catalog - focusing on recordings made with the Korg Opsix polyphonic digital synthesizer. The Opsix is a unique machine, primarily styled after the famous Yamaha DX7 with its six-operator FM architecture, but it branches further out with a complex internal modular-style patch matrix and a deep library of DSP effects, as well as numerous filters, amplifier simulators and gain circuits that allow for many interesting new shapes to be formed.\nIt is, by a large margin, the most involved FM synthesizer in the White Pillar Workshop so far, boasting a much richer palette and function list than the Yamaha TX81Z (with four operators), the Korg Volca FM (with two operators) and the FM voice within the Arturia Microfreak (also two operators). There are multiple FM voices in the R-EW Audioholistics system as well, but those are quite different functionally, in how they're interacted with using control voltages and their extremely limited interfaces, thanks to their ability to fit into a modular rack.\nThis first release was one of several initial sessions with the machine, recorded on May 22nd of 2022, and it explores the unit's randomization capabilities within arpeggiators, albeit at extremely slow tempos and further processed via the Opsix's internal shimmer reverb processor. The result recalls an obvious pillar of my ambient listening - Aphex Twin's SAW II - with a soft-focus melancholy, and a warmth that betrays its origins as a fully digital machine.\nThe title of this session header represents several different points of reasoning, which may or may not become apparent in the subsequent recordings. These references include the disused drawbridge in the Myrtle Beach waterway, and the felt-but-not-always-heard modulators that are a key part of six-operator FM synthesis. As the Opsix is an immensely complex and tangential machine, it follows that 'Intracoastal Undertone' sessions will likely mutate and explore many different directions and ideas that only digital/FM synthesis allow as possibilities.",

            "about": "The second 'Intracoastal Undertone' session originated on May 24, 2022, emanating from Korg's Opsix algorithmic digital synthesizer. This session laid dormant on the hard drives until Springtime 2024, where it was utilized for harvesting loops, which were subsequently arranged into the piece presented here.\nUnlike the first 'Undertone' session, this second one feels much more airy and sunny, rather than cloaked in dusky shadow, using a completely different approach with the immensely versatile Opsix. Here, the same memorized landmark recalled on the first session is instead transformed into a surrealistic pillar, almost holy in some way, towering above the water as the dawn's first rays bathe it in a familiar peach-orange glow. The oppression of the uncertain night is pushed back, and the world again moves forward as it always must.",

            "about": "\"Leaden Monarch\" is the first of yet another line of sessions, a new header designated to all recordings made with the Moog Subharmonicon polyrhythmic analog synthesizer. It is, at the surface, an extremely simple session, more monochromatic and reserved, but I felt that the rich sound of the Moog oscillators and filters were more than ample to justify the piece.\nTo date, nothing else sounds or feels like a Moog, despite there being a universe of analog synthesizers available outside of them, and when I'd heard that Moog (the company) was sold and that operations in the iconic Asheville, North Carolina factory were being reduced, I fast-tracked my interest in the Subharmonicon and obtained one.\nThis recording is in fact my second-ever session with the machine, and you can tell from the way it slowly weaves lines of vibration in the air that I was more or less entranced by the whole experience, feeling like I was communing with something ancient and profound. Although there are no sinewave oscillators in the Subharmonicon, the characteristic Moog low-pass filter rounds off the pulsewaves and rampwaves enough that it is sine-adjacent, with only a hint of overtone, and it reminds me of my many-years-gone Lowrey organ quite a lot, which is another reason I was so immersed in the sound. It also brings to mind sessions like Glass Temple, with a similar timbre and chordal profile, and that feels good too.\nThere have already been many more sessions with the Subharmonicon, all of them different, and there's a distinct feeling that I have a long way to go before I \"hit bottom\" on what the machine's range really is. This first one is, in light of this fact, likely more of a monument in the landscape than a composed piece of music, albeit one that I find myself enthralled before all the same.\n---\n24/7 Endless ambient Twitch channel:  twitch.tv/analogbotany\n25+ FREE ambient albums:  campsite.bio/oscillog",

            "about": "\"Leaden Monarch II\" is the second iteration of my session work with the Moog Subharmonicon polyrhythmic analog synthesizer. It follows the first session of more monochromatic chordal weaves with something slightly more melodic, hinting at the potential of the Subharmonicon's deep well of sequencing. It was recorded on May 15, 2024, and relies heavily upon the Beep Boop Tape Sampler module, which captured a part of the Moog's sequence and repeated it back via a differently pitched and timed loop-phrase, which could then be mixed over the original Moog signal.\nAspects of this session brought to mind very \"classical\" ambient work for me, namely my perennial favorite from Fripp and Eno, \"Evening Star,\" although it may not resemble that album at all for you. I'd like it to simply exist as a warm piece of analog reflection to pair with the Summer Solstice, and I hope you can find somewhere comfortable to recline and drift off, where \"Leaden Monarch II\" can cast its pleasant weight upon you.",

            "about": "The third \"Leaden Monarch\" session, exploring the six subtractive analog oscillators and polyrhythmic sequencer in the Moog Subharmonicon, arrives at the end of a busy April. Originally intended for an Earth Day release on the 22nd, but published here for the final Saturday on the calendar. Somewhat curiously, this was also the third session recorded with the Subharmonicon after acquiring it in 2023.\nAugmented by Strymon's Magneto (a four-head tape delay system) and Noise Engineering's Versio (running the third-party Multi Versio firmware), the Moog is presented here almost unadorned by any other processing. Midway through the piece, a multed second and third channel copy of the initial input is re-pitched one octave higher and relayed through Airwindows' Chamber (a feed-forward delay system in a Householder matrix with numerical values that correspond to the Golden Ratio) for additional harmonic enrichment, but even this second layer only serves to highlight the beauty of the Moog when re-sampled in a higher register.\nThe whole thing slowly swirls around the stereo field, warm and enveloping, feeling a little plaintive, perhaps like a sunbeam in a green wood that hesitantly rests between rain clouds.",

            "about": "LORISIAN FORCEFIELD was a session from December 2020, which explored a single sample of a strummed acoustic guitar, harvested from a 1982 cassette recording made by my father, playing music for me in utero. This sample was conveyed via the 2HP Play sampler module and routed into several other modular destinations, with sequencing provided by Ornament & Crime (using a Turing Machine mode for constantly changing sequences). The two resultant recordings are very wide-lens pastoral pieces, recalling the rural landscapes and remote countryside isolation that were commonplace during my time living with my father in Loris, SC between 2001-2003. I've decided to unearth these two recordings now, during the month I turn 38, mostly because birthdays make me think about my family, no matter how distant and disconnected from my life they may currently be. If any of them are reading or listening, the LORISIAN FORCEFIELD shall be my vessel to send messages of life and love, as I wish for the best for all of them. It feels apt, too, that these recordings carry a thread of bittersweetness about them. Be well, take care of yourselves, I love you.",

            "about": "Panthalassa is the session header designated to all Vibra sessions recorded with the ARP 2600 monophonic analog synthesizer, embodied in the White Pillar Workshop by Behringer's reinstatement of the instrument in the \"Blue Marvin\" variation (which features a dedicated LFO and a mechanical spring reverb within the unit itself). The ARP 2600 is an iconic machine, used by a great many people, and yet it still manages to convey new shapes and textures when directed by different minds.\nThis first volume of Panthalassa consists of two different sessions, originally broadcast (in primordial form) as far back as October 2021, final-glossed and properly framed here for publication. The session used a minimal hardware configuration - basically the ARP 2600 itself, with sequencing in the Mandelbaum scale routed from the R-EW Audioholistics system, with no post-processing on the signal emerging from the ARP. Further granular, filtering and parametric equalization work was applied in the mastering session for Panthalassa, in June of 2023.\nIt is from these two sessions that the name Panthalassa emerged - referring to the superocean that surrounded the Pangaea landmass during the Paleozoic-Mesozoic transition. It occupied nearly 70% of the Earth's surface, and listening to these slow waves of chordal forms emanating from this blue machine, it is easy to imagine such a place. For longtime listeners, it is also worth noting that many moments in Panthalassa's not-inconsiderable runtime recall the Beyond the Sea/Stars albums from 2006 at Infraction Records, illustrating once again that it does not matter what tools I am using, that my music follows pathways that are inescapably recursive.",

            "about": "PLANX is the first of multiple early sessions with the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, undertaken in March of 2020, when the system was still in a somewhat primordial state. It mostly uses granular synthesis and multi-channel overdubs of different pitch iterations to explore dense walls of sound, principally routed into this setup from an Elektroplankton DS cartridge, on a Nintendo 3DS portable gaming system. Elektroplankton is a very unique, and somewhat overlooked, generative sound-design tool all on its own, so augmenting it with the R-EW configuration only serves to expand on those initial possibilities, as is made evident by the lush sonic spaces recorded here. Like RIVER ORES and SECOND COAT, many different PLANX sessions exist as prior entries in the Vibratelepathos logbook, and research in this area is ongoing, so subsequent PLANX volumes should be expected in the future.",

            "about": "It's difficult for me to believe that the Vibratelepathos catalog has now reached one-hundred numbered volumes. In March of 2020, just after the pandemic began, I conceived of a series of Vibratelepathic Antiviral Broadcasts - music that would be built upon the foundations of the many years of ambient electronic recordings I'd made primarily with hardware and software synthesizers, live improvisation on guitars and process-driven work with tape machines, mixers and other sound-altering tools. It would differ from all of those things with the key focus being on building, learning and developing a modular system - a more varied and flexible system of individual machines that constituted a workflow that was completely unique to me, my studio and my creative desires.\nI'd known about modular platforms for a long time before I began exploring this path, being intimidated by everything from worries about blowing circuits to spending too much money on things I didn't actually need, caving to the epidemic of \"gear lust\" and becoming yet another stereotype, always needing that next module to really get things going. By that point in time, I'd already amassed a considerable array of \"in the box\" machines - that is to say, synthesizers and drum machines that were all fixed in their design, unable to be repurposed to the degree that a modular system would be - and my plan was to construct a modular system that would be capable of fielding any sound source from anywhere in my studio and transfiguring it into something novel, thereby expanding the usefulness of machines that were otherwise quite restricted in their range. This plan would be the backbone of the whole design, with the hope that it would keep the system somewhat self-contained, not allowed to expand outside of its necessity and purpose.\nSo Vibratelepathos began with a handful of modular and semi-modular gear - a Cre8audio Niftycase of 84hp, with two Cre8audio modules (a simple sequencer and a dual-oscillator with two LFOs) and a home-build of Mutable Instruments' iconic Clouds granular synthesizer that someone gave me a very good price for online. These things, simple as they were, were ample to begin with, allowing me to begin transforming all sorts of external audio into new shapes, with additional modulation sources coming from my Korg MS-20 monosynth, a small CV array on Arturia's Microbrute monosynth and the CV I/O on the three Moogerfooger units I'd acquired from David Tagg's studio. It was awkwardly done, and unglamorous, but it worked, and through these seeds I was able to next determine where to go with subsequent machines - more modulators, more attenuators (never enough VCAs) and more sources of pseudo-random electricity that would bring my patches ever closer to the ideal of a hands-free patch that would simply emanate the beautiful music I wanted to hear.\nAs the pandemic plunged downward, and the initial five sessions were released primordially as numbered entries, I very quickly become aware of the fact that this was going to get deeper and wider in no time at all, and this Bandcamp page and subscription service were designed to make Vibratelepathos function a bit like a monthly magazine. The other side of the intent with the series was to bring something positive, helpful, holistic (with that word becoming a key reference for the name I gave my modular system) for a suffering world that was terminally online. A digital balm that was equal parts sound-utility and deep listening exercise, and something that was both lampooning and love-lettering many earlier new age albums filled with so-called \"healing frequencies,\" audio placebos for hippies and yoga classes. I have a lot of appreciation for that world, for different reasons, and I don't wish to truly make fun of it here, but rather, offer my own take on these audio-holistics with a fair amount of self-deprecation and levity applied.\nI don't want to put out records that are intended to hypnotize you, or cure a disease, or even help you sleep better. I'd much rather make music that is truly ambient, in the Eno sense, able to meet the listener wherever they really are - sitting inside a car, reading a book, studying for a test, writing lines of code, painting, hiking, cleaning, writing, in addition to all the usual applications for ambient music, like sleeping and meditating and getting stoned and forgetting you left the stereo on. Being able to forget the music is perhaps the most important part of its purpose here, just as one of my ultimate goals as the arranger of these pieces has been to create patches of electricity in motion that remain so dense with movement that I myself forget my own placement within them, and they continue on, by themselves, surrounding me.\nAs much an ascetic erasure of the ego as it is a grandiose exercise in engineering laziness, I often think Buddha would have really appreciated this whole approach of accumulating so many of your own decisions into a network that you can experience the output in realtime, as a passenger would, no longer requiring the distance of time and space between the artist and the art for the ability to truly \"hear\" your music to become clear. I've written about this a lot throughout this series, considering all aspects of the creative process as it applies to modular composition, and I feel that I've learned so many new things along the way that I really am not the same Milieu now that I was four years prior when I started out with all these ideas. Working with this series, and with modular music in general, has changed how I understand sound at the fundamental level. It has provided me with maps of all my other machines, which are now, by comparison, easily navigable, and opened the door to newer futures in mathematics, programming, sound design and (plug your rotten ears, Sam Altman) procedural generation.\nAs per usual, a wall of text and still nothing about the recordings now before you. Ha! This perhaps explains exactly what it is without having to explain it - a piece of music that is monumental enough to prompt a retrospective deep-dive on this entire series and its purpose. It is Vibra session 100, a milestone in the catalog simply because of what number it is, but also, like Vibra 83 before it (  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com/album/a-topography-of-will  ), a freely downloadable album that is intended as both a celebration of the series and a singular proof of concept piece without sequels.\nWhat you hear on \"Polychasia\" exists in two parts - \"Living Music\" is the first, and \"Evening Music\" is the second. It consists of a very \"classic\" ambient music approach of lining up many different sound-events, each with a different runtime occupation and sense of rhythmic (or arrhythmic) time, which are designed to be harmonious with one another in any and all possible combinations. You hear ten unique voices in part one, eleven in part two, each bound to playing only a single note, with the timing of these notes each being different, sourced from esoteric sequencers using Fibonacci values, noise oscillators, extremely slow low-frequency oscillators, Euclidean patterns, probabilistic sub-dividers, Boolean gates and passive resistor ladders. It is what Eno rightly called \"incommensurable\" music, and \"Living Music\" alone runs for over nineteen hours, echoing the durational Sleepbuilding broadcasts that I've run overnight since 2022, adjacent to the Vibratelepathos catalog.\nThe second half of \"Polychasia\" is in fact the first half, transfigured by software systems that function not entirely differently from the modular system, but allow for a more molecular-level view of the composition work after the modular system has been turned off. With the first half of \"Polychasia\" recorded as \"dry\" as possible, without extensive usage of signal processors, only coloring a few of the voices slightly with a very transparent spring reverb in an attempt to present these voices very close to how they truly sound, the second half leans fully into the opposite mentality, sending these sounds through unreal spaces, altering their sense of time, and reshaping them entirely. Altogether, the full album runs for over forty-five hours, once again rendering the twenty-four hour \"Sun-Day\" series that I labored over \"the hard way\" for ten years almost comedically moot by comparison. Suffice to say, if I had a modular when I set out to make \"Sun-Day\" I would have simply made the Vibratelepathos catalog.\nHere's to one-hundred more.",

            "about": "'Ranges Undreamt' is the first Vibra session with the 1983 Korg Poly 800 synthesizer, playing the Mixolydian scale with sequencing from Arturia's Keystep Pro, in conjunction with some filtering, FX processing and granular resampling within the R-EW Audioholistics modular system.\nThe Poly 800 is a widely known synthesizer, either loved or forgotten, and could be graciously considered the \"poor man's Juno\" (likely because both machines utilize digital oscillators, analog filters and similar chorus FX, as well as multi-voice polyphony) - although, as I am now fortunate enough to possess both machines, I can unequivocally state that my experience with the two machines has been entirely different.\nBoth have featured quite prolifically on many different Milieu and CH recordings, performing every melodic duty one can imagine, from bass to chordal keys to lead lines and long pad sections, but the Poly 800 has such a distinct voice and timbral profile that I find myself reaching for it quite often for its emotive expression rather than a simple utility to be performed, as I might consider an analog subtractive.\nThe piece offered here is a picturesque scene of three distant mountain peaks, stoic and snow-capped, forming a wall beyond which unmapped ranges continue. Holy mountains, being a concept shared by many different world cultures, no doubt influence many facets of art, music and philosophy, and these are potent considerations set before us in the natural world, which I feel deserve to be contemplated. Whether or not they are deific in any sense is beside the point, the focus here being a sensation that you are not the center of your world, that things far older and larger than you exist, and it is worthwhile to examine your placement alongside them.\nBeyond these mountains that we have lived in the shadow of across epochs, could there be even more profound monuments? The mountains we can see beckon us to imagine the borderlands we cannot, and what is the creative act if not capable of imagining somewhere we have never been? In this act of subconscious communion, we can express things that are otherwise unimaginable, impossible to define, unheard, unwritten and unseen. Do we not then owe that wall of mountains an offering of gratitude for first giving us the reason to dream what lies beyond them?",

            "about": "The second Vibra release exploring the sound of the Korg Poly 800 digital/analog polysynth from 1983. Sourced from yet another of the multiple initial sessions undertaken with the machine when I acquired it in December 2023, \"Ranges Undreamt II' makes use of a three-section overdubbed assemblage with granular resampling in Goldwave. It is in the Dorian scale, and it is sequenced outside of the machine's internal sequencer using the Arturia Keystep Pro motherbrain.\nThis second session feels a bit more alien and wind-blown than the first one, trading the first piece's stately organ chords for a disembodied landscape of meandering melancholy. Building on the symbolism of the first session, \"Ranges Undreamt II\" is perhaps a view of those same mountains, seen from much further away by lonesome travelers who still have a long walk ahead of them before they can return home.",

            "about": "'Recreation' is one of multiple sessions that explored the reconfiguration of audio recorded during the original November 2022 broadcast of 'Creation' - resampling, reprocessing and ultimately generating something new from the use of audio as composting material, rather than something musical or composed. The oft-mentioned Frequency Blend program in Goldwave was employed, alongside other parametric equalizers, pitch processors and filters in order to arrive at this map point, where it is possible to recall 'Creation' in oblique ways, and perhaps glimpse it from much further away, but at this distance, with this perspective, the atmosphere the audio emanates is entirely different. The 'Recreation' sessions were completed several months ago as an experiment, and for much of the time that has since passed, I have been unsure of what to do with them, until I realized that their entire method and approach have a perfectly suitable home in the Vibra series. They arrive now as a welcome mind-eraser, as I near the end of a chaotic couple of months working vigorously on composing, recording and mixing a new Milieu album, and I hope that they fulfill the same function for you too.",

            "about": "'Recreation II' is the second of two sessions that were grown from reprocessing 'Creation' with a granular resampling system. It seeks nothing more than to offer another vantage point of different perspective on a prior composition, and in doing so provides a sufficient \"proof of concept\" for the synthesis at the heart of this series, finding new shapes, tones and temperatures inside older recordings that can be continually revisited through the lens of new equipment and software tools. Positioned here, at the end of the '23 year, just over a year after 'Creation' was released, I find it an apt point of consideration and a warm piece of synthesizer music to curl up with at night. I hope you do too.",

Anyone familiar with the first two sessions bearing this header will know what to expect: Warm and gentle tones weaving around each other to form incidental chord structures, melodies that resemble an ecosystem within a body of water more than a composition of any kind. The Red Lamps sessions are all explorations of a toy synthesizer, the Bliptronic 5000, routed through the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, which rearranges the somewhat rigid sequences coming out of the Bliptronic at a deeper molecular level, and repurposes them as long strokes of pastel color, set against an offwhite bed of softened noise.",

            "about": "Numbers are never an incidental thing in my work. I think I picked it up from my father, this interest in either finding relevant/recurring numbers in things around me, or the placement of numbers as signifiers of will within procedural systems and a wide array of inputs on electronic instrumentation. It is thanks to this view that I cannot help myself from feeling that certain numbers mean more than others when they arrive in my serial work, and 82 is one such number.\n82 is, or was, the year of my wife's birth on this planet. We were born eleven months and several hundred miles apart, and despite these differences, still managed to meet, and again defying all probability, decided to spend the rest of our lives with each other. This 82nd Vibratelepathos session was always meant to be hers, and so it was almost without any consideration what the source of this session would be. The Bliptronic 5000 is a little square plastic machine manufactured by ThinkGeek in 2009, and my wife got it for me as a gift that year, knowing that my studio has always been a \"kitchen sink\" operation, and that I would incorporate anything capable of producing or processing sound into my rig.\nThe Bliptronic 5000 is a pretty limiting unit, arguably marketed more as a toy than a real instrument, but when it is routed into my modular system and pulled apart at a molecular level with granular resamplers, filters, tape effects, delays and reverbs, something magical always seems to happen. Here, on the fourth session I've done with it for the series, it weaves through various ever-changing delay lines, octaval shifts, reversals and reverb spaces. The last time I had a session with the Bliptronic in 2021, the modular system was perhaps half the size of what it is now, maybe even less. The results recorded here give me enough pause to think I ought to explore it more, so perhaps in the near future I will set it up for an overnight broadcast.\nFor now, the two hours of cozy serialism presented here as the 82nd session in the Vibra catalog feel complete, and illustrate once again that it really does not matter what sound I offer the R-EW modular system, that it can fashion entire nascent universes from even the smallest of seeds.",

            "about": "The sixth Red Lamps session with the Bliptronic 3000 \"toy\" synthesizer is a sweeping landscape of deep chords and long exhalations. Routing the Bliptronic through two different granular re-synthesizers, a four-head tape delay system and finally a feed-forward delay system, the miniature digital synthesizer becomes the seed for a grandiose overgrowth covered with dusky blooms. Something inviting and approachable for the onset of Summer, which is already quite warm, even here in the windy valley.",

            "about": "REFLECTIVE SURFACE CLEANER is the third VIBRATELEPATHIC session, created by using a Korg Volca FM digital synthesizer to generate modal polyphonic sequences, which were then routed into a custom built modular system containing Mutable Inst. Clouds and four Green Series modules from SSDP Synthesis. Additional control voltage automation was employed via a Korg MS-20, three Moogerfooger units and an Arturia Microbrute, and the MS-20's external signal processor was also used. Multiple long-form recording sessions of varying running times were digitally captured using a Peavey FX2 hybrid mixing console, with point-specific applications of both analog and digital effects processors made in real time. The resultant audio was imported onto a personal computer for final edits, parametric equalization, compression and mastering gloss.",

            "about": "Recorded in February, and only now resurfacing, is RIVER ORES, the first of more such named volumes yet to come in the series. RIVER ORES is, like SECOND COAT, a heading I use frequently due to my constant returning to the voice of the synthesizer that creates it, in this case a sympathetic string module called Rings developed by Mutable Instruments. Rings is, within the modular synthesis world, considered to be very vanilla and middling by many graduated modular builders, and it often comes with a reputation for being somewhat oversaturating in the modular landscape, owing to its ease of accessibility and solid design that make it a quick choice for many musicians starting out with Eurorack. I have always believed that ubiquitous tools are just that - tools - and it all depends on the hand holding them, where uniqueness and range are concerned. To me, Rings is a beautiful and powerful machine that can be used for so many purposes, it might be impossible to list all of them. In simple terms, it is both a voice and sound generator, and a sound processor, and it can even be both of those things at the same moment. I have used it many times in many different sessions all throughout my first year with the modular system, and it continues to amaze and impress, which is what prompted me to make RIVER ORES an ongoing series indicator for Rings sessions (and more generally, sessions sourced from Karplus Strong synthesizer voices - Rings is my second, and I will have a third in the new year).",

            "about": "RIVER ORES returns with its long-overdue second iteration, following from Broadcast #15 in December 2020 (which may as well be light years away, considering the scope of this series). RIVER ORES is a broadcast header - less of a proper title and more of a category designate for a type of session - used for any recordings made with a Karplus Strong synthesis engine at their core, and the Karplus Strong voice being explored in this session is (just like the first ORES session) Mutable Inst. Rings. At the time of writing, there are four distinct and different Karplus Strong voices present within the White Pillar Workshop, with more likely to be added over time.\nFor session two, we drift for almost four hours, within and upon unfathomably long resonant surfaces, metallic threads connecting parallel realities, thrumming and echoing in such beautiful phrases that you'd swear we're floating out at sea, pleasantly drunk on a cozy raft, bathed in sun. Perhaps, in some cosmic sense, even these wide oceans are themselves only rivers carrying us onward and outward to unfamiliar shores, to find our footing all over again in a new land, with everything happy and sad behind us, forever distant and unreachable, a faint echo pealing across a purple horizon line, wavering in the heat like a plucked string.",

            "about": "The fourth RIVER ORES session, continuing on the path of exploring Karplus Strong synthesis engines that I remain obsessed with. This session was originally recorded on the evening of July 16th, 2020 - immediately following RIVER ORES III.\nOur bodiless ears weave through a hazy din that resembles dozens of vertical metal poles, planted in a yellow stretch of desert, now only dimly lit purples and deeper blues by the absent sun, gently colliding with one another as empty gusts of air sweep across the landscape. Each pole is uniquely segmented and inscribed, and although these differences would indicate some designated utility, their purpose remains ambiguous, the withery hands that scrawled a thousand thin bells long since departed. Only a few poles are completely devoid of any outer modifications - and these poles stand alone, apart from the others, unrung and muted, perhaps waiting for something other than the mindless gibbering wind to come upon them and, running a hesitant palm across their silvered length, understand.",

            "about": "River Ores is, by a large margin, the session header I've recorded the most material with for the Vibratelepathos catalog. This is primarily due to my deep and seemingly unending fascination with Karplus Strong synthesis, but it is also a monument to the versatility and range of this method of working, that I have yet to become bored with what I find when I approach these machines.\nFor the ninth volume, I approached a session from as far back as June 18th, 2021, which at the time was more of a test run for the Strymon Magneto four-head tape delay processor than anything, and led to the session being quite varied as the patch changed and went through several different phases. This session was shelved until now because I was unsure of how best to edit and present it as a properly mastered release, and only after working on a completely different set of releases as LSZ (the more experimentalist iteration of Limestone Ziggurat) did I come upon the best way to approach this session's final pass.\nThe LSZ recordings mentioned here - Upon the Curvature of a Hill, Grass to Heel and Ranges Glimpsed - all focus completely on a similarly varied session with the Future Sound Systems MTX9A pin matrix, exploring a feedback patch, and they harvest specific sections of this session in order to replay those sections as loops, with different types of processing applied afterward. Loop-based music has long been a love of mine, not just in the usual ambient music areas, but with minimalist electronic artists such as Media Them, and the deceptively simple workflow of looping a given sound over and over for a length of time relative to its emotional content has, time and time again, exceeded my expectations.\nObviously, not all loops are even remotely the same, it all comes down to usage and context and the texture of something that bears repeating, and this working method is an interesting counterpoint to the completely serialized approach of generative music and modular sequencing that I have continued to explore within this series. Instead of melodies that bloom and wilt, but never recur, here are melodies that always recur, hardly ever change, and through this inversion they are able to unexpectedly yield different listening experiences. Loops can make you second guess your ears, make you wonder if they really were always the way you're now noticing them to be, and the repetition and rhythmic nature of their aesthetic also goes a long way toward suspending the listener's awareness of time passing, playing with the perception of the moment in the same exact way a seemingly endless drone would.\nGiven my rich results with my LSZ experiments, it was only a matter of time before I approached loop-based composition here at Vibratelepathos, and like many things that seem to find their way to me without me having to force them or seek them out, it became apparent that this piecemeal River Ores session was the perfect place to find some isolated sections of endlessly repeating bliss. This is what you will find here, three loops taken from the same session in 2021, all using the same patch, the same machines, but re-contextualized in their presentation to highlight and emphasize aspects of their melody and texture and rhythmic cadence that I feel elevates them to something more transcendent and profound.\nAll three pieces have been treated in relatively the same way, using a very subtle phasing effect to alter the body of the frequency bands the loops occupy, as well as some slight tape-like pitch deviation applied globally to the loops, to further enmesh them into a singular beginning/middle/end composition. The subtlety of these post-processes keeps the loops relatively the same, but not 100% exact copies of one another - they are loops played back via mechanisms that are themselves processes in motion, with timbral and textural changes happening in realtime, not at the same rate of the changes happening within the compositions of the loops themselves.\nNone of this is particularly relevant to the experience, however. I'm writing it all here so that you can have at least some small explanation of what I've done, and why, but in the end, the loops themselves will tell you everything, even what I cannot articulate. Music presented in this fashion always inspires me to do other things after the fact - writing, designing, all types of thinking out loud, and so in this sense, I feel that they are just as valid of a holistic tool to include in the Vibratelepathos catalog as the more 'standard' releases of comfortable sounds and somnolent vibrations.",

            "about": "Originally recorded on the evening of April 24th, 2021, RIVER ORES V continues the cosmically deep exploration of Karplus-Strong synthesizer voices via the R-EW Audioholistics modular system. Using a pink noise generator that is attenuated and sent through Mutable Instruments Rings, where it triggers a constant stream of tone, a sonic foundation is set into place for another Karplus engine - 2HP's Pluck - to perform more melodically upon it. Pluck is multed and sent into two different low-pass filters (2HP and Disting Mk4) where it becomes a stereo signal after different (but similar) modulation envelopes are applied to each filter. From here, Pluck's stereo image is routed into Mutable Instruments Clouds, a granular processor that probabilistically sweeps an ever-changing sampling buffer, using what it finds to play filtered and reverberated segments of Pluck's melodies. The sequencing profile of Pluck was not written down at the time, but it was likely something from within Ornament and Crime, as I was heavily favoring Euclidean sequencing for many of my sessions that season.\nAltogether, RIVER ORES V represents another ocean of possibility, singularly derived from the same instruments and tools that created the prior four iterations. To invoke The Bard - if music is the food of love, then play on. The sensation of the endless has never been more appealing, given all the suffering and pain so omnipresent in the world today, and when it becomes not just possible, but reasonable, to fashion entire eternities out of the pillars of designed pleasure, I begin to feel as if I might just trade this world in for another, were I given that choice. Until such a moment of decision may arrive, I have recorded hours upon hours - lifetimes, even - of escapist fantasy to lose yourself within. Here, dear listener, are two more hours, themselves drops in a pond that seems to grow bigger with every new ripple.\nAre we building the universe, or merely discovering it? Or is it neither of these things - but perhaps an answer to our answerless questions?",

            "about": "Recorded on the evening of April 24th, 2021, the sixth River Ores session conveyed itself much more as a river than a metal, with a sustained line of chordal drone that is modulated via high-pass filters like ebbing waves at low tide. These washes of sound accumulate into a fuller harmonic field, while sparse drops of rain land upon the surfaces of rusting bells, ringing out in an absent bliss. In the months of listening to River Ores VI that followed the session, it was regularly returned to at the end of warmer and exhausting days filled with physical work, offering a welcoming balm of blue digital water and the soft noise of windy air.",

While this is the seventh iteration of River Ores, it is also a significant first for the series, using Ionian scales to inform the melodic sequencing, as well as a Turing machine for the timing of that sequencing. Heavy use of granular synthesis, low-pass filtering and probabilistic buffer-scrubbing sampling was employed to convey a hushed but present soundfield, gently muted and appropriately filtered for sleeping and meditative states.",

            "about": "The eighth iteration of River Ores arrives in the midst of Winter, with intermittent snow flurries quietly floating down from a grey Ohio firmament, coming to rest on the edges of a bubbling stream that runs through a white-flecked vale of evergreens and umbral Earth. Here, the lower temperatures slow time to a crawl, sustaining the moment in a glacial curve while dithering out the details of this near-still life, until all that remains is a softened bluish blur hovering in the air of a chilly afternoon. The entire warmth of the sun has been stolen away in the glimmering light that plays off the water's surface, further removing us from a sense of physical belonging, and displacing us somewhere behind a veil of soporific sound, wrapped inside the muted blanket of a dream.\nN.B. This recording is deliberately reduced in volume in order to be experienced \"further away\" behind/beneath the sounds of any given acoustic environment. It can of course be played back louder to facilitate a more \"standard\" decibel level, but it has not been mastered with louder volumes in mind, and louder playback may convey more sibilance and other ringing midrange tones that are not intended to be a part of this experience. As ever, there is no right or wrong way to listen, but please be advised that at higher output levels, your mileage may vary.",

            "about": "'River Ores' reaches its tenth iteration - the first session header in the Vibratelepathos series to graduate to double-digits - with a slow sweeping Karplus-Strong study in the major pentatonic scale, originally recorded in January of 2022.\nIn many ways, Karplus-Strong synthesis has not only remained a dominant voice within my growing modular system's development, but it has informed the paths forward for many other recordings in this series. The simple notion of a resonant surface, built synthetically out of noise generators, feedback trails, phasing changes and filters, is as much a fundamental representation of synthesizers in general as it is an esoteric path to explore with machine programming and generative composition. Karplus-Strong continues to yield new and vibrant frontiers from a handful of tools, a continual proof of concept that music and math are intrinsically connected at levels both musicians and engineers are still discovering.\nAt the present moment, there are no less than fifteen different Karplus-Strong (or adjacent) machines in my modular system. They all possess unique qualities and behaviors, and work well together as well as apart. 'River Ores X' stands as a monument to their versatility and expressiveness, a gorgeous plume of blue-orange smoke rising from the horizon line to the clouds, casting wavering shadows across the river and valley below.",

            "about": "River Ores XI (not to be confused with the erroneously-labeled overnight broadcast of the same name from January 13 2024 - this session will be released in full further down the line) offers a vibrant garden of multiple Karplus-Strong machines (twelve of them, in fact), swaying like a bleary-eyed treeline in the Summer breeze.\nThe twelve Karplus voices are playing in the major pentatonic, although this may not be immediately obvious after the natural detuning that occurs with analog machines like the Doepfer A-188. For the timing and sequencing of the composition, I relied on a complex trigger array consisting of Cute Labs' Missed Opportunities (a unique trigger subdivider), Blue Lantern's CMOS Party (Boolean gates) and Doepfer's A-160-1 even clock divider, all driving Ornament & Crime's Copier Maschine mode, which is an analog shift register.\nAltogether, River Ores XI offers a hazy hour-and-a-half of \"daytime ambient\" that should still be fully functional as a late in the evening dram.",

            "about": "A spacious session with 2HP's Pluck, branched through the many veins of the modular system using Future Sound Systems' MTX9A 9x9 pin matrix. Pulling from a deep well of octaval range, \"River Ores XII\" explores the 22-tET Pajara[10] Static Symmetrical Major scale, and further mutates the result with two iterations of the Oliverb reverb mode in Mutable Instruments' Clouds running the Parasites alternative firmware.\nThe entire mix was assembled in post from two different session recordings of the same patch, panned and overlaid, with a shared stereo send that carried the sound through a feedforward delay system in Airwindows, with the delay constants being derived from the Golden Ratio.\nOverall, \"River Ores\" remains the single most prolific session header within the Vibra catalog, which I always feel must be justified by degrees of variation in their different volumes, and this has assured that the \"River Ores\" recordings are inadvertently an ongoing display of the possibilities within the unfathomably deep waters of Karplus-Strong synthesis. \"River Ores XII\" also demonstrates how well-suited this type of synthesis really is to non-traditional scales in a compositional sense, as the prolific amounts of overtone generation and implied harmony work together to create a soundworld that is both realistic and surrealistic in the same moment.",

            "about": "A far-flung tripartite session from the archives emerges from the basement darkness as the 103rd Vibratelepathos entry. The thirteenth iteration of \"River Ores\" - the most prolific session header in the Vibra catalog, by a large margin, which contains only Karplus-Strong synthesizer voices - was recorded during an impulsive broadcast on 13th September, 2021, testing the deep waters of the Strymon Magneto four-head tape delay processor that has more or less remained in nearly every modular patch since I acquired it in May of '21.\nNo notes were made at the time for what scales were employed for these three phases, and one photograph exists of the arrangement of the modular system itself at that time (included here as a bonus download), indicating that the voices heard here must be either 2HP's Pluck, Mutable Instruments' Braids or Rings. Regardless, the sessions were recorded haphazardly (likely due to the haste involved in setting up the broadcast) and this aspect of the music has kept it locked away until now. Using the same post-processing tools I built the second half of \"Polychasia\" with, I have shaped the audio into more amenable contours, which are more presentable in an aesthetic sense for inclusion here in the series.\nMusically, the result reminds me a bit of very early ambient Milieu albums, such as \"A Dusty Box of Old Memories,\" which coincidentally celebrates a 20th anniversary this year. Something in between the Karplus overtones, the tape delay processing and the smear of the granular re-sampling brings to mind the very monochrome but warm characteristics of my old Boss RV-3 reverb, which was used in virtually every session from 2004 until the pedal finally died in 2020. This makes \"River Ores XIII\" glow with the embers of nostalgia, even though it is entirely disconnected from those devices or studios that produced similar sounds. It makes me wonder just how much my music can (or cannot) change, and why that may be the case.\nFor now, please accept this triptych of lush ambient music that comes from nowhere and goes nowhere, happily hovering over our heads like the clouds in a Bob Ross painting. This set looks upward and outward, to Spring, with a hint of (perhaps naive) hopefulness and a deliberate ignorance of the present moment. A blue blanket, to carry us into the future.",

            "about": "SECOND COAT is the first of a number of different recordings that will be released and detailed within the VIBRATELEPATHOS series. Recordings bearing the SECOND COAT designate are sourced from the Korg MS-20's two VCOs for their provenance, and were in fact the first recordings made with the modular R-EW Audioholistics path.\nOn a topical level, SECOND COAT implies a vast scenic overlook, similar to those I used to stop at frequently while traveling with my wife through the Appalachian mountains. Impossibly tall peaks covered in deep green and mossy brown, with hints of orange slowly overtaking the landscape as the Autumn looms closer. Valleys filled with trickling streams that turn into great rivers, eager to churn forward to the oceanic terminus, mindless in their droning rush. Skylines that are like paint-splattered canvases of melting blues, offwhites and yellows. The MS-20's beautiful way with high and low-pass filtering and rich subharmonic response illustrates this scene in perfect clarity.\nIn a technical way, what SECOND COAT is conveying is the sound of the MS-20 externally sequenced via an SQ-1 analog sequencer, playing back a set of hand-tuned pitches in a random order, and the resultant sounds are then routed into a JVC KD-A11 cassette deck's analog signal path veins for a slight emphasis of gain on the MS-20's sumptuous triangle-wave curvatures. From there, the signal is multed into the R-EW modular rig where it is sampled in realtime and pulled apart into granules, as well as sent to other FX destinations such as a Digitech pitch shifter, an Alesis Quadraverb and a Danelectro Reel Echo. This system is left to generate the recordings in a self-referential way, and the final takes are digitally recorded on a Peavey FX2 mixing desk and migrated to a DAW for final parametric equalization, volume leveling and very light compression work before arriving here at Bandcamp, cleverly hidden behind a play button.\nIn a slight break for the series, in terms of sequencing, SECOND COAT recordings will continue intermittently, since there have been more of them than other more singular sessions, and this is only a testament to the absolute beauty, range and power of the MS-20 as an instrument - that it cannot accurately be conveyed or fully detailed in even these expanded runtimes, any more than Monet could capture and define the sunlight falling across the Rouen cathedral.",

Yet, for all of this, it still feels comforting, knowing even - the hand of god moving across the waves, bringing you ever closer to some grandiose and unfathomable spectacle, some unknowable region at the heart of the operatively endless Atlantic.",

Recordings bearing the SECOND COAT designate are sourced from the Korg MS-20's two VCOs for their provenance, and were in fact the first recordings made with the modular R-EW Audioholistics path.\nThe longest SECOND COAT session yet, III clocks in at just under 4.5 hours in a single, slow exhalation of cool air. Laid to digital tape in February while the weather was still chilly, it feels apt to revisit it for public release now, on the heels of Autumn's arrival, with wafts of smoke in the air, the crackle of leaves falling and cinnamon sunsets bathing our evenings in diffused purple and orange light. Tonally, III most resembles the first SECOND COAT iteration, but where that first session felt more lyrical in its melodic presentation, III is a sedate and drifting affair with very slight and occasional plumes of duophony, bubbling up to the great surface, a wide and shallow pool to meditate in, built with long nights in mind.",

            "about": "The fourth session recorded under the SECOND COAT header finally surfaces, well over a year after it was laid to digital tape on February 25, 2020. Created during a still very cold and bitter ending to a pre-pandemic Winter in Ohio, it feels oddly appropriate to release it as the last days of Summer warmth are dwindling down, and Autumn creeps in with brown leaves, cinnamon and orange-purple dusks.\nMusically, SECOND COAT IV circles the drain for just over an hour, lethargically playing textural variations on a very simple scale of notes, perpetually in some kind of electrical motion within a Korg MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer. Notable use of the pitch deviation between the MS-20's two VCOs is present, with some beautiful and gradual detuning happening across the long runtime. The piece feels like languorous electric windchimes, blown lazily by the last dying breaths of Summer wind, as the acidic orange sun sinks beneath the vanishing point.\nSECOND COAT IV is also an interesting piece to look back upon, this far into the lifespan and evolution of the R-EW Audioholistics system, which did not yet bear that name until after this piece was recorded. A beautiful minimalism to immerse myself in here, keeping it important to remember that with modular and generative music, more is not always more. SECOND COAT IV was created using only the Korg MS-20, a single granular processing module (Mutable Instruments Clouds) and extensive use of the control voltage patch points on the MS-20, three Moogerfooger units and the Arturia Microbrute. It is a perfect example of just how much is possible through modulation alone, and an ascetic reminder of how easy it can be to be lost looking for the next great adventure when building a modular system that can quickly and quietly become bereft of purpose.",

            "about": "The fifth session recorded under the SECOND COAT header finally surfaces, well over a year after it was laid to digital tape on February 25, 2020. Created during a still very cold and bitter ending to a pre-pandemic Winter in Ohio, it feels oddly appropriate to release it as the last days of Summer warmth are dwindling down, and Autumn creeps in with brown leaves, cinnamon and orange-purple dusks.\nMusically, SECOND COAT V circles the drain for two hours, lethargically playing textural variations on a very simple scale of notes, perpetually in some kind of electrical motion within a Korg MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer. Notable use of the pitch deviation between the MS-20's two VCOs is present, with some beautiful and gradual detuning happening across the long runtime. By comparison to the previous SECOND COAT session, recorded earlier the same evening, SECOND COAT V is noticeably more saturated in reverb and long droning passages. The piece feels like languorous electric windchimes, blown lazily by the last dying breaths of Summer wind, as the acidic orange sun sinks beneath the vanishing point.\nSECOND COAT V is also an interesting piece to look back upon, this far into the lifespan and evolution of the R-EW Audioholistics system, which did not yet bear that name until after this piece was recorded. A beautiful minimalism to immerse myself in here, keeping it important to remember that with modular and generative music, more is not always more. SECOND COAT V was created using only the Korg MS-20, a single granular processing module (Mutable Instruments Clouds) and extensive use of the control voltage patch points on the MS-20, three Moogerfooger units and the Arturia Microbrute. It is a perfect example of just how much is possible through modulation alone, and an ascetic reminder of how easy it can be to be lost looking for the next great adventure when building a modular system that can quickly and quietly become bereft of purpose.",

            "about": "\"Tessellation\" is the first iteration of a new session header devoted to recordings made with the Synthesis Technology E352 Cloud Terrarium, a complex and versatile wavetable synthesizer. This first session is one of three recorded in the same evening, using the same patch playing through three different scales in the sequencer, with the selected take being in the major pentatonic scale.\nThe E352 is capable of so many unique timbres, thanks to the way it produces two output signals that are connected to X and Y plot points on a grid of 64 different wavetables, with an additional Z control that rotates this grid. Beyond this, the E352 has modes that morph between two different grids at the same time, or reference them in a more granular way, among many other operational possibilities. Given these considerations, the E352 will never be accurately represented by just one session of work, and this necessitates the \"Tessellation\" session header in a way that perhaps other session headers themselves still fall short.\nThe piece offered here recalls one of my favorite moments in both ambient music and video gaming - the inexplicable comfy sofa that periodically appears throughout the labyrinthine castle in \"Ico,\" which serves as a save point when the title character and his mute companion Yorda relax on it. In this moment, and only in this moment, a very pretty fluttering ambient melody weaves through the air, and loops until you leave the sofa and move on, and I am certain that I was far from the only player to find this simple moment so comforting and safe that I just sat on my own real-world sofa and let it play for long periods of time.\n\"Tessellation\" feels very similar, texturally and melodically, to this save point moment in \"Ico,\" although this was more of an incidental thing that happened naturally in the session, with the first two takes being in the more \"alien\" tongues of Lydian and Dorian, while this beautiful simplicity waited until the third take to arrive in the major pentatonic. Often, I will have a very firm grasp on the timbral and pacing aspects of a patch, but the melodic profile that feels \"correct\" for lack of a better term takes several different passes to locate, and always the clear choice is made evident when it happens - it is almost never something I struggle with as a later decision (although a recent example of this was the third \"Enantiomorphosis\" session from Vibra 99, which was recorded in two scales - a major penta and a much more esoteric TrivalentZeus7 scale - and both felt so perfect that had a hard time choosing between them, although the major penta won there too).\nAs I write this copy today, I am shivering in my usually more hospitable workshop, with the neighborhood coated once again in snow, and \"Tessellation\" is precisely the sort of music I need on a day like this, paired with the warmth of the cover photograph, which is/was an image of candelight on the wall of my living room in Columbia, South Carolina during a power outage in 2015. I hope \"Tessellation\" brings you some warmth and comfort, whether you have a safe sofa to recline upon or not.",

            "about": "THE COLOR OF AN ECHO is a quiet and minimal meditation on the consideration of absence. It is the sound of no-input audio paths on my R-EW Audioholistics modular system feeding back into and out of one another, cascading until a thick fog of monolithic sound emerges from my monitors here in the dimly lit Workshop. Like FLAWLESS AMETHYST and a couple other entries in the Vibratelepathos catalog before it, THE COLOR OF AN ECHO has been mixed at a very low volume in order to maximize the implied stillness of the sound, and to offer a more flexible option for those following the series' output for meditation and sleeping purposes. The limited edition CD-R version contains a more \"modest\" 70 minute composite that has been mixed to a more moderate volume level in order to provide a counterpoint to the softer aspect of the digital release.",

            "about": "For the 25th catalog entry in the Vibratelepathos catalog, we reach back to the beginnings of the series somewhat, and revisit The Color Of An Echo. This session from March of 2020 yielded two initial recordings, while leaving the door open for subsequent sessions to be undertaken within the same framework. This second session, recorded on the evening of March 24th, further explored the possibilities of routing a granular processor into itself, and subsequently shaping the inevitable feedback into a warm wall of head-swimming transcendent drones. Since these first two Echo sessions came to pass, the modular system has grown by leaps and bounds, and now contains additional feedback generation tools as well as different processors to sculpt it with. It follows that subsequent Echo sessions will no doubt yield more new discoveries of what is possible within the generative music ethos of Vibratelepathos recordings.",

I sat with this session for several months, enjoying the chord of the feedback wall, but feeling that there could be more to it, some kind of depth that could be conveyed without altering what was there already.\nI ended up routing the session's audio through three different pitch shifting and time stretching processors, each one affecting a unique granular perspective, which I would then reprocess with parametric equalizers, more filtering, and some subtle reverb and delay effects, all according to the prominent frequency bands that became highlighted in the pitch/time-affecting process.\nTo fully illustrate the differences in processing, one processor was actually an app on my mobile phone, another was a piece of desktop software that has been around for so long, I actually used it to edit things in highschool for my broadcast journalism class. The third was the most modern and hi-fi of the three, and yet I love all of these processors for very different reasons.\nUltimately, The Color of an Echo fulfills the purpose of the title - a deep exploration of the ambient possibilities within room feedback - while using digital fidelity itself to present wildly different takes of the same basic idea, using the same exact session recordings.\nAll of this, and still no mention at all of the emotional content of these recordings. I have no real commentary to offer, that I do not feel these sessions can convey on their own as pure sound, but I will add that I feel they are beautiful sonic obelisks, far more ornate than my very technical notes and processes might imply, much more than a simple proof of concept. However, even now, on the other side of almost nine hours of music, I still feel completely certain that I have barely scratched the surface of room feedback sessions, and the near-infinite possibilities that still reside there.",

            "about": "Time Lines is the session header devoted to recordings that explore the Doepfer A-188, a powerful and unique module that is capable of a myriad of audio and modulation usages, primarily among them Karplus-Strong synthesis (see: River Ores).\nThe A-188 is a BBD (or Bucket Brigade Delay) module, unique from the other Karplus-Strong machines in that it is analog rather than digital, with multiple variations on the module's design conveying a different timbral character through their separate delay stages. Two such A-188s are part of the R-EW system - one utilizes 256 stages, allowing for more upper-octave pitches and the other utilizes 1048 stages, effective for bass register and percussive sounds - and both are able to even be routed into each other to produce uniquely controllable feedback.\nConsidering the \"pitch\" output of A-188 is a trail of an incredibly fast delay (whose internal clock is in fact a very fast VCO), tracking accurate pitch with it via an external sequencer is difficult, rendering it well suited to strange scales that are in actuality inaccurate permutations of something as simple as a major pentatonic, although this aspect of the machine only serves to inspire new ideas rather than being thought of as a detriment, given the aptitudes of the rest of the R-EW system surrounding it.\nThis first Time Lines session will be followed by several different ones, recorded months apart, all alien and unique in their own ways, but still undeniably the A-188. In this first volume, strange melodic motifs weave around each other like trails of smoke bending in the breeze as they stream off of a candelabra. The closest analog to Time Lines, as it is presented here, is probably some of the Second Coat material made with the MS-20, which shares some design details with Time Lines in that the MS-20 was being sequenced with deliberately incorrect voltage, and conveyed weirder tonal profiles than it was meant to in a standard patching situation.",

            "about": "As I've written here in recent releases, numbers always play a very significant part in my work, and especially within procedural work where they can be used as sources of rhythmic change, probability, modulation, octaval ranges and so on. 2024 has already seen numerically significant releases issued very close to one another - Vibra 82 being a reference to the birth of my wife, Vibra 83 referring to my own birthdate - and now, Vibra 88 as well, which could only ever be one thing in this series: A study of the powerful Doepfer A-188 \"bucket brigade delay\" module.\nI've explained the way the Doepfer A-188 works before, but in short, it is an analog Karplus-Strong machine, and it exists in no less than seven variations - my modular system contains two different models - which are all different based on their delay stages. Eventually, I would like to have all seven variations in my system, but time and space are in fact finite, especially in the modular synthesis world.\nFor this second session, itself a duality of two different parts, I've put together a convoluted set of dualities. First, the voice you hear is the summation of two different A-188s - one 256 stage machine and one 1024 stage machine - tuned together in unison, or near-unison, allowing for some beautifully subtle natural chorus to happen between them. Secondly, pun intended, I have used two different scale systems in the quantization of each machine - the first plays a Mixolydian scale in F-sharp, the second plays a Dorian scale in B - and these combine in interesting overlaps that may not necessarily happen were both of the machines playing the same scale in the same key. The whole thing is modulated in unpredictable ways by Buchla's 266t - the \"Source of Uncertainty\" - and colored by the usage of two different granular resamplers, a four-head tape delay and a deep digital reverberator.\nAs per the series' usual, more \"Time Lines\" sessions exist and will follow when their...time...is right.",

            "about": "\"Time Lines III\" continues the diverse lineage of my deep love affair with Doepfer's A-188 module line, punctuating itself purposefully with this third entry exploring one of my first sessions with three different A-188 machines. The A-188s are unique synthesizers, with seven distinct variations between them, and I now happily possess three in my modular setup. Their differences are based on the amount of delay stages involved in their circuit design - the larger the number, the more delays - and for a machine that revolves centrally around feedback, these differences are more profound than they may otherwise appear. My modular system has now integrated the 256 stage unit, the 512 stage unit and the 1024 stage unit, and these three are what you hear on this release, each responsible only for a single note.\nUsing a sequencer called Piconacci in the Allen Synthesis EuroPi module (an open platform machine that runs Python coded applications on Raspberry Pi), I've sent three of the EuroPi's six outputs to each of the A-188s, with Piconacci sending these triggers at time divisions of the master clock signal based on the Fibonacci sequence - the Golden Ratio. In this composition's case, the three divisions are 21, 34 and 55.\nFrom here, each of the A-188 modules play only one note that I've tuned by ear, and three different takes were recorded of the patch. All three takes were layered over one another in FL Studio, with some relatively minor post-processing for filtering and very subtle chorusing (incidentally also based on the BBD circuits in the 188s).\nThe resultant audio showed up in my wave editor with observable Golden Ratio shaping, which really struck me, understanding just how melodic something rigidly mathematic can truly be. I reserved this session for publication in a special spot in the catalog, because it felt so profound when it was completed. At position number 98, the next to last entry before the milemarker of 100, which is a much larger singular work because of that milestone, \"Time Lines III\" is in many ways the summation of so many of my ideas that have been explored and published here in the last four years.",

            "about": "For the very special occasion of reaching the twentieth volume of the Vibratelepathos, I have assembled three extended pieces named Vision Chronograph, which were dreamy melodic sessions created as rehearsals and soundchecks for potential Vibratelepathos live broadcasts via a third-party platform that I've not used before. Initially, the Vision Chronograph sounds were only meant to convey a full spectrum of the possible audio configuration used for Vibratelepathos, almost like a sound-test record from the 1960s, but more gracefully implemented with filter sweeps, panning effects, gradual saturation of reverberations and other delays, all stemming from my very first synthesizer I ever owned - a Roland SH-32 digital polysynth. The sounds produced on the SH-32 were inevitably routed through my R-EW Audioholistics modular system for additional modulation and processing, and the Arturia Keystep Pro acted as the mother brain sequencer, which also contributed to some of the movements and contours conveyed through the synth itself. At the time of recording these sessions, I hadn't considered them as necessarily viable works for this series, but upon closer listening during the very cold Dayton Winter, they kept me very nice warming company. So, as Spring slowly advances closer from the bottom of the ravine behind the White Pillar Workshop, Vision Chronograph feels appropriate to celebrate with, and I hope you enjoy these pieces too.",

            "about": "'Watermark' is the first session of several focusing on sinewaves that are the result of self-oscillation in filters and phasers. These voices, being sound-shaping utilities rather than true synthesizer voices, behave differently than other \"proper\" voices, namely in the way they track pitch accurately from a sequencer. This means they are largely unreliable as tuned voices, but modular synthesis rewards curiosity, and in this way, self-oscillating filters can turn something as simple and predictable as a major pentatonic scale into something more exotic that still somehow manages to \"make sense\" melodically with itself.\nThis first session explores the \"voice\" of Stairs, a stereo \"Moog-style\" ladder filter built by After Later Audio, which includes dedicated outputs for no less than two different slopes of low-pass, a band-pass and a high-pass, along with individual modulation control of both filters and a bias control, which essentially starves the module in the amplifier path in order to elicit unique timbral behaviors from an otherwise standard filter type. Here, you will hear Stairs playing two different major pentatonic scales, sequenced by Ornament & Crime in Quantermain mode, with two of the low-pass outputs becoming a woven pad sound through a four-head tape delay system, and the remaining outputs being processed pointillistically through a Buchla Quad Lo Pass Gate, receiving timing information from a Gate Phaser program in Allen Synthesis' EuroPi module, developed with the compositional approach of Steve Reich in mind.\nAltogether, this session resembles a previous Milieu recording a little bit - \"Utaru Greenshine Caravan\" - mostly due to the pointillism of very small pockets of melodic sound that build a halftone landscape around the listener, but the pad chords beneath these events pass by like a lazy river, recalling instead things like \"Recurrent Irrigation\" and \"Leaden Monarch\" - both notably sourced from Moog machines.",

            "about": "WHITE ALICE is a new session header for this series, and debuts with a double-album set of the first two Vibra sessions undertaken with the Roland Juno 106 - an iconic and immensely versatile digital polysynth, with an analog filter.\nBefore discussing the session and its approach, I feel it is relevant to first explain that the Juno is here in the White Pillar Workshop only because a close friend insisted upon giving it to me unexpectedly after we met up for coffee this past Summer. The finer details of why my friend did this are not something I fully know, but part of my reckoning with this unbelievable act of kindness is in how I'm using it in the studio.\nHere, on these WHITE ALICE sessions, you can hear what is a deliberately careful hand, shaping the Juno only where and when I felt it necessary, and allowing the machine to breathe and express itself wherever possible. The Vibratelepathic series is designed with these types of approaches in mind, so the Juno is already well-suited to this thinking. It is truly one of the most versatile and beautiful sounding machines I've ever had the pleasure to play, and certainly one that I never thought I'd own. During these sessions, I tend to focus on reactionary decisions rather than fundamental changes, allowing pieces to flow between sections naturally, as a river might meander through different elevation levels and terrain. In this way, the Juno absolutely guides itself. It sounds and feels so certain of its path that I get a very deep sensation of the music making itself.\nOn a technical level, what you hear on the WHITE ALICE recordings is nothing more than the Juno 106, sequenced via the Arturia Keystep Pro, routed in stereo into my R-EW Audioholistics modular system and navigated in realtime via the assembled ecosystem of modulation and signal processing.\nListening to these sessions now, months later, and considering everything about them, I am convinced of the Juno asserting itself in both physical and philosophical splendor in my studio. Everything about it is emotive and distinct, bringing a surreal, unspoken familiarity with it that recalls past lives, displaced from home, exploring the natural world, getting a glimpse of a mountain top from some distance away, and suddenly knowing where you are, assured in your path, returning to the small village in the ravine that calls your name.\nWHITE ALICE, now and forever, in all variations, is for R.G.",

            "about": "WHITE ALICE is a new session header for this series, and debuts with a double-album set of the first two Vibra sessions undertaken with the Roland Juno 106 - an iconic and immensely versatile digital polysynth, with an analog filter.\nBefore discussing the session and its approach, I feel it is relevant to first explain that the Juno is here in the White Pillar Workshop only because a close friend insisted upon giving it to me unexpectedly after we met up for coffee this past Summer. The finer details of why my friend did this are not something I fully know, but part of my reckoning with this unbelievable act of kindness is in how I'm using it in the studio.\nHere, on these WHITE ALICE sessions, you can hear what is a deliberately careful hand, shaping the Juno only where and when I felt it necessary, and allowing the machine to breathe and express itself wherever possible. The Vibratelepathic series is designed with these types of approaches in mind, so the Juno is already well-suited to this thinking. It is truly one of the most versatile and beautiful sounding machines I've ever had the pleasure to play, and certainly one that I never thought I'd own. During these sessions, I tend to focus on reactionary decisions rather than fundamental changes, allowing pieces to flow between sections naturally, as a river might meander through different elevation levels and terrain. In this way, the Juno absolutely guides itself. It sounds and feels so certain of its path that I get a very deep sensation of the music making itself.\nOn a technical level, what you hear on the WHITE ALICE recordings is nothing more than the Juno 106, sequenced via the Arturia Keystep Pro, routed in stereo into my R-EW Audioholistics modular system and navigated in realtime via the assembled ecosystem of modulation and signal processing.\nListening to these sessions now, months later, and considering everything about them, I am convinced of the Juno asserting itself in both physical and philosophical splendor in my studio. Everything about it is emotive and distinct, bringing a surreal, unspoken familiarity with it that recalls past lives, displaced from home, exploring the natural world, getting a glimpse of a mountain top from some distance away, and suddenly knowing where you are, assured in your path, returning to the small village in the ravine that calls your name.\nWHITE ALICE, now and forever, in all variations, is for R.G.",

            "about": "The fourth White Alice session with the Roland Juno 106 polyphonic synthesizer was recorded on the evening of August 5th, 2021 - just over a year ago, as of this publication - and it seems to resume directly from where the drifty White Alice III left off. In the time since White Alice III, there has also been a triple-album set of Variations, issued adjacent to the Vibra catalog (see MMD062:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/white-alice-variations  ), which focused more on various methods of digital/tape degradation in order to 'weather' the otherwise pristine clarity of the Juno, and in this sense, White Alice IV takes aspects of that process into account here also.\nSession IV uses a hand-played sequence of chords and melodious lead lines as a looping base, facilitated via the Arturia Keystep Pro, and from there the passages are slowly accumulated upon themselves via the R-EW Audioholistics system, which utilized probabilistic granular samplers and multi-head delay devices to create a pleasantly disorienting fugue-like landscape. Perhaps, a little less moody than White Alice III, session IV feels brighter, hopeful and optimistic, and this feeling is something I would like to focus on with the publication of White Alice IV. White Alice has been lost at sea for some time now, and here, it returns to the continent, a bit more world-weary, but happy to come back home to this sun-kissed valley.",

            "about": "Two parts of a single session, originally broadcast as far back as October 2021, using the Roland Juno 106 in tandem with the R-EW Audioholistics system. This was one of the final sessions to be recorded before I transitioned the modular from the basement studio to my smaller desktop space in my den, in late 2021, and thanks to this fact I remember very little about the session itself, in terms of what scale may have been used or what processing chain was employed. It has been presented here as topically as possible - generative ambient music made with one of the most well-known synthesizers in the world - and for this reason alone, it fits in beautifully into the Vibratelepathos catalog, dovetailing alongside the weather's rainy shift into Autumn.",
