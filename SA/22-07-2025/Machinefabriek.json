            "about": "An album with short, playful and accessible vignettes, made with Italian classically trained guitarist Sergio Sorrentino. Within my discography, its style is closest to 'Glisten', the album I've made with Tim Catlin, yet 'Vignettes' has a lighter touch to it.\nThe press release:\nThis is an album based on the beauty of the electric guitar sound. The pure sound of the electric guitar (mainly “clean” or sometimes get a little bit “dirty” with the fuzz pedal) evokes memories, images, emotions. The harmonics, simple chords, arpeggios, single sustained notes of Sergio Sorrentino’s guitar formed the starting point of the creation of each track. Sergio recorded ideas, sketches and improvisations, which were then further processed by Machinefabriek. Mainly using the sounds of Sergio’s guitar playing as building material, he constructed short pieces that emphasized the feel of the original recordings and fleshed these out to create a series of focussed Vignettes. This resulted a playful, melodic and highly accessible album that stands out in both artists oeuvres.",

How dare they create such an immersive, atmospheric soundtrack that makes me feel like i'm orchestrating a symphony of machine efficiency. Now every other game sounds like garbage in comparison”.\n– from a gamer review of the Microtopia Demo version on Steam\nBecome the hive mind of a robot ant colony in Microtopia! Use pheromone trails to create, automate and optimize supply chains for your ants to follow. Collect resources, produce goods, feed your queen, grow your colony and fly out to expand the species!\nMore about Microtopia:\nstore.steampowered.com/app/2750000/Microtopia/\n__________",

            "about": "Originally recorded and released as a 3\" cdr in 2007, Huis was made when I was obsessively into (and influenced by) the more playfull side of the so-called 'folktronica' scene: The Books, Múm, Colleen, Tape, Anne Laplantine, etc. I just loved the almost childlike quirkiness and melancholy of these artists.\nA big reason why I like Huis, is that it contains the early beginnings of my (still ongoing) collaborations with the Chantal Acda, Peter Broderick and Aaron Martin, who all suplied instrument recordings for me to work with. I owe a lot to these amazing people.\nI'm not sure why none of these tracks appears on the compilation Weleer (Lampse, 2007) – I guess that one was already in production when I finished Huis. I'm also not sure why I waited so long with making this available digitally, but here it is. And it's quite a charmer, if I may say so myself.",

            "about": "The album 'Drawn' that I've done with soccer Committee, interpeted by other artists. Although there's a lot of different aproaches on this disc, it feels like a homogenic whole. There's intimate singer-songwriter-style tracks, as well as thick layered digital drones and raw guitar explorations. And everything in between. But there's no question that everything has a delicate touch to it, making this compilation a beautiful and exciting trip.",

            "about": "Released on cd by Nuun, 2012\nStroomtoon can be translated as ‘the sound of electricity’. The album was constructed with hours of material I recorded while experimenting with a new live setup, using an analogue tone generator and some looper pedals. The pure sines of the generator and the static and crackling sounds of that old and dusty machine gave me a nice myriad of sounds to work with, creating endless loops and textures. The original idea was to use parts of these recordings in unedited form, but playing around with these soundfiles, the end result became much more layered and detailed, while still keeping the raw energy of the original material intact.",

            "about": "After scoring Marta & Kim's short performance 'As Much As It's Worth'  (machinefabriek.bandcamp.com/album/as-much-as-it-is-worth),  they asked me to do the music for their full length piece 'Engel'. It existed already as a 30-minute version, but they decided to develop is further, and to have new music created for it. Marta & Kim's combination of contemporary dance and circus acrobatics is truly magical, and composing a soundtrack for it was a true joy. It resulted in a truly transportive performance.\nOne of the most refreshing moments in the score can be credited to Paal Nilssen-Love, the brilliant Norwegian drummer from whom I used a snippet of a live recording in the scene 'Two High Running'. After all the electronic, atmospheric sounds, his hard-hitting and playful drums are a breath of fresh air.\nAbout the performance:\n'Engel' by Marta Alstadsæter and Kim-Jomi Fischer is a performance about inner struggle, decision-making and the metaphysical. Two performers, one a circus acrobat and one a dancer, melt together in a physical dialogue through a constant exchange of weight, momentum and direction.\n'Engel' is inspired by the poetry of 'A man and an angel' in which poet/writer Toon Tellegen describes a man who is haunted by an angel. The two performers ask themselves: where are the angels of our time? Who is guiding us through the chaos of nowadays existence?\n'Engel' is co-produced by Dansateliers, Podium Bloos and Festspillene i Nord-Norge, with support from Eilertsen & Granados teaterkompani, Dansearena Nord, Scenekunst i Nordland and Fond for lyd og bilde.",

            "about": "Original soundtrack for a film by Mike Hoolboom. Released by Important Records.\nAlvin Karpis (born Albin Francis Karpowicz; August 10, 1907) was one of the most notorious bank robbers of the twentieth century. He was named public enemy number one and arrested by J. Edgar Hoover in 1936. He was sent to the recently formed Alcatraz penitentiary, where he became its longest serving prisoner.\nKarpis was released on parole in 1969, and wrote a best-selling memoir. He moved to Spain in 1973, where he died six years later. In the last years of his life, he became an obsessive photographer, but never showed his work to anyone.",

So I’m glad the score is now available as an album.\nThe Kites performance deals with the question “What is it like to have to flee your homeland at a young age and grow up in an asylum seekers’ centre, in a ‘limbo’ between past and future?” It’s a solo dance piece, based on Roshanak’s own experiences of being on the run and arriving in a new, unfamiliar country. The subject is addressed in poetic, but at times also powerfully insistent and even euphoric ways, strengthened by visual projections and spoken texts.\nWorking with Roshanak and the rest of the team was a joy. Witnessing the choreography taking shape as the music was being (re)built and refined was fantastic, but the highlight was Roshanak’s parents visiting me, to hand me an old cassette with Iranian hit songs that the family used to play. There’s various snippets of the tape woven into the Kites music, which combines my usual abstract electronic sound world with Persian influences (without sounding too Fourth World-ish, I hope).\nOf course you’re missing Roshanak’s strong performance, and Laisvie Andrea Ochoa Gaevska’s mesmerizing video projections, but I hope the music itself will transport you to intriguing places nonetheless.\nRutger Zuydervelt, February 2023\n________\nKites premiered at Nederlandse Dansdagen, Maastricht (NL), 2021\nMore info: whttps://www.rover.company/en/kites-2/\nTrailer:  vimeo.com/632858776\n________",

Back home, I reinstalled my live setup and tried to recreate the atmosphere of said concert. Of course it turned out completely different, but the recordings of these ‘hardware jams’ were very useful nonetheless, and form the main component of the collage that is Omval. I think the result has the organic quality of a performance, with a complexity that I could never achieve in a live set.

            "about": "‘Crumble’ is full of dramatic turns, immersive drones, glitchy electronics and intimate gestures. The long form piece was made by having violin player Anne Bakker and vocalist Edita Karkoschka improvise on an electronic track, and using these recordings (and added electronics and field recordings) to sculpt a 34 minute piece.\nRutger Zuydervelt started doing music as Machinefabriek in 2004, and has released a slew of albums since. Besides operating solo (from his homebase Rotterdam or live on stages worldwide), he’s a keen collaborator, working with (electronic, jazz\nor classical) musicians, film makers as well as choreographers. Rutger didn’t study music, but graduated as a graphic designer.\nAnne Bakker studied jazz and improvised music at conservatories in Arnhem and Rotterdam, where she graduated in 2011. She regularly works for theater and dance; with John Buijsman, Kalterflug, Theatergroup DNA and Internationaal Danstheater, amongst others. Besides performing solo, Anne is also a member of the Turkish music group Goskel Yilmaz Ensemble and even performs with former Iron Maiden vocalist Blaze Bayley.\nEdita Karkoscha was born in Poland and studied Music & Education in The Netherlands. She works in the fields of music, performance and sound art, and is the lead singer of art pop band Nausica, the electonica/neo-classical group Cast Glass, and the live-cinema performance act Koschka & Heimprofi. Edita also performs and records solo as Koschka.",

The idea is to take musicians from their comfort zone, and have them experiment and think in different ways about composing music. The result is beyond my imaginations, with the 7 other musicians creating something completely new, different from their regular work, but also each with their own fingerprint. I am proud of what my friends made out of this.\nOver 4 hours of new daring music.\nSietse / Orphax",

            "about": "CD AVAILABLE HERE:\ndronarivm.bandcamp.com/album/seeker\nThis has been a long way coming. It was supposed to be released by another label, more than two years ago, but due to (financial) circumstamces it kept being pushed forward. After we finally decided to look for another label, Dronarivm jumped on it quickly, so here we are.\nIn 2012, choreographer Iván Pérez asked me to work on a score for a dance piece of his, Hide And Seek. And to do this in collaboration with the great Aaron Martin. I don't think he knew at that point that Aaron and I had been working together previously (on Cello Drowning, an EP released on Type in 2007). Living in the US, Aaron started recording parts and sending them to Iván and me. Then I would use his recordings to build the score with; processing them, editing them, adding sounds, etcetera.\nThe tracks on the Seeker album are basically (the refined versions of) the first sketches we made, trying out how our sounds would blend, and what directinos and atmospheres could be used in the dance performance. After this, these tracks were morphed into one long collage, tailored to the choreography. This final score is added to the album as a digital bonus.",

Previously self released on a double cd in 2007, with tracks 28-37 as downloadable digital bonus tracks.\nI was and still am incredibly proud and flabbergasted that so many amazing artists agreed to do a remix... Peter Rehberg, Alva Noto, Gert-Jan Prins, Lesser, Svarte Greiner and so many more... I'm glad this set is available again.",

            "about": "Back in 2011, Gerco Hiddink participated in a design contest, and made a really nice album sleeve, for a fictional album. It ended up second place, and then… well, then nothing. At first.\nWe decided to make the record real, and came up with the idea of making field recordings at four bridges, and then have four pairs (one per bridge) of improvisers react on these recordings, without being able to hear each other. The sound of each bridges was literally the link between two players.\nObviously we were stoked that we managed to assemble an amazing group of musicians: Jim Denley with Espen Reinertsen, Burkhard Beins with Jon Mueller, Mats Gustafsson with Nate Wooley and Erik Carlsson with Steven Hess.\nStaying true to the original sleeve concept, the music ended up in a super lavish double LP picture disc set, with photos (of each location of the bridges) that form short stop-motion films when spinning on a record player. Quite an (expensive) undertaking, but we managed to pull it of…\nThe LP was presented live at Worm, Rotterdam, with performances by Burkhard Beins and special guest DJ Sniff, who used the Bridges LPs as a sound source in his performance.\nThe Wire: \"There’s an obvious fascination in hearing physically distant instrumentalists responding sensitively wo the same set of auditory prompts in ways that suggest they are playing in close proximity. Beyond the artifact, Hiddink and Zuydervelt offer a conceptually viable articulation of place in an age of downloads and diminished spatial barriers to exchange communication\".\nHow’s that?\nThe LP is sold out for some time now, but the download is unlimited (and feautures the DJ Sniff ‘remix’)",
            "credits": "released September 1, 2011\nConcept by Gerco Hiddink and Rutger Zuydervelt.\nGraphic design and photography by Gerco Hiddink.\nInstrument recordings by the musicians.\nField recordings, coordination and mixing by Rutger Zuydervelt.\nMastered by Giuseppe Ielasi.\nMore info at  www.hartebeest.nl/bridges",

            "about": "First I thought I'd make this available as a free download. Then I thought it would be nice to make a 7-inch single from it. I couldnt choose so I decided to do both. Not the smartest move, business-wise, but so be it. So enjoy it for zero money, or spend some money on a sympathetic little slab of vinyl.\nThe first track of this single is an edited version of the music for the 10-minute dance piece 'as much as it is worth' by Marta Alstadsæter & Kim-Jomi Fischer. They asked me to do it (after some extra last-minute funding) a week before the première, so time was super short... but it worked out quite nicely, if I may say so. And, especially for my standards, it's a mildly euphoric track!\nThe second track is a further developed sketch of an alternative proposal for the score. It's bit less cheerful, with some noise thrown in for good measure.",

            "about": "BECOMING is the fourth dance piece by Dutch/Spanish choreographer Iván Pérez to feature an original soundtrack by Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek). After ‘Hide & Seek’, ‘Attention the doors are closing’, and ‘Exhausting Space’, the duo sharpened their collaboration with a new piece by having the music performed live on stage for the first time. The choreography and music were created simultaneously, rehearsing together, and developing a movement and sound ‘vocabulary’ for the piece. The end result is structured, but still leaves a lot of room for improvisation in order to keep a natural flow. Each performance is different, with the musician and the dancers (Wei Yun Chen, Majon van der Schot, and Christopher Tandy) having a real-time dialogue.\nThe BECOMING album release presents a version of the score which was edited from material recorded during the last rehearsel period for the piece. As a digital bonus (with the cd as well as the download), it includes a 50-minute live recording made at the prèmiere at the Operaestate Festival in Bassano, Italy.",

            "about": "Gathered Eccentrics 2008-2013, a follow-up to 'Bijeen' (Kning Disk, 2007)\nAll tracks previously released on limited editions and compilations.\nShort playing time formats like 7-inches and 3-inch cdrs are great to work with. More then on regular albums, the durational limitations are useful to experiment with and to create really focussed, cristallised pieces.\nMost of these tracks focus on a very limited palette of sounds. Hilary and Jeffery for example, are constructed using solely trombone recordings from (you guessed it) Hillary Jeffery (of the Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble). Huiswerk 1 and 2 were made using a simple setup of electric guitar and sampler. And probably a suprise in my discography are 'My Funny Valentine' and 'Oh Doctor Jesus', two jazz classics, in collaboration with bass clarinet player Gareth Davis. All these sets of songs have a very specific quality to them.\nThese tracks are among my personal favorites. Most of 'em aren't available on a physical format anymore, so it's great to gather them on the album 'Dubbeltjes'.\nThe tracks are presented as pairs or trios, as they appeared on their original releases. It's up to you, the listener, to either experience these combinations seperatly, hear the album in continuous play, or use shuffle mode to make new combinations.",

            "about": "It stands a stone's thow away from the Buiksloterweg ferry stop in Amsterdam Noord. With its rough concrete and rusting steel, the viewer fits in well here on the northern shores of the IJ. One could almost think it's always been here. But the viewer is a temporary artwork for public space, from the Amsterdam-based artist and filmmaker Sarah Payton.\nA video:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kENa7aVxMU\nYou look through the eyepiece expecting to see the central city, but instead you are offered video images of the city. Glimpses of people and buildings, neighbourhoods and industrial areas. There is music, a melancholy soundscape from Dutch artist Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek), and the voice of a woman, speaking about the the city. She speaks about things, such as a journey to another country, the properties of water, and the wizard of Oz. Of potatoes, immigrants and homeless men that she encounters in the city. Threaded throughout is the search for a story in which everyone in the city could feel at home.\n'what it seems to be / wat het lijkt te zijn' is presented in partnership with de Tolhuistuin, Stichting NDSM-werf Oost, de Overkant, M-Lab en de Zamenhofstraat ateliers. Made possible with support from the Amsterdam Fund for the Arts, the Netherlands Film Fund, Amsterdam city district North and Super-B.",

Using both 'standards' and how we can 'misremember' as starting concepts, rather than dive into the Great American Songbook, Gareth Davis and Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek) chose to use pieces of contemporary classical music as the material for their point of departure. Tiny fragments of a few notes, sometimes misremembered, from various works, became the starting sounds to create something new. Five new pieces that explore not the idea of taking a theme and making a variation but rather remembering an idea and creating something out of that memory.",

            "about": "LP available here:\ncontemporaryseries.bandcamp.com/album/foliage\n_______\nFoliage by Elliott Sharp is a long-form graphic music score that offers abstract instructions allowing for infinite possible interpretations by performing musicians.\nFeaturing a series of 80 risograph prints, Foliage is, in Sharp’s words, “a graphic score open to interpretation and realization by any instrumentalist or ensemble of any size… [it] is a piece of retinal art as much as it is an instruction set for sound, form and function interlocked.” Graphic notation, which evolved during the post-1945 avant-garde, experimental music scene, falls outside the realm of traditional music notation; it is the representation of music through the use of visual symbols. Foliage exists at the intersection of musical composition, art installation and performance – Sharp’s score is brought to life by the distinct singular interpretation of each musician who performs it.\nA central figure in the avant-garde and experimental music scene in New York City since the late 1970s, Sharp has worked intermittently with graphic notation since 1972 but began to immerse himself in the medium again a decade ago. Analogous to his use of audio editing software during live performances to modulate and distort sound, Sharp’s technique in creating Foliage was to use graphics editing software to process musical notion (that he himself composed) to distort, layer, invert, blur and ultimately explode traditionally written sheet music, in turn creating visual works of art.",

            "about": "The 7-inch lathe cut of this single\nis available until March 5, at\nstore.championversion.com/album/snoepgoed\n__________________\nOne afternoon in January, I went to the library in Rotterdam, where they have a piano rehearsal space. The acoustic piano has this system so that you can play it with headphones on. I still don't get how it works, but it does. It doesn't sound incredible, but it's not bad either. And the good thing is: besides a headphone, you can also plug in a recorder.\nSo I started improvising. I had a metronome running al the time, so that whatever I did, parts could be combined and be in sync. Not being a virtuoso, the stuff I played was ridiculously simple... But the aim was to layer things later, so it would hopefully result in something more interesting.\nThe idea was to make some sketches (for a sountrack I had to work on) use only the piano, but when fooling around with the recordings, I couldn't resist adding some sounds... and some more...\nI found out that it worked really well to double the piano with eletronic sounds. A handclap on this note, a thud on that note... This syncing of sounds is actually something I picked up from Alessandro Boseti, who does this a lot with speech and instruments.\nWorking like this, layering recordings, adding sounds, the two Snoepgoed tracks began to take shape. And it immediatly felt like two tracks that would be perfect as a stand-alone release.\nSo here it is, the Snoepgoed ('sweetmeats') single. A nice, tasty tidbit.",

            "about": "I'm so grateful that Frank Hoeve (Baldr Films) and Margarida Cardoso asked me to compose the score for the film Banzo. It's a very powerful film, beautifully shot and acted. The soundtrack holds up on it's own (I believe), but go see the movie if you get the chance.\n1907. Afonso, a doctor, arrives at Principe Island to cure servants from a cocoa plantation “infected” with Banzo, nostalgia of the slaves, who are dying from starvation and suicide. The group is confined to the forest, where Afonso decides to heal them by trying to understand what is affecting their soul.",

            "about": "After Engel and Our Arms Grew Together, dance/circus duo Marta & Kim commissioned me for another project, this time collaborating with Felix Zech and the trio Knot on Hands.\n____\nIn 'Meander' five circus and dance artists weave a visual landscape. They slide and climb over and under each other, soar into the heights or intertwine into one body. Like a new river finding its course, or like a flock of birds migrating as one body, this is how Meander was created. In this continuum of movement and rhythm, the performers highlight their mutual trust despite the frictions and fractures between each other.\n'Meander' is an ode to the process, to our constantly changing view of how we experience each other and our surroundings. By breaking free from traditional lines of hierarchy and positions of power, the five performers create a space where every moment can bring a new discovery, a new question, or a new insight.\nMeander tour dates:\ntent.eu/uk/our-agenda/?presentation=MEANDER\n____",

            "about": "For additional remixes by Matt Wand, visit:\nsmallrocks.bandcamp.com/album/prisma-appendectomy\n––––\nPrisma was released in September 2021. Since it’s so different from all my other music, I offered it as a free download. Some people liked it, some others didn’t. But for me this rhythmical experiment felt like a succes. And although I didn’t necessarily wanted to make more in the same vein (there’s already so many ideas in these 17 minutes), I felt that it could be expended somehow. So I asked a few artists the I highly admire to do a rework of the piece. Matt Wand, Nick Storring, and Phil Maguire all did an amazing job with their highly idiosyncratic takes on Prisma. The result is the album Prisma+, which is now available digitally on on compact disc.\nIn Matt Wand's words: \"two epics on the outside like bread, the Dub Tactile filling and my bits like spicy mayo and relish smeared in between the layers.\"\n––––",

In the course of 35 minutes, these floating violin tones are pulling the listener into some sort of dreamstate. The violin on Halfslaap II is played by Anne Bakker, with whom Rutger worked before on the pieces Koploop (2007) and Fabriek Bakker Fabriek (2008).\nStiltetonen (album version) is a continuation of sound piece that was composed to play continuously in a small alley in Amsterdam.

            "about": "Hardanger is a collaboration by Mariska Baars (aka soccer Committee), Niki Jansen, and Rutger Zuydervelt (aka Machinefabriek). The title refers to the instrument played by Jansen, the Hardanger fiddle. It’s a fresh addition to the established musical chemistry from regular collaborators Baars and Zuydervelt.\nThe music on Hardanger started with improvisations by Niki Jansen, guided by Mariska Baars, who responded with vocal and guitar recordings. Rutger Zuydervelt used this material as the building blocks for the two long-form pieces found on the album. These tracks are like two sides of the same coin, one a collage-like electro-acoustic piece, the other more drawn-out and contemplative.",

Seven gigs in total, which were all improvised. It was the first time we played together, and we didn't rehearse. It might not have been brilliant all the time, but there was definitely some kind of magic going on sometimes. Not knowing what the other would do, these concerts were as exciting for us as (hopefully) for the audience. Trying to do something different each time, things got weirder and weirder with each performance, up to a point where it became really hard to keep a straight face while performing. It was simply a whole lot of fun, and an experience that seems worth sharing. It made the most sense to share it in the purest way, with all concerts in unedited form, from the first one to the last. These recordings, along with a postcard set with Will's photos, form the set 'Greetings from Celer & Machinefabriek', which is available for 5 euros.",

            "about": "Following on from their debut release, 'Glisten' released by Low Point in 2009, 'Patina' is the second collaborative album by Tim Catlin, a guitarist and sound artist based in Melbourne, Australia and Machinefabriek, the nom de plume of Rutger Zuydervelt from Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nFor the creation of 'Patina', Catlin and Zuydervelt adhered to the tried and tested method of working successfully employed on their previous collaboration. Catlin made initial recordings drawing upon a wide range of approaches, preparations and techniques for guitar and electric sitar that were then sent to Zuydervelt for the addition of extra sounds, overdubs and sequencing.\nWith both artists' sharing a passion for developing upon the minutiae of the guitar, 'Patina' is an immersive album of unfurling layers of sound, acute harmonic gestures and deeply embedded drones. Throughout the course of these two long-form tracks, one can sense that the working relationship between these two artists has hit its stride. With a broader sound palette, including the introduction of field recordings and rhythmic elements being utilised to great effect, 'Patina' is an album of both gentle nuance and compelling intensity.",

            "about": "The tracks on this album might not be as old as the photo on its sleeve, but for me it sure feels like they were made in another era. There are beats, there are pop songs – hell, there are even some catchy tunes on here that you can hum along with! Characteristics that seem to have disappeared from my music.\nIt all started behind a piano, with me working my way through ‘Für Elise’. I must have been six or seven. Later, in my teenage years, it became clear that if I wanted to have some credibility, playing the guitar would be a much better option. So the piano lessons went out the window, along with Mozart, Beethoven and Bach. Time for power chords and growing long hair. I was wrapping my fingers around the fretboard and a pick, playing Metallica’s ‘One’ and other popular favorites.\nThanks to a tough-looking metalhead at school camp, I discovered death metal. I went to the library and looked up every band name I remembered seeing embroidered on this guy’s jean jacket. Carcass, Napalm Death, Gorefest, Cannibal Corpse, etc. I stepped into a world that had an obsessive (or just childish) interest in horror and gore, and I became a master in drawing unreadable band logos.\nThe next logical step was to join a band. Through an ad in a fanzine, I became a guitar player in the (not so) brilliantly named band Into Infinity. We rented a cold and moisty practise space and faithfully rehearsed every sunday, writing our own compositions and dissecting songs from our favorite bands. I clearly remember the crowd cheering when I started the opening riff of The Gathering’s ‘Strange Machines’ during our first and only gig, at the drummer’s high school, in 1996. The band existed for only three months.\nA classmate in design school was responsible for my first attempts at making electronic music. He gave me a simple software program (Fast Tracker), which I learned from the inside out within a month. For evenings on end, I was staring at the screen of my parents’ computer, headphones on, constructing beats and taping cassettes. By then, my musical taste had changed to more electronic and danceable music like the Chemical Brothers, the Prodigy and Orbital. It felt great to be able to make music like that, all by myself, with no band mates to argue with.\nDuring my study at the art academy, in 1999, I moved to Arnhem to share a house with a dozen other art students. An extremely inspiring environment. A housemate sold me his mixing board, I recorded the violin playing of another, and I got myself an electric guitar as payment for a graphic design job. My collection of hardware was rappidly expanding, and my room became a musical playground, filled with drum machines, multi-track recorders, samplers, pedals, keyboards, and guitars. I was greedily exploring every possibility within the limitations of my (mostly second-hand) equipment, finding ways to translate my musical ideas into sonic matter.\nMost tracks you’ll hear on this album were made in that period. I began to make CD-Rs, in small editions of 10 to 40. I spend hours designing sleeves, printing them in the local copy chop, and cutting and folding booklets. I didn’t really know how to sell or distribute my music, so at that time my only audience existed of my friends, and the handful of customers that bought an album in the record shop I worked at.\nAfter giving one of my CD-Rs to Kultuurhuis Bosch, the local venue, I was asked to do a concert. The idea of being on stage all by myself was way too scary, so I asked some friends to assist me with their saxophone, cello, and spoken word skills. The gig was performed as Machinefabriek – a name I had stumbled across many times, as it was mounted in big letters on a building I passed every time I went to the supermarket. Machinefabriek means machine factory. An appropriate name, but most of all, a beautiful word.\nIt was when I received a CD that I ordered on the Internet that I was introduced to Lampse. The package included a flyer from that label which caught my attention. From then on, it went really fast. I contacted the label, and a few months later (May 2006) ‘Marijn’ was released. My first official full-length album. It marked the beginning of something you could call a decent musical career.\nCompiling this album wasn’t easy. There was an great amount of tracks to choose from, on more then 40 cassettes and 20 CD-Rs. Nothing from those cassettes made it into this selection, but on the CD-Rs, I found a number of gems I had forgotten about. It was like meeting old friends again, finding out that although we might have changed a bit, there was still a connection.\nI once read that a lot of musicians that I respect started by imitating the music they loved. This was good to know, as I guess that a lot of the music on this disc might be my version of either Autechre, Aphex Twin, the Notwist, múm, Photek or Mogwai. Or all of those at once. Obviously, I still hope these tracks have enough relevance to be heard. For me they do, as a definite reminder of a stage I’ve passed, but haven’t forgotten.\nRutger Zuydervelt, February 2010",

            "about": "Piiptsjilling consists of Jan & Romke Kleefstra (Alvaret Ensemble, Kleefstra|Bakker|Kleefstra, etc.), Mariska Baars (soccer Commitee) and Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek). They combine poetry with vocals, guitars and electronics. Whether in the studio or live, they always improvise. Without much discussion, they just start, and the music magically pours out, sometimes ethereally beautiful and at other times abstract and noisy. Jan Kleefstra’s poems are in Frisian, a language most listeners won’t literally understand, but can just as well be experienced on a musical level, adding a sense of mysterious melancholy to the music.\n‘Fiif’ doesn’t so much mark a new chapter for the band, but rather an organic progression of their sound. There’s a rougher edge to it then on previous albums like ‘Wurdskrieme’ (Experimedia, 2010) or ‘Moarntiids’ (Midira, 2014), and Mariska’s vocals have gained an even more important role.",

            "about": "Doepfer Worm consists of collages from recordings\nI made during my first encounter and experiments\nwith synthesizers. I was loaned a Doepfer Dark\nEnergy, and then I spent a week at the synth-filled\nWORM studio in Rotterdam. Not having a clue about\nhow these things work, I wanted to hear what would\nhappen if I went in there unprepared. A process of\ntrial and error ensued: flipping switches, pressing\nbuttons and patching cables. It was a lot of fun.\nWhilst editing the material for this CD I tried to main-\ntain the roughness and playfulness of the original\nrecordings, to preserve an element of surprise and\nchance. There wasn’t any post processing, just a\nthorough selection process and some layering and\npanning.",

            "about": "Working together since 2009 with albums on Home Normal, Sonic Pieces, and Dekorder, the latest collaboration between Gareth Davis (bass clarinet) and Machinefabriek (electronics) is released on White Paddy Mountain. Their latest album, ‘Shroud Lines’, edited from a two day recording recidency at Studio Loos, The Hague, has grown into the duo’s most fully formed album yet. Coming from improvised sessions, it negotiates the unpredictability of the organic and acoustic process as fragments of sound turn into rich textures and melodic lines. Perhaps more so than any of their previous work, the album is sequenced as a suite, chapters of new landscapes, saturated and intertwined with found sounds and field recordings which create the overall narrative whole.",

            "about": "CD available here:\nsovnrecords.bandcamp.com/album/luchtwezen\n_________\nRutger Zuydervelt, a.k.a. Machinefabriek , needs no presentation to the ambient and drone audiences. (Hyper)active since the early 2000s, he epitomizes a minimalistic, electro-acoustic approach to these genres bringing together real world and synthetic oscillations. Berlinde Deman is a tuba player, and amongst many other projects member of the unconventional jazz big band Flat Earth Society.\nIn Luchtwezen , the two are brought together by a common veneration of the physical experience of the creation of sound. Both musicians each exploit on this record an unusual instrument: Rutger plays the Hess church organ of Oude Kerk Charlois, in south Rotterdam (together with some electronics); Berlinde sings, and plays the serpent, an ancient wind instrument, made out of wood and shaped like a snake. The meeting of the two should have taken place, as a matter of fact, in the Oude Kerk Charlois itself, during a live concert organized by Koffie & Ambacht. However, the quick rise to power of Covid-19 forced the duo to turn this get-together (as all musical get togethers during our quarantines) into a virtual one: a studio recording, that you can hear as Luchtwezen ..\nAnd yet, by just listening to the record, you may be fooled into thinking that this was a live recording - as we have all thought, because of their intensity, that some quarantine Zoom calls were not happening over a screen, but rather out there, in the real world. The flow is natural, the sound space unitary. The clicks of the organ keys are just right there in front of us. After the first brooding half, we all feel the mysterious, oriental breath flowing from the serpent in the spaces between us. And then, a simple melody sang by the organ reminds us of the feeling of excitement of going to a live concert - where you know that a serpent will dance to the sound of the organ's pipes",

            "about": "LIMITED LATHE CUT AVAILABLE HERE:\nsklep.gusstaff.com/goncalo-almeida-rutger-zuydervelt-eventual-vinyl-clear-180g-limited.html\n____\n‘Eventual’ is the first album by double bass player Gonçalo Almeida and ’knob twidler’ Rutger Zuydervelt. It’s not exactly their first collaboration though, having released two EPs, ‘Doze Ruinas’ and ‘Jangadas’, and being colleagues in Hydra Ensemble (with cellists Lucija Gregov and Nina Hitz).\nWhen film maker Lex Reitsma commissioned Rutger Zuydervelt for the soundtrack of his documentary about photographer Koos Breukel, Zuydervelt proposed to involve Gonçalo Almeida. Reitsma agreed and visited Almeida to record a selection of double bass improvisations. The plan was for Zuydervelt to weave these recordings into the score, but in the end not much of it was used.\nBoth Almeida and Zuydervelt felt that the wealth of recorded material was too beautiful to lay to waste, and since they had plans to create more music as a duo anyway, it was logic step to give this session a new purpose.   After a few false starts (and more than a year after the recording), Zuydervelt found a successful angle and constructed ‘Eventual’; a long-form drone composition, created by combining multiple edits of Reitsma’s recordings, and making use of the gorgeous harmonics and overtones of Gonçalo’s playing.\nWhile Almeida is also a master in furious skronk, ‘Eventual’ highlights his more minimalistic and patient side, combined with the detailed and multi-layered sound design by Zuydervelt. The icing on the cake is the beautiful mastering by Jos Smolders.",

            "about": "The plan for + arose from being a young parent, and dealing with the combination of working on music at the same time. Focusing on long-form music proofed challenging. So I came up with the idea to work on super short tracks that each could be made within a short span of time, and to do this with ‘a few’ collaborators. This concept worked out brilliantly (especially because of the enthousiastic responses from the artists I invited to join), and in no time the project grew a lot bigger than anticipated.\nSo, + is a selection of no less than 52 short pieces, each with a different collaborator. The variety is huge, with jazz cats, electronica wizards, classical players, and more.\nEach contributor was asked to send a one-minute recording. No other guide lines were given (because I love surprises). These submissions were then treated/reworked into the audio miniatures you’ll find on the album. And it’s safe to say that these tracks are all over the place, stylistically.\nNext step was to sequence everything into a more or less coherent album. It’s up to the listener to decide if that mission was accomplished. But it surely is an intruiging trip.\n_",

            "about": "cd available here:\nglacialmovements.bandcamp.com/album/stillness-soundtracks-ii\n_______\nPress release:\nThe friendship and collaboration between Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek) and Alessandro Tedeschi (label founder of Glacial Movements, has been going on for several years now and it is constantly evolving. The Dutch artist, in addition to carrying out the graphic designs of all Glacial Movements' releases, is also part of the label’s catalog with the album \"Stillness Soundtracks\" released in April 2014. Almost 6 years from its publication, here is the new musical tale of the fantastic journey in Antarctica by Esther Kokmeijer.\nWhen Esther Kokmeijer asked Rutger Zuydervelt (aka Machinefabriek) to score the second installment of her ‘Stillness’ video series, he didn’t have to think twice. After all, when working on its first volume, the duo found out soon enough that the images of floating icebergs and desolate sea scapes were a perfect fit with Rutger’s glacial sounds (as heard on ‘Stillness Soundtracks’). For that first set, the score was quite lively and layered, as if the music was adding a narrative to the static imagery, suggesting that things were unfolding outside of the screen. For the second ‘Stillness’ installment, the focus is more on what can be seen within the frame – an attempt to capture the solemness of the images – to find beauty, but also sadness in the mesmerizing quality of Esther’s films. This makes ‘Stillness Soundtracks II’ a more sombre and subdued album and one that’s a fitting soundtrack to these alarming times with climate change being a more serious threat than ever.\nEsther Kokmeijer: “Stillness” depicts tranquil, gliding images of icescapes from the North and South Pole. I filmed these landscapes during my biannual visits to Antarctica as an expedition photographer. The meditative images invite reflection on the unparalleled beauty of this glacial ecology, which appears both vulnerable and resilient.”\nRutger Zuydervelt:\nTrained as a graphic designer, Rotterdam's Rutger Zuydervelt started releasing as Machinefabriek in 2004. In 2006 he released his first official full-length album, 'Marijn', which was voted by the Wire as one of that year’s bests electronica albums. Since then, his discography has expended rapidly, releasing on international labels such as 12K, Staalpaat, Important, Experimedia, Type, Home Normal, Dekorder, and Glacial Movements. His improvised live performances has seen stages across the globe, including Japan, Canada, Russia, and Israel. Besides making albums and playing gigs, Zuydervelt regularly works with film makers and choreographers, as well as producing on installations.\nEsther Kokmeijer:\nEsther Kokmeijer is an artist, explorer, designer, and photographer, currently residing in Rotterdam and working around the globe. From 1996 until 2001 she studied graphic design at the ArtEZ Institute of the Arts. Between 2001 and 2008, she managed her own design studio, besides working as a (travel) photographer for magazines and newspapers. Since 2008 she has worked as an independent artist. For some of her projects, she collaborates with scientists and other professionals. In 2013 she studied Arctic and Antarctic Science, a minor at the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (RUG). Since 2013 she also seasonally works as an expedition photographer and polar guide, sailing to the Arctic during the Arctic summer and to Antarctica during the Antarctic summer. Kokmeijer's work has been exhibited and published worldwide. For various projects, she had visited 84 countries. Furthermore, she has participated in art residency programs in The Netherlands, Indonesia, South Korea, Greenland, Antarctica, Spitsbergen, Germany, France, Mongolia, and China.",

            "about": "Amalgaam is a raw and unpolished album. Which doesn’t mean that it’s blunt or trite. The grainy, textural sounds on this record have a fleeting, cinematic quality to them, combining spaciousness with a sense of intimacy – at times interrupted by noisier outbursts. The album is based on a series of improvisations on a very hands-on hardware setup, with an old tone generator, effects pedals, dictaphones, contact mics, etc. This material was then mixed and edited into the pieces on this album, while retaining the liveliness of the source material. The only deviation is ‘Metallic (Edit)’, which is an older track that originally appeared on a Japanese compilation tape, but - especially in this newly edited form - seemed to fit between the Amalgaam pieces perfectly.",

            "about": "'Oahu' is a collaborative release between Dutch sound artists Freiband (the latest project of Frans de Waard, founder of the Korm Plastics label and member of Kapotte Muziek, Beequeen and Goem to name but three) and Machinefabriek (the prolific Rutger Zuydervelt).\nThe genesis of the project was a 90 second recording of improvised acoustic lapsteel (the Oahu of the title) played by Martin Luiten. From this initial recording, segments of music, each lasting 30 seconds in length, were created then passed back and forth between de Waard and Zuydervelt over a period of four months for further processing, editing and refinement. Finally, with a collection of 20 of these segments, each artist composed their own 20 minute mix using these pieces.\nThough the nature of processing and reprocessing applied to the initial recording of the lapsteel makes it at times almost unrecognisable, the harmonic and melodic essence of the instrument is retained and utilised throughout. And whilst unified by the source material at their disposal, these two tracks have a distinct feel and identity that manage to perfectly encapsulate the work of both artists.",

The ensemble is a juncture of four distinctive expressions finding common ground – together they form a four-headed entity that emerges from highly pensive collective improvisations, creating an intricate patchwork of concurrent melodic lines, textural explorations and expansive drones. Its sonic language exists on the cracks of free improvisation, minimalism and experimental foreboding ambience; and is as ominous and majestic as the multi-headed Greek mythical animal they are named after.",

            "about": "An adaptation from Sileen, a composition commissioned by Musica for the festival OORtreders (22 October 2016, Neerpelt, Belgium).\nSileen II was recorded in the same pitch and tempo as its predecessor, then slowed down in post-production to half its speed and one octave lower.\n----\nIn 2016 I was commissioned by Musica, to compose a piece for their sound/art festival OORtreders (in Neerpelt, Belgium), and to perform it with 50 members of a local music school. So I wrote ‘Sileen’, a piece based on three groups playing a set of swelling notes; overlapping in different combinations each time. A fairly simple score to play, but one that asks a lot of concentration from the performers (and a lot of breath for the horn players - one kid fainted during rehearsals). A recording of that performance can be found here:  soundcloud.com/machinefabriek/sileen\nI’ve been thinking of recording a studio version of this piece for a long time, and finally decided to do so, with the help of bass clarinetist Gareth Davis. I decided to not go for a big orchestral version like at OORtreders, but to approach it in a more intimate way, using only Gareth’s clarinet and some electronics for extra colour. The radio static and field recordings of the original were also abandoned, to make the whole thing more transparent and focused.\nCompared to the busy, slightly chaotic performance in Belgium, this new version is almost intimidatingly sparse, even more so ‘cause at the last minute I decided to slow down the new version to half its speed, which gave way to more details like intriguing overlaps and beating frequencies.\nThe structure of the composition is very simple. There’s three groups, and each have 4 or 5 sets of repeated chords of exactly one minute - fading in and out like a wave. Each set of repetitions is followed by a silence of the same length before presenting the next set. Since the amount of repetitions is different for each group (2, 3, and 4 times), the overlap shifts and differs each time.\nMore then forcefully composing a beautiful piece of music, the structure of Sileen II is more about simply presenting these different, isolated combinations of tones. When all the options are heard, there’s a point where all group have a minute silence at the same time. Then the peace ends with a final (long) chord. I guess that finale is my composite touch to an otherwise automated composition.\nWhile the original Sileen piece was written for a big group of musicians, I wanted this new version to be more compact and focused. I started with creating the piece with electronic sounds, and then ask my regular collaborator Gareth Davis to record the different notes of the piece, for me to have a library to work with, and to add a more human touch to the composition.\nOriginally, the piece was actually half it’s length (and an octave higher). After spending some time mixing Gareth’s bass clarinet with my electronic tones, I still wasn’t convinced. It was felt hard to actually turn this into a piece that was pleasant or intriguing enough for me to listen to. I really liked the systematic aspect of the composition, but despite the slowness of the piece, it still felt too hushed and uncomfortable. But then a too-simple-for-words idea came to the rescue. By simply slowing the piece down to 50% I suddenly felt the click. This was it. Now the chords where sustained long enough for the listener to actually engage with them, to have time to sift through the different tones, focus on the beating timbres or simply ‘float’ on tone-clusters. Lowering the pitch also gave the piece a much warmer and deeper sound. Great how such a simple intervention changes so much. The piece was finished.",

            "about": "Driven by my love for solo albums by drummers and percussionists like Jon Mueller, Wil Guthrie, Nick Hennies and Burkhard Beins, I've made Drum Solos. It's my take on a solo drum record, despite the fact that I lack the talent to hit a steady beat or a play a drum roll. Instead, I used the sounds of a drum kit as a sounce for further processing.\nI booked a rehearsel room with a drum kit, and recorded as much sounds as I could in one afternoon. Hitting, bowing, stroking, whatever ways I could find to create sounds, I recorded. And these soundfiles were chopped and screwed til it sounded like what you hear on the album.\nEach track focusses on one part of the drum kit. I like to think that purposefully employed limitations like that make me more creative, and my work more focussed. It's part of the aim to make my music as minimalistic and 'pure' (whatever that may be) as possible. In this case it resulted in a short but varried and at times meditative album that might not have any virtuoso drum acrobatics on it, but shows its quality on a more subtle level.",

            "about": "The ‘Sahara Mixtape’ album presents a selection of 33 pieces made for the score of the VPRO-produced travel/documentary series Sahara, in which Bram Vermeulen explores political turmoil, social issues and cultural heritage in the Sahara region. The soundtrack is at times brooding and gritty, but also prominently playful and exhilarating. You might actually hear some influences by M.I.A., The Bug or Equiknoxx Music in there… high-energy music that you'd normally not associate with Machinefabriek. Making this album felt like an invitation to experiment in ways that were (relatively) new to the composer; the joy of making it radiates through these tracks.",

The invitation from Nomad Exquisite to record a release for the label was the push I needed to commit (or surrender) myself to this feeling shape it into music. Before I could think of an action plan, these songs seemed to form themselves, as if they already knew what they wanted to be.",

            "about": "Machinefabriek makes a long and welcome return to Champion Version after 5 years with Ver(pulver). The A side contains 'Verpulver' a slow-burning, meditative piece that builds a sense of unease through its subtle layers of sound. The composition is sparse, focusing on the gradual accumulation of low-frequency drones and faint, crackling textures. These elements seem to disintegrate as they evolve, mirroring the process of decay or the disintegration of matter. As the track progresses, there are moments where sounds almost seem to fall apart or collapse, creating a feeling of dissolution. In contrast, the second track, 'Pulver', offers a more direct, intense approach to the theme of destruction. This track is more abrasive and active in its sonic palette. It begins with a throbbing, rhythmic pulse that quickly evolves into a rich, textured composition. The sharp, percussive elements in 'Pulver' simulate the harsh impact of something being shattered or ground down. Industrial-like drones and distorted frequencies clash against one another, creating a dense, chaotic atmosphere that feels urgent and unsettling. The track might feel like a sonic representation of physical destruction, with layers of sound building and disintegrating in rapid succession. The two tracks here exemplify Machinefabriek's talent for using sound to evoke abstract, existential themes.",

            "about": "How does a future dominated by rising water feel and sound? The installation Pavlopetri, by Siba Sahabi and composer and sound artist Rutger Zuydervelt, delves into the relationship between the Netherlands and rising sea levels.\nProjections indicate a significant rise in sea levels over the coming centuries. The title Pavlopetri references the ancient Greek underwater city that rests at a depth of four meters on the seabed. Sahabi and Zuydervelt pose a poignant question: what must we do to prevent Amsterdam – which currently lies two meters below sea level – from becoming the next Pavlopetri?\nThis pressing question is embodied in an installation standing four meters tall with a ceiling at two meters, integrating various visual and acoustic properties of water. The golden, reflective exterior and open design of the installation engage in a dialogue with the surroundings.\nInside the pavilion, Zuydervelt’s soundscape evokes an underwater world.\nPavlopetri was commissioned by Stichting NDSM, and was installed at the NDSM from NDSM, Amsterdam 26 May until 31 August 2024.",

The aim was to record a track inspired by the environment, and our experiences there.\nPiiptsjilling tracks are always improvised on the spot, which is the only way we can work. So instead of focussing on one composition we ended up with multiple hours of material. I'm sure Martin Heyne, who was recording, thought it was quite strange... before playing we don't really speak much. We just start. And it always works.",

This release presents an edited version of that score, tailored to the album format.\nThe starting point of the 'Our Arms…' soundtrack was a series of home recordings that Marta and Kim made on my request. As the performance deals with their (romantic) relationship, it made sense to incorporate their daily lives in the music somehow. There’s the purring of their cat, a boiling coffee-pot, the chickens they keep, their wind chime, and much more. These intimate sounds are paired with glowing synth pads and vintage rhythm boxes. I think it definitly sounds more ‘synthy’ than you’re used to from me. There’s even a track (you can guess which one) that we dubbed ‘Blade Runner music’ when working on it…",

            "about": "This isn’t a regular ‘original film score’ album. After working on the sound design and music for Joke Olthaar’s slow-paced BERG film, Hugo Dijkstal and Rutger Zuydervelt (aka Machinefabriek) decided to re-arrange the sound into one long 30-minute piece. In the film, Hugo’s auditory magic is blended with Rutger’s minimalist drones to create an immersive bed for director Joke Olthaar and cinematographer André Scheuder’s striking black and white footage of the Slovenian Triglav mountain range. To best translate the experience into a sound-only piece, the duo decided to create a new aural adaptation of the film by editing the foley and score into a new longform composition. So despite the fact that you might not call this an ‘official’ soundtrack album, the meditative quality of the film is accurately preserved. ‘A movie for the ears’ might be a trite description, but it definitely applies to this audio journey.\nThe second track of the album is a different beast. Created in a much earlier stage of the BERG film, it was an attempt to create a soundtrack with guest Peter Hollo (Tangents, FourPlay String Quartet, raven) on cello. Peter and Rutger were in contact for years already, but this was their first time working together. Inspired by Joke Olthaar’s ideas about her film and what its music could embody, Peter recorded a few cello improvisations from his hometown in Australia. These recordings were re-edited and combined with Rutger’s electronics, into a half hour piece that served as a proposed base for the movie’s soundtrack. Compared to the first track on this album, BERG (score sketch) is a much more dynamic and (relatively) dramatic affair. Further in the working process of the film, it was decided that the music needed another direction – a more minimal approach was needed, an approach that was more about adding texture and very subtle colour, and blending seamlessly with Hugo Dijkstal’s mix of nature sounds. Luckily, the piece with Peter Hollo is preserved here on this album, because as a listening experience it’s a very welcome inclusion to this album.",

            "about": "“I did this piano/Rhodes recording, played live, without overdubs. I believe your approach to sound could match very well these tracks….”\nThat’s how Giovanni Di Domenico’s collaboration with Rutger Zuydervelt started, though the first seeds were planted when the duo did a short live improv together in 2019, and Giovanni joining Hydra Ensemble on stage in 2022.\nPainting a Picture / Picture a painting is -as the title suggest- an album of two long-form pieces, swapping the working method for each - one takes Giovanni’s recordings and has Rutger processing and adding to it, while the other one started with Rutger creating its foundation (with manipulated sounds of the first piece), and Giovanni building upon it. This resulted in two meandering tracks that are clearly linked, like two sides of the same coin.\nThe cover, a painting of an empty canvas, is made by Christiaan Kuitwaard. A beautiful and ultimately fitting visual addition to this mysterious release.",

            "about": "Note: both the download and the cd include the live recording 'Deining Live at IFFR 2016' as a digital bonus.\nThe Dutch word 'deining' (pronounced \"dining\") translates to 'heave' and also 'commotion'.   For Deining, I asked violinist Anne Bakker to bow each string of her instrument while sliding slowly from the lowest note to the highest, for exactly five minutes, as fluently as possible. Obviously, it turned out nearly impossible to do this really smoothly, but the unavoidable irregularities are a welcomed bonus. Anne also recorded the same procedure in reverse, following the strings from the edge of the fingerboard to the top nut of the instrument.\nThe piece is divided in four sections, each focusing on one string, and layering its recordings. The upward and downward glissandi form constantly fluctuating, complex combinations of tones, emphasized by manually-controlled sine waves that follow the pitches of the instrument. In the middle of each five minute section, the violins and sines hit the same note, which is then ‘frozen’ and continues as a separate, constant drone for the duration of the piece. The final low notes of each part are also held, adding an extra layer and playing a calm, minute-long drone before the next section begins.\nSome subtle radio static and pitched-down viola recordings were added to the mix for extra flavor. The taste is still a tad bitter though.",

            "about": "This album presents the score for a light and juggling performance by German circus artist Kolja Huneck. Inspired by the repetitive motions of Kolja's performance and the round discs used in it, the music is constructed using only loops; short repeated fragments that are layered in a slowly morphing sound tapestry. The sound world that’s created is as playful as it is enchanting.\nThe performance itself is contemplative walk through a world of shadows and colours. In this mix of contemporary circus and installation art, a synaesthetic environment is created by using light and colored translucent discs. The title CM_30 refers to the props used in the performance, each 30 cm in diameter.\nMore info about the performance:  kolja.art/cm_30",

            "about": "For the CD, visit:\nnewwaveofjazz.bandcamp.com/album/vistas\n____\nIf anything, the Hydra Ensemble illustrates how intertwined some presumably distinct music styles and scenes have become in recent times. Looking only superficially, one might expect a merger of the worlds of classical/chamber music with jazz and electronics, and while that is surely not a misconception, there is much more going on than that. Their debut album Voltas that was diverse, subtle and daring, exploring a musical hinterland of rhythmic, textural and temperamental possibilities. But honestly, anyone familiar with these musicians could have seen that coming.\nLucija Gregov and Nina Hitz are hardly your ‘classical’ cello players, slipping in and out of the worlds of contemporary music, free improvisation, sound exploration and arresting sonic landscapes with effortless glee. As one of the most productive artists in the Netherlands, Rutger Zuydervelt (often using the pseudonym Machinefabriek) dabbles in experimental electronics, electro-acoustic turmoil and minimalism, securing a place for electronic music in a breadth of contemporary loci. Gonçalo Almeida is among the most eager and versatile bass players of the moment, eagerly switching from maximalist jazzcore to refined solo explorations and basically anything in between.\nThe starting potential is already enormous for this international quartet and it takes them only a few minutes to transcend it, as the first piece sets the tone. The bass lays down a pulsating heartbeat, foreboding in its rhythmic insistence, while the cellos add ominous layers of sound and texture, and Zuydervelt’s electronics functions as a subtle wild card, coloring the shades, thickening the atmospheres, commenting with manipulations. The genre borders, if they were ever relevant, disappear completely in the second half, the ominous drones turning into something downright terrifying.\nThe subsequent pieces further stress the subtle interrelations in this patchwork of hissing sounds, trancelike details, rotating effects and darkly melancholic music for imaginary films. The cumulative strength of the third piece sets up a nearly suffocating intensity, while the long bow strokes of the fourth gradually evolve into a spacious sound painting. Like Voltas, the album ends with an ultra-dynamic final chapter, a compact exercise in nuance that explodes with energetic rays of greys. The most striking thing about it all is how these four people with four different nationalities (Kroatian, Swiss, Portuguese, Dutch) and backgrounds turn Vistas into something wholly convincing. It is a rich, bold and rewarding statement that not only betrays a healthy disregard for genre conventions, but also creates a strikingly refreshing balancing act, and as such also offers a new shade to the steadily expanding New Wave Of Jazz-catalog, where improvisation, minimalism and various other strands of experimental music can converge and invite curious listeners. Keep your ears open and they will be rewarded.\nGuy Peters, 2022",

            "about": "It can be breathtaking when musical chemistry pays off, and this sophomore full-length from British experimental clarinettist Gareth Davis and Dutch drone veteran Rutger Zuydervelt is an apt testament to this. The two musicians initially collaborated on just a handful of tracks, but an epic four-hour improvisation bore so much musical fruit that the two musicians were saddled with not one but two full-length records.\nAs the second of the two records (after the recently released ‘Drape’), ‘Grower’ has a lot of ground to cover, as both a companion piece and an extension to the debut album. Luckily it exhibits a welcome evolution of the sound, as the musicians seem to gel more and more competently throughout. The tone and character of Davis’s clarinet is clear from the outset, but apart from this easy signifier it can be difficult to hear exactly what each artist is doing. Zuydervelt’s subtle processes and tonal work is perfectly matched with Davis’s breathy tones and the sound is frozen in a cloud of dense ambience. The easiest comparison would be to Supersilent horn-smith Arve Henriksen, who’s intoxicating solo work has entranced so many – Davis’s animated clarinet playing, while in no way imitating Henriksen’s, shares similarities in both soul and the memorably eerie resulting sound.\n‘Grower’ is an album which manages to straddle various disciplines; elements of jazz and post-classical music are bundled up in-between fragments of the disparate drone and avant garde scenes. That Rutger Zuydervelt and Gareth Davis managed to emerge with a coherent and deeply moving album is a reflection of their restraint and subtlety as musicians. ‘Grower’ might just be that, an album that develops and changes with every subsequent listen, so give it the time it deserves to mature.",

It could have something to do with the density or porosity of organic compounds perhaps? In any case, I do think it somehow fits the sounds on this album. Sounds indeed, not songs. Anyone familiar with my music knows my interest in anything crackling, fizzling and buzzing. For Texturalis I choose to work on just that; not to be bothered with creating elaborate compositions, but to focus on creating intriguing textures. This resulted in 18 two-minute vignettes. Each of these could be a glimpse of a continuous sound environment.",

            "about": "The cd version of this release is available at\nkesh.bandcamp.com/album/machine-rooms\nIn 2007 newspaper printer Trouw moved out of their building at the Wibautstraat in Amsterdam. After that the office block, built in 1969 by Van den Broek en Bakema architects, became a restaurant and a venue for converts, club nights and events. On April 19th 2012, the event Hear It! #2 was organised by Amsterdam renowned Stedelijk Museum. I was asked to participate by ‘doing something’ with a machine room in the basement. The machines that controlled the heating and air conditioning throughout the building were still in working order. I composed the piece Kamermuziek, which visitors could listen to while strolling around the pipes and cauldrons of the dim-lit space. The sound of the machines would blend and get into a dialogue with the soundtrack playing through their headphones.\nWhen I visited TrouwAmsterdam (as it’s now called) for the first time, I had access to two connected machine rooms. Due to safety regulations I could only use one of them for the Hear It! event. Also, only eight people at a time were allowed in the room, under guidance of an usher and myself. So despite the big interest among the visitors, many weren’t able to experience the ‘tour’. Photographer Sanja Harris was one of them. We got into a talk, and that’s when the project got wings...\nInspired by the event, Sanja and I developed new ideas to translate the experience of the Kamermuziek installation to a work that was not restricted to the actual machine rooms. We were kindly given permission to make new sound recordings and photographs, which resulted in an audio-visual project consisting of a cd, a series of cards, two downloadable videos and a pdf document.",

            "about": "CD available here:\ncloud-chamber.bandcamp.com/album/in-spoar\n—\nSince 2008, Mariska Baars (vocals, guitar), Jan Kleefstra (words), Romke Kleefstra (guitars, bass), and Rutger Zuydervelt (electronics) have been creating improvised soundscapes with Frisian poetry. ‘in spoar’ is their sixth album, after releasing for labels such as Midira (Germany), Spekk (Japan), and Experimedia (US).\nLike all other Piiptsjilling albums, ‘in spoar’ is based on “live in the studio” (a church in this case) improvisations. But this time, cause of failing public transport, Mariska wasn’t present. Her vocal contributions were recorded at home, and later edited into the mix. This, together with Mariska’s continuous voice training, might have contributed to the strong sense of urgency of her vocals on this release. A great combination with Romke and Rutger’s dense clouds of sound, and a beautiful counterpart to Jan’s spoken lyricism.\n—\nMariska Baars operates as soccer Committee, and has released various albums on Morc Tapes. She creates hauntingly beautiful minimalistic songs.  soccercommittee.bandcamp.com\nJan Kleefstra writes Dutch and Frisian poetry, with multiple books under his belt. Together with Romke Kleefstra he regularly works with (international) poets, visual artists and musicians. Besides Piiptsjilling, the Kleefstra brothers were active in groups like Alvaret Ensemble and Kleefstra|Bakker|Kleefstra. Romke also has a long-running duo with Anne-Chris Bakker, Transtilla.  kleefstrabros.bandcamp.com\nRutger Zuydervelt records and performs (mostly quite abstract electronic music) as Machinefabriek, has released numerous albums, and creates music for film and dance projects for a living.  machinefabriek.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "15/15 was commissioned for the 32-speaker system Soundpiece, which is installed under the floor of the square. With the sound source being invisible for the listener, playing music on this system has something quite magical, as if the sounds are just floating in the air.\nInstead of ignoring or (to the contrary) overpowering the existing sounds, I decided to make it more like a dialogue. I wanted to keep space in the music, and to have the environment play a part in it. The sounds I’d be using would be as pure as possible - sharp and focused, in contrast to the messy soundscape that’s already there.\nI wanted the sound piece to be continuous, meaning that it shouldn’t be a song with a beginning or an end, but something that’s looped infinitely, creating an atmosphere rather then a composition. I took 15 minutes as a timeframe. It seemed like a good duration, considering the time people will be on the square. So, I settled on a fifteen-minute loop.\n15/15 takes fifteen sine tones with frequencies ranging from 150 to 9000 hertz, which are repeated at different intervals. For example: every 15 seconds a 150-hertz tone is repeated, every 60 seconds there’s a 600-hertz note, and every quarter of an hour (900 seconds) a 9000-hertz tone is repeated. At every fifteenth minute, everything comes together, marking the next cycle in the loop.\nThis might all sound a bit mathematical, but it’s a quite simple structure. The result sounds a bit like wind chimes in slow motion. Listening to it has the same effect as watching a water stream or a campfire. It doesn’t seem to change much, but it does have a strange hypnotic effect.\nWhen listening back to this piece I suddenly realized 15/15 ’s resemblance to Brian Eno’s generative composition Neroli. This didn’t happen intentionally, but it’s probably not a coincidence either. After all, its dialogue with the environment makes this a piece of ambient music in the most Eno-esque way.\nWith its slow pace, 15/15’s tight structure seems in contrast with the seemingly disorganized sounds on the square, but it blends in, creating some order amidst the noise by providing a framework for it.",

            "about": "The soundtrack for Dutch/Belgium/Italian coproduction Porselein (Porcelain), a psychological drama by Jenneke Boeijink.\nBesides the music that ended up in the film, this album contains 12 extra tracks that didn't make the cut, but are still worth hearing.\nA prominent contributor on this album is the amazing cello player Francesco Guerri, who performed with Carla Bozulich, Jessica Moss, William Parker, and many more. Check out his Bandcamp page:  francescoguerri.bandcamp.com.\nPorselein premiéred in Dutch cinemas from March 12.\n______\nThe lives of Anna, Paul and their young son Thomas look perfect – from the outside. Paul has a well-paid, demanding career, Anna has a studio at home where she works with porcelain and Thomas is a angelic child. They have money, friends and each other. But when Thomas bites one of his friends at school, the first cracks appear in the glossy exterior of this 'perfect' life.\nIt marks the start of a long, frustrating search for the cause of their son's aggression: a process that mercilessly exposes the frailties they each carefully hide and prompts the parents to take desperate measures – even calling in the help of an almost complete stranger.\nJenneke Boeijink's fiction feature debut builds the tension painstakingly from the start; from the very first moment the camera zooms in from high above Rotterdam's multi-storey housing to this family's house. The psychological drama carried by actress Laura de Boer, Flemish actor Tom Vermeir and young Neathan van der Gronden demonstrates just how fragile happiness can be.\n______\nPorcelain is a film by Jenneke Boeijink\nWritten by Jenneke Boeijink and Thibaud Delpeut\nProduced by New Amsterdam Film Company\nCo–produced by Verdeoro and Wrongmen\n______",

            "about": "I started with Sneeuwstorm by making an electronic 'framework' for the saxophones, mainly using recordings from electrical equipment, made with coil pick-ups. Then I asked two of my favorite saxophonists, Colin Webster and Otto Kokke, to improvise on the material.\nOnce I received Colin and Otto's contributions, things began to fall into place rapidly. As expected, they came up with something splendid. It inspired me again to morph the whole composition into something new, restructuring, processing and looping parts of Colin's and Otto's recordings, and adding more sounds of my own, such as field recordings, samples and electric guitar.",

            "about": "CD and LP available here:\nlaaps-records.com/album/ii\n_____________________________\nFEAN II is the following of the first opus released on Moving Furniture Records in 2018, from some materials of the improvisatory collective FEAN based around Jan Kleefstra (voice, poems), Romke Kleefstra (guitar, bass and effects), Mariska Baars (vocals) and Rutger Zuydervelt (electronics) from Netherlands, joined by the Belgian musicians Annelies Monseré (church organ, keyboard), Sylvain Chauveau (tuned percussion, radio) and Joachim Badenhorst (acoustic and amplified clarinet, bass clarinet, saxophone). Like The Alvaret Ensemble, this project is the result of some improvisations in a Church. But at not the same place.\nThe FEAN project gets its inspiration from the ecological decay of peatland in the Dutch province Friesland and in other parts of Europe. Agriculture and peat extraction are threatening the landscape severely and with long term consequences. This forms the underlying thought for the improvised recording sessions, which were overseen by Jan Switters. Although the Piiptsjilling members are obviously used to perform and record together, adding the three Belgian guests (who didn’t play together before) added an extra dimension to the group’s dynamics, resulting in a concentrated yet playful series of improvisations, that were later mixed and edited for the project.\nFor laaps, that’s was an obvious choice to continue the exquisite corpse project with FEAN and a part of the same members than the first release, just before to move to the Spring season and some news bridges, colors and sounds imprints to come.",

            "about": "CD available here:\nmovingfurniturerecords.bandcamp.com/album/fean\n______\nFEAN started as an musical artist-in-residence project in a little church in the Frysian village Katlyk. The group consists of Jan Kleefstra, Romke Kleefstra, Mariska Baars and Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek), who also form the quartet Piiptsjilling. For FEAN the are accompanied by Belgian guests Annelies Monseré, Sylvain Chauveau and Joachim Badenhorst.\nThe FEAN project gets its inspiration from the ecological decay of peatland in the Dutch province Friesland and in other parts of Europe. Agriculture and peat extraction are threatening the landscape severely and with long term consequences. This forms the underlying thought for the improvised recording sessions, which were overseen by Jan Switters.\nAlthough the Piiptsjilling members are obviously used to perform and record together, adding the three Belgian guests (who didn’t play together before) added an extra dimension to the group’s dynamics, resulting in a concentrated yet playful series of improvisations, that were later mixed and edited for the FEAN album.",

Using that code will do the trick.\n____\nAfter Tuimelval, Hinkelstap, Haast, Kadans, and Malheur, this is another release of rhythm-based music that's heavily inspired by the electronic music I was listening to in the 90s. Expect to find traces of Aphex Twin, Plaid, 4hero, Autechre, μ-ziq, and the likes.\nMost of these tracks originate from (sketches for) comissions for film and dance music, and are fine-tuned for this little release.\nThe title of this EP, Wrevel, means 'resentment'. Although the Dutch word sounds (to my ears at least) lighter and more poetic than its English translation, the title seems apt for the dark times we're in now... A naive thought, but maybe this release can serve as a temporary distraction.\n____",

Bijeen may not be the easiest or most logical point of entry into the Machinefabriek world, but it’s an engaging excursion across the beatless borders into noise, drone, static and circuit-breaking electronics.",

            "about": "Choreographer Daniel Linehan’s ‘The Wonder Of It All’ radiates joy and togetherness. From cerebral to wildly energetic, the piece feels like a ritual that slowly transforms into a euphoric dance party. Creating the music for this was a joy. It brought me back to the nineties, when I was discovering electronic (dance) music. That feeling of wonder and discovery seemed an apt comparative to the sense of awe that Daniel and the dancers convey in ‘The Wonder Of It All’.\nNormally (if there is a ‘normal’), the music I score for dance performances is made scene by scene, and then stitched together. But in this case the approach was different: in line with Daniel’s ideas for the choreography, I decided to make one 50-minute composition, to make sure that the whole piece felt like one continuous flow instead of a sequence of fragments. From that moment on, the dance was created in response to the music, with only a few tweaks in the score.\nSo this was a weird one, with the music pretty much finished so early in the process. It felt like I was being lazy, not working until the very end… but each time I saw the performance during its creation process, I was amazed by the magical unity that movement, sound, light, and scenography seemed to form. I guess art doesn’t always have to be a struggle.\nRutger Zuydervelt, May 2025\n___",

            "about": "When Michel Banabila and Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek) finished their first collaborative album, it felt like they were just getting started. Suprised by how fluent and natural their collaboration went, it was obvious that this wasn't over yet...\nWhile 'Banabila & Machinefabriek' was quite an abstract affair, its successor 'Travelog' is lighter, playful and rhythmic. Some moments might recall the mighty Tape, while others showcase motoric krautrock influences and subtle hints of African rhythms. All in all, this album clearly radiates the joy of its creative process and sees Banabila and Machinefabriek on the top of their game.\n'Travelog' comes housed in a full colour digipack, graced with photography by Michel Banabila, designed by Rutger Zuydervelt. It's released by Tapu Records, in collaboration with Lumberton Trading Company.",

            "about": "For the LP version, please visit:\noscarson.bandcamp.com/album/rutger-zuydervelt-and-bill-seaman-movements-of-dust\n____\nBill:\nI had been listening to a few different albums and collaborations that Rutger had been involved with. I decided to write him and see if he might want to collaborate. I was happy and excited when he said he was interested.\nIn every collaboration one needs to find a working methodology – and this slowly surfaced. With exactitude and play we built some beautiful pieces using very different methodologies and programs. The album formed more and more --- many times going through a large series of iterations, sometimes moving very far away from where we started on an individual work. I would sometimes make very complex mixes and then Rutger would cut away things, finding the most salient sections and layers… simplifying and clarifying.\nWe worked on individual finished tracks and later Rutger composed a long format mix which was quite exciting… Eventually we just had a series of numbers. I had just done an album with sentence length titles. We went for the inversion of that. Very short, four letter word titles. We arrived at Movements of Dust for the album title, after thinking about many different possibilities. We were excited that Oscarson from Germany decided to release it on Vinyl! As per the cover image design I have been doing a series of abstractions. Rutger did the actual final graphic design. We arrived at the idea of perfectly spaced font… All in all the collaboration worked quite well from my perspective!\nRutger:\nI had heard a few albums, and was very impressed by Bill’s music - it’s very intricate and refined. It might sound strange, but because of hearing this beautiful music, I felt that I wouldn’t want to touch that, and that if we worked together, we should aim for something different. We decided to go for something more rough sounding and, rhythm based. Compared to some of our other music, this might even be called our pop album ;-)\nThe making process for Movements of Dust was a blast. Most tracks would start by Bill sending me a library of percussive and melodic sounds, each in the same bpm. I guess my signature move was to fuck up these perfectly synced parts. To make it less perfect, more organic. Add a wobble to the rhythm, or break up the beat by stripping things down. I’d send the track to Bill, who’d react by adding sounds, or re-editing the piece. A song would go back and forth a few times, until we’d both be sure that it sounded finished.\nI’ll admit that in the beginning I was slow. Didn’t excactly know how to aproach this. But as soon as the first track started to take form, it dictated the way the project could progress. From there on, it all made sense, and working on the album felt like the most natural thing to do - even if it’s was our first time working together.",

            "about": "A striking collaboration took place between Belfi on drums and assorted small percussion and Zuydervelt on guitar and organ. Together they produce the 'pulses' and 'places' mentioned in the title. Organic yet partially improvised, it resembles a kind of sonic geography. The listener is taken away for a journey of mild drones, soft yet outspoken percussion. A strong release.",

In the game, the music plays continuously and is reactive to the player’s actions. This album presents the musical themes as edited tracks.\nTracks 17-26 are not included on the cd, cause they were made later, when the discs were already produced. They are included with the download though, so you're not missing out.\nTrack 26 is a variation on the track 'Wold' (as Machinefabriek).\nastroneer.space",

            "about": "On their second full-length, supergroup Piiptsjilling set out to both deepen and roughen up the pastoral and peaceful sound of their 2008 debut release. A coherent unit formed by guitar & poetry duo Jan and Romke Kleefstra as well as Machinefabriek's Rutger Zuydervelt and Soccer Committee's Mariska Baars, the band delineate increasingly dark lyrical textures resonating with nocturnal atmospheres and tactile sound-operations on guitar, pedals and various looping devices. Building on patient and immersive improvisations and working with both sonorous drones and ghostly micronoises, Wurdskrieme moves at a dream-pace, substituting linear logic with a brushwood of metaphors and emotional abstractions. The underlying feeling of a subcutaneous tension is further accentuated by Jan Kleefstra's expressionist poetry delivered in the language of his native Friesland, a province in the far North of the Netherlands. Contrasting serene soundscapes like opener \"Unkrud\" with more tranquil moments featuring acoustic instrumentation (\"Wurch\"), the result spans up a sonic space that not only represents an evolution from their earlier work, but also takes them far beyond traditional categories and conventions.",

            "about": "A score by Machinefabriek, for a choreography by Iván Pérez.\nAfter making the music (with Aaron Martin) for his piece Hide And Seek, choreographer Iván Pérez asked me to score his work Attention: the Doors Are Closing! The piece was made for Ballet Moscow, as part of their collaboration with Korzo (The Hague), for the Rusland-Netherlands year 2013.\nBefore Iván went to Russia to start working with the dancers, I made hours of raw material, mostly based on recordings of drums (which I found fitting with the concept of the piece). The last three weeks of the working process I joined Ivan in Moscow to work intensely on the music, while he was dealing with the finishing touches of the chreography. Each day the piece grew, and sound and movement got closer together.\nAttention deals with human relations in all its aspects, and especially how these function in a Russian society. It's a very physical performance that draws from agression, humilation and intimacy in equal parts. The score enhances this, making it a very intense and at times intimidating work.\n\"Zuydervelt’s sense of locomotion is more sophisticated and covers a wide spectrum of movements than it at first appears. It emanates from the tools he used to make the music, but instead of moving outwards into the arms and legs, it travels inward and stirs the brain into action.\" (Dusted)\n\"A good job all around, excellent sound (mastered by Joe Panzner) in which to wallow. I can only imagine how well it worked at Ballet Moscow.\" (Just Outside)\n\"a slightly different Machinefabriek release, but perhaps one of his most accessible and immediately engaging thus far.\" (Fluid Radio)",

You shift to\nanother time zone and bite into the sounds. The sounds you hear,\ntremble like warm air above cold sand. It may sound both comforting\nand ominously dystopian at the same time, but it always holds a\nmysterious freshness, like traces and echoes of something fleeting and barely noticeable...",

            "about": "The central concept behind Alvin Lucier's Memory Space is the representation of another time and place through the use of a new set of sounds. In his instructions, Lucier asks the performer/s to go to an environment and record by any means (notes on paper, graphics, audio recording or by memory) the sound situations that are present, then, at any later time, in a different space, attempt to recreate that situation. The purpose of the work is to avoid elaboration or embellishment, but given that any action of recreation is still relative, a process of navigation through an excess of material, it becomes an impression, on occasion strikingly clear, at other times lost in a haze, with the very attempt to avoid narrative providing one.",

            "about": "Looking for inspiration for a new live setup, I stumbled across some videos of the Korean-American improviser Bonnie Jones. She used a few guitar effects pedals, but turned upside down, with the bottom plate taken off. Pressing a plug to the pedals’ circuit board, glitchy, buzzing sounds emerged. A eureka moment!\nI screwed open some effects units, and started fumbling around with an unraveled microphone cable, attaching a needle to each copper wire, to be able to work precisely on the circuit boards, as if performing surgery on electrical equipment. From some pedals I could hardly get any sounds, but there we three (two Boss reverb/delays and a Behringer equalizer) that yielded some great popping, squeezing, and buzzing sounds.\nSince I still wasn't sure if these circuit bent pedals would work (for me) in a live situation, I used the recordings of these experiments to sculpt a new piece with. ‘Sprank’, the result, is like a more subtle sequel to ‘Kluwen’, my previous Norwegianism release. 20+ minutes of pure electronic sounds, from gentle, high-pitched drones, to nasty crackling and low-frequency pulses.",

            "about": "Sublime drone music and field recordings by Rutger Zuydervelt. 'Slovensko I & II' are best seen as a travel diary, recorded in Slovakia. RZ made 'sound snapshots' with a small digital recorder. A major influence both while recording and assembling the tracks was Chinese sound artist Yan Jun. 'Rusland' is a sound collage comprising field recordings and sections of live performances made in Russia. An incredible adventure and culture shock with long train journeys, bizarre venues and amazing people. 'The Breaking Water' can be heard as a sonic portrait of Rotterdam's famous Erasmus bridge. It includes recordings taken from both on and beneath the bridge, along with further sounds from the river that it crosses, the Nieuwe Maas. 'Floor & Radio' is a contrast to the outdoor pieces recorded for the the installation 'Licthung' in Radolfzell, Germany. Contrasted against the outdoor silence was the squeaking floor in the guest house and the distorted signal and static from the radio. Sometimes there's music in everything. Makino Takashi asked RZ to perform a score for his film 'In Your Star'. After a screening in Tokyo, a studio version was recorded. The result is 'Apollo', a sonic journey to space and beyond.",

Machinefabriek). Improvisation recordings from Gonçalo were sculpted to a series of sharp and fierce little creatures, all done in an unhealthy quick speed in order to keep things raw and spontaneous. 18 minutes of boisterous fun!",

            "about": "CD available here:  kleefstrabros.bandcamp.com/album/gau\nIn March of 2012, nearing the end of a tour together through the Netherlands and Belgium, Celer, Machinefabriek, and Jan and Romke Kleefstra gathered in a country studio, spending an afternoon improvising to record Gau. Recorded by the old hardcorerocker Jan Switters at the Landscape studios in Gauw, situated in the countryside in the midst of Friesland, the place was surrounded by green fields with idle tractors, few trees, buzzards and only massive farmhouses dotting the horizon. From the almost four hours of original studio recordings, later mixed down in Rotterdam by Machinefabriek, this somewhat more then 40 minutes, titled Gau, represents the highlights of an afternoon, with coffee and orangecake, in the isolated Frisian countryside. 'Gau' is a Frisian word that means 'in a hurry or fast', but is also the Frisian notation of the village name where the studio is located.",

And although they regularly work together in the quartet Piiptsjilling, their last effort as a duo stems from 2008, the album ‘Drawn’ (on Foxy Digitalis/Morc).\nBut now ‘eau’ is here. ‘eau’ (pronounced “oh”) means ‘water’ in French, and that’s how it sounds; like gently rocking waves of sound, or like a babbling sonic stream of fractured audio debris. It also sounds a bit like the equivalent of sunlight dancing on the ripples of a lake’s surface.\n‘eau’ is not really a song, or a composition. Well, technically it is, but it functions more like an atmosphere that fills the space. Just let it play (on repeat…) and let the sounds hang in the room - let them co-excist with any other sound that’s there. Open a window if you wish! Or, experience the trip on headphones, let these soft tones, gentle voices, buzzes and crackles tickle the inside of your skull.\n‘eau’ was mastered by the one and only Stephan Mathieu, who made this carefully crafted audio patchwork shine even more.",

            "about": "We (Michel Banabila and Rutger Zuydervelt) met quite a while ago, in our hometown Rotterdam. It felt inevitable to work together. Both restless and busy with all sorts of projects, it took a while though to truly make it happen.\nThings got more serious once we finally got together to talk about the collaboration, in September 2012. We agreed to start slow, and then really kick it off early 2013. But in all our enthousiasm, we quickly got caught up in an unstoppable workflow. Swapping files back and forth, layering and processing each other's sounds, it immediately felt like a match made in heaven. In an incredibly short, though highly inspiring time span, the album 'Banabila & Machinefabriek' was created. A 40+ minute journey through warm drones, mysterious crackling and outbursts of digital noise. Obviously, we are both immensly proud of the result.\nA preview of the album can be found here:  soundcloud.com/machinefabriek/banabila-machinefabriek",

But when Tijs van Trigt asked us to perform at his AMPsnacks event in Arnhem, we had such a blast that we decided to do some recording together. This cd is a selection of three hours of improvisation we recorded at STEIM in Amsterdam. Quite a rollercoaster I'd say!",

            "about": "Tapu presents the third album by Banabila & Machinefabriek. Whereas its predecessor Travelog had a charming brightness, Error Log is abstract and dystopian. The album is comprised of three long monolithic tracks, based on electronics and heavy sampling of acoustic instruments. Howling bass clarinet, warped voices, cinematic strings, Muppet drums and glitchy electronics are used to create a delirious sound universe. Keimpe de Jong (wind instruments), Edita Karkoschka (voice), Salar Asid (violin), Umit Sav (electric violin) and Oene van Geel (violin) all contribute their masterful sounds.",

            "about": "Shivers is the trio of Gareth Davis, Leo Fabriek (Julie Mittens) and Rutger Zuydervelt, who join forces to conjure up a surreal album of parasitic intimacy and intensity. Though the three have played and recorded together in various combinations, this Miasmah release marks their first output as Shivers and manages to pull out quite a few surprises.\nNamed after David Cronenberg's first film, Shivers the album readily adopts this concept of body horror, the fear of bodily transformation and infection--a theory and technique that Cronenberg brilliantly captures with his first film and many thereafter. An aural invader immediately travels through your earsinto your body, to infiltrate your soul with gorey supernatural sci-fi.\nCrawling through the thick sludge of Ash and into the chaotic Otomo, you’re treated with what sounds like a beyond-the-grave collaboration of Albert Ayler with Alva Noto producing the soundtrack to Transformers. From entering Rabid, a chorus of intense destructive voices blindfolded leads you to an abandoned spot amidst a buzz of florescent lights. Here you're abducted into a new life hundreds of years in the future, moving you through stumbling jazz, John Carpenter styled themes, repeating organ-beats, and Moroccan doom. The psychological and physical combine to make Shivers a collective understanding of the grotesque, fascinating, and personal. You might not be the same.",

            "about": "This album wouldn’t exist without clarinetist Gareth Davis, with whom I’ve collaborated several times. When I asked him to participate on my + album, he was working with Monika Bugajny. She got wind of my project and asked if she could join. I agreed and reworked her beautiful clarinet recording into a ghostly one-minute piece.\nApparently my concoction was convincing enough for Monika to propose another, more elaborate collaboration. Her suggestion was to use the same working method again, but this time with classical pieces as a starting point. Again I couldn’t say no, and off we went!\nDebussy, Messiaen, Brahms, Stravinsky… who would ever thought to see these on a Machinefabriek album! Well, they’re not excactly recognizable as such, but still… Monika reinterpreted eight classical pieces, beautifully played and recorded. I then stacked, cut, and manipulated the material into the tracks you’ll find on Recytle (see what I did there?): 30 minutes of moody and woozy clarinet/electronics vignettes.\nIf you’re looking for a faithful rendition of Debussy’s Première Rhapsodie, this is obviously not your go-to release. But in their own right I hope the tracks on Recytle might offer an intriguing counterpoint to their originals.\nRutger Zuydervelt, May 2023",

            "about": "Hallucine was never meant to exist. That’s to say; the initial recordings made by Anne Bakker and René Aquarius were meant for separate projects, but when juxtapositioned by Rutger Zuydervelt, their combination proved utterly intriguing. Starting from this chance encounter, the three musicians refined the composition with subtle overdubs and detailed editing. The resulting 33-minute piece is an elusive patchwork of violin, percussion, vocals, field recordings, and electronics. In Hallucine, the division between found sound and (acoustic and electronic) instrumentation is blurred into a spectral hallucination.",

            "about": "Boomkat: \"As an introductory statement 'Trouringh' serves as proof that Zuydervelt has well and truly brought his A-game to the table this time around, combining the very best of his microsound work with an explicitly tuneful instrumental element. Fizzing glockenspiel tones light a melodic causeway across a minuscule, infinitely graceful backdrop of high frequency sine tones, crackle and slow chords. It's a real keeper, definitely among the very finest of Zuydervelt's compositions. A series of more streamlined drones follows, although the overall feel is one of methodical, well thought out composition rather than off-the cuff tonal layering: 'Stofstuktoon' resonates like an orchestra of perpetually sustaining Tibetan prayer bowls, eventually sliding away into near silence populated only by a protracted static hiss. Over the course of 'Ranonkel 1' you'll hear interjections of acoustic guitar flirting with electronic signals, revealing a gradual, unfolding melodic trajectory. After 'Andermans Thuis' has dabbled in slightly more ominous waters, via what sounds like some gentle contact mic recordings, 'Ranonkel 2' offers a palette-cleansing ninety seconds of beautiful sinusoidal stretches, leading into the album's final seventeen minutes: 'Zink'; an immense, panoramic ambient piece featuring Zuydervelt's full armoury of techniques. During its first half you'll hear blurred acousmatic artefacts clashing with submerged string textures, eventually escalating into the kind of heady guitar manipulations and shimmering electronic timbres you might recall from Taylor Deupree's Northern. The finest Machinefabriek outing of 2008 by some margin - you'll be returning to that opening piece in particular again and again.\"",

            "about": "Rutger and Stephen sort of accidentally met through e-mail. A simple note regarding an ordering question for a CD led to an enthusiastic e-mail conversation and climaxed in a musical collaboration. This all happened in a very short period, both musicians being very inspired by the concept of “exchange,” as a means to cross space and time -- Rutger living in the Netherlands and Stephen in Virginia. Most of the time, when (electronic) musicians work together it’s a matter of swapping digital files. In this case they decided to do something different and sent each other a box full of (mostly non-musical, or musically non-functional) objects and recordings, with the “assignment” to make music with those objects and all as source materials. As the titles tell, we’re talking about an egg cutter, thumb piano, a broken kraakle box, rice, chocolate sprinkles, old cassette tapes, a broken 7” record, etcetera, etcetera. Both musicians made two of their own solo tracks with the box they received, and the last track was done together by Rutger adding sounds and processing to a piece started by Stephen. For Rutger/Machinefabriek this is part of his most delicate work. For Stephen, it was a new and extremely enjoyable form of long-distance collaboration.",

            "about": "\"Up for a new 7-inch Rutger?\"\nA question like that is always a nice reminder for something I really like... to focus on a short amount of music. It’s a bit like writing a short story instead of a book. There’s still something of the ‘album feel’ in there; two tracks that are closely related, both part of the same story. But there’s not the issue of having to deal with the arc or dynamics of a complete full length record. In a way, this gives me the freedom to be more explorative and playful, like you could probably hear in my previous Champion Version 7-inch, ‘Snoepgoed’, and in this new one ‘Melodrama’.\n‘Melodrama’ started by recording an online drum machine with a dodgy 4-track, then playing that back through a few effects pedals and looping bits of it. The resulting rhythm is the foundation of ‘Melodrama 1’, on which I started to arrange midi instruments onto, very intuitively. What started as something with a sort of lo-fi Autechre feel, to me anyway, became something completely different. Quite cinematic, and perhaps a bit… melodramatic? Well, I guess sometimes that’s how I like it.",

            "about": "Dauw, the great tape label based in Ghent, invited me in 2015 to do a release for them. This resulted in two 18 minute tracks, ‘Dwaal’ and ‘Wold’. Both are exercises in creating an auditory space or sphere rather than sculpting a structured composition. With its orchestral washes amidst a barrage of radio static and erratic noise, ‘Dwaal’ is the noisy brother of the two. It's a balancing act or battle perhaps between disruptive tumult and serene calm. On ‘Wold’, with its sparse piano notes spread out over a bed of subtle hiss, the serenity is left largely unadorned. Wind recordings and bird song - the piano as well as the field recordings captured during a holiday in Vriescheloo, (NL) - slowly guide the listener into an hypnotic, dream-like state.\nThe cassette for Dauw (accompanied by Femke Strijbos' beautiful artwork) was released in February 2016 and sold out quickly. Moving Furniture Records has decided to re-release it as a cd and download, adding two interpretations to the album, by Benoît Pioulard (whose ‘Sonnet' was a clear influence gor the album) and Nicola Ratti (another source of inspiration, both solo and with Bellows). The latter strips ‘Dwaal’ down and injects it with wonderful synth sputters, rhythms and bloops. Pioulard’s version of ‘Wold’ features his recreation of the atmosphere of the original using organ and guitar with mesmerizing results.",

            "about": "Piiptsjilling is a quartet consisting of Jan Kleefstra (poetry, vocals),\nRomke Kleefstra (guitars), Mariska Baars (guitar and vocals) and Rutger\nZuydervelt (Machinefabriek, electronics). The band name (pronounced\n'peep-chilling') is Frisian, also the language of Jan Kleefstra's poetry.\nEither live of in a studio setting, their music is always improvised on the\nspot. Working highly intuitively, the quartet patiently moves through\nstretches of melancholic dreamscapes, varying between abstract minimalism and dense drones.\nPiiptsjilling's first (self titled) album was released by the Dutch label\nOnomatopee in 2008, followed by the albums 'Wurdskrieme' (Experimedia, 2011), 'Moerwardt' (Midira, 2014) and 'Molkedrippen' (Spekk, 2014).\nLike 'Wurdskrieme', 'Molkedrippen' was recorded at Studio Landscape in Gau, Friesland. As always, the music was 100% improvised, with no negotiation beforehand. The result is a magical amalgamation of four performers with a mutual concentration and dedication.",

            "about": "'Glisten’ is the first collaborative release by Tim Catlin, a guitarist and sound artist based in Melbourne, Australia and Machinefabriek, the nom de plume of Rutger Zuydervelt from Rotterdam, The Netherlands.\nWhilst researching information on prepared guitar, Zuydervelt discovered the work of Tim Catlin, most notably his album ‘Radio Ghosts’ (released on 23five in 2007). Intrigued by Catlin’s approach towards mechanically prepared guitar and the engaging sound world created by this unassuming expertise, a partnership was soon set in motion.\nFor the release, Catlin made initial recordings drawing upon a wide range of approaches including guitar preparations, customized and abused effects through to more 'conventional' picking. These tracks were then sent to Zuydervelt for the addition of extra sounds and overdubs through to final editing and sequencing.\nWith both artists’ sharing a passion for developing upon the minutiae of the guitar, ‘Glisten’ is an immersive album of slowly unfurling sound layers, deeply embedded drones and acute harmonic gestures. Throughout the running time, a palpable sense of playfulness is present, allowing the prepared guitar process to determine the course of action. Through minor touches and sleights of hand, fleeting vibrations are produced which are capable of both overwhelming intensity and pure sonic transcendence.",

            "about": "Previously released on a limited edition 3-inch CDR\n'Soundlines' Comes in three parts.The first track 'Soundlines I' is the score to 'The Sounding Lines Are Obsolete' a film by John Price. It begins with washes of radio static sounds that come across sounding like digital ocean waves crashing against the rocks. Gareth Davis provides deep bass tones with Bass Clarinet and Contabass Clarinet. His sounds create a very mysterious feel and as the track progresses the vibe becomes more sinister with abstract frequencies and drones that together build a piece that is very cinematic. Simon Scott (Televise) provides additional sounds. 'Soundlines II' is the shortest track and is essentially a moody ambient piece and although this was not used as a soundtrack it follows on nicely from the first part, giving a cohesive flow and setting the scene for part III. Which begins by sounding like my decks when the earth cable comes out of the mixer. Davis' bass frequencies resonate under lovely machine sounds and creepy electronics. If you're a fan of either artist then I'd say this was pretty essential.\n(Norman Records)",

            "about": "About the Kaleiding performance:\nKaleiding is the debut show of the contemporary circus company Lily&Janick. It's a play between light, reflections and new perspectives onto partner acrobatics. With a long mirror that lays on the floor, images are getting created that hypnotize – like watching an everyday life situation through a kaleidoscope. This distorted reality invites into a decelerated world where up is down and down is up. Kaleiding is a movement based show working on the border between dance, circus and visual arts.\nMore info here:  www.lilyandjanick.com/kaleiding\n____\n'Never Return', an outtake of the Kaleiding score, appears on the Objects & Sound compilation Seasonal Diary III - Curious Enchantment:\nobjectsandsounds.bandcamp.com/album/seasonal-diary-iii-curious-enchantment\n____",

            "about": "Tape and cownload available at:\ncronica.bandcamp.com\n________\nL’incertitude, is Bruno Duplant and Rutger Zuydervelt’s first album as a duo. It came together very naturally, as if they played together for years already. There were no long discussions or conceptual heavy-handedness, these two tracks of pure sound exploration in the most intuitive sense, just flowed from the remote collaboration and the back-and-forth swapping of materials and compositions. The core of the collaboration rested upon trusting each other’s capabilities and on the mutual appreciation for each others' work. These two collage-like trips are loaded with suggestions of (otherworldly) spaces and places, but it’s the listener’s imagination that has to fill in the blanks.",

            "about": "Note: track 22 – 32 were previously released as the seperate 'Sol Sketches Supplement' album, but are now added to the Sol Sketches album, for completeness.\n___\nSketches of a score for a documentary by Chris Teerink\nabout Sol LeWitt.\nFilm director Chris Teerink asked me to make the soundtrack for a documentary he would be making about American artist Sol LeWitt. This was in 2009. Chris and I agreed that the music and the images should both be equally important in his film. We didn't want the score to overpower the images, but neither did we want it to become solely background 'muzak'. I searched for a certain openness in the sound, while at the same time keeping a directness to it. Musical references for me were the piano pieces of Morton Feldman (a friend of LeWitt), alva noto's collaborations with Ryuichi Sakamoto, and Enrico Wuttke's music project Flim.\nI must admit that I was relatively new to LeWitt's work. Searching for more information and images, my admiration for his art grew and grew. I found it extremely inspiring, and I became so (over) enthusiastic that within a week or two, I'd recorded more than one and a half hours of music before any footage had been shot.\nThese Sol Sketches can be seen as meditations on LeWitt's work. With some books of his work opened in front of me, I started improvising on the piano. This resulted in a few hours of raw material, which were then chopped up and edited into shorter pieces. I made about 40 of 'em, from which I've selected 21 for this release.\n____",

            "about": "This beautiful collaboration features two of the most prolific talents from the current experimental scene, both with reputations of leviathan proportions. For this release, Machinefabriek, based in Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and Peter Broderick, based in Berlin, Germany (although constantly on the road) set out to push each others limits, and to explore new areas within their own creativity.\nThe resulting album is a delicately crafted one, with Machinefabriek and Broderick virtuosically combining instrumental compositions, drone, and heartfelt soundscapes with song structures and vocals. Or as Peter Broderick himself put it: \"We tried a lot of different things on this album, pushing ourselves to explore new areas... And for me the result is the collection of music I feel most proud of so far.\"",

            "about": "After making several films without music, director Jessica Gorter went for a different approach for her recent film ‘The Red Soul’. Rutger Zuydervelt (aka Machinefabriek) was brought in to make the soundtrack for the documentary. They quickly agreed that the score needed to be very subtle, and not cliché-driven or overdramatic. An old bakelite record with a speech from Stalin and a few old LPs with Soviet songs became the starting point for the music. Fragments of these were sampled, transformed and combined with the saxophone of Ilia Belorukov and percussion by René Aquarius (of Dead Neanderthals). The result is a series of textural and tonal collages that evokes a sense of decay as well as (false) nostalgia, perfectly fitting the theme of the film. On the soundtrack album, the various parts of the score are assembled to be heard as one seamless piece - as a story in itself.\nThe Red Soul was selected for the prestigious IDFA (International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam) International and Dutch Competitions.",

            "about": "The score for a dance performance by choreographer Alexander Whitley and visual artists Marshmallow Laser Feast.\nAbout the performance:\nVisually striking and kinetically charged, The Measures Taken explores our interdependent relationship with technology. With the choreographic process rooted in the digital collaboration, the work is both a dialogue and a duet between human movement and the digital world.\nAt its core are questions of the role of technology in society and the contrasting ways we come to view the world in a culture highly mediated by digital technology. In the process, the piece explores the potential of technology to augment our self-image and change our understanding of what it means to be human.\nThe Meassures Taken was commissioned by the Royal Opera House and created in collaboration with visual artists Marshmallow Laser Feast, lighting designer Lee Curran, composer Rutger Zuydervelt and costume designer Oliver Townsend. The piece will premiered at the EXIT Festival at the Maison des Arts de Créteil, France on 1 & 2 April 2014 and had its London premiere at the Royal Opera House on the 15th & 16th May.",

            "about": "Lichtung is a collaborative project centered around an audio-visual installation. Sound artists Steve Roden and Rutger Zuydervelt (a.k.a. Machinefabriek) composed the audio, while the video element was provided by the German visual artist Sabine Bürger.\nThe installations exhibition was part of a series organized by Galerie Vayhinger revolving around the German concept of ‘heimat’ - the area in which someone was born or had their early formative experiences. Considering the artists’ far-flung locations it was decided that the gallery’s locale should provide them with a ‘temporary heimat’.\nThe Mindelsee lake situated just a few hundred yards away from the gallery became the natural focus of the installation. During their stay, Sabine and Rutger recorded the video and audio footage that became the foundation which Steve Roden responded to with material inspired by his surroundings in the US. It resulted in an immersive four-channel audio-visual presentation, in a gallery space also showing additional visual works by each of the artists, and the floor covered with dried leaves.\nThe CD edition of Lichtung is comprised of edits from the original Lichtung installation music, translating the audio-visual material of the original into a pure sonic experience. It’s complemented by an edit of a live performance that Rutger gave at the opening of the exhibition, using pre-recorded sounds provided by Steve Roden as well as leaves, twigs and water gathered in the area.",

            "about": "The Curve installation is a two-part inflatable tube, with a diameter of 2.5 meters, positioned as two interlocking spirals. One enters the Curve, walks through it, uninterrupted, with the rhythm of the music indicating the pace. At the end of the first tube, in the middle of the installation, there’s an open space. Still slowly walking, the visitor enters the second tube, which spirals outwards and leads towards the exit. The whole experience takes about 20 minutes, and is as beautiful as it is dissorienting.\nIn the installation, the music (played in a seamless loop) is spread through eight channels, each going to four speakers, so the sound is very spacious. For this standalone version of the score, I tried to make a stereo adaptation that mimics that spatial quality as closely as possible. It might not be the complete 'Curve experience', but it might transport you to interesting places nonetheless.\nCurve was first presented at Het Lage Noorden (Friesland, NL), from 22 June until 24 August 2024, then moved to Into the Great Wide Open festival (29 August 29 – 1 September, Vlieland, NL).",

            "about": "Machinefabriek is the alias for Rutger Zuydervelt currently residing in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Since 2004 Zuydervelt has unleashed an uncountable number of self-released 3\"CD's (his format of choice) in lovingly designed sleeves (all made by himself). In the past years some of these releases have been compiled into amazing albums such as \"Slaapzucht\" on the Root Strata label, \"Weleer\" on Lampse, the \"Cello Recycling\" 10\"/CD on Type Records and \"Bijeen\" on Kning Disk. Recent collaborations with Stephen Vietiello (on the 12K label), Freiband, Steinbrüchel and other likeminded artists have expanded the horizon veritably. Machinefabriek's music has been remixed by the likes of Xela, Lesser, Svarte Greiner, Alva Noto, Pita, Kim Cascone, Ben Frost, Black To Comm and others.\nOnly few Machinefabriek material has been recorded specifically for an album release but these have always been stand-outs in the vast catalogue. Both \"Marijn\" on Lampse and \"Ranonkel\" on Burning World Records were classic recordings, squeezing a large amount of what people love about Zuydervelt's music into one album, at the same time giving him the space to expand on new ideas. Likewise \"Dauw\" is one of Zuydervelt's most subtle & quiet yet refined works. Mainly built around small but gorgeous melodies of piano and guitar playing and the crackling sound of dusty vinyl samples, these songs slowly build into intensive hymn-like angel choirs of sheer heavenly beauty.\nZuydervelt's output often has drawn comparisons to the likes of Fennesz, Godspeed, Arvo Pärt, Basinski, Tim Hecker, Phillip Jeck, Mogwai and Earth, which is certainly not all wrong and some of these have been influences in the early stages of his career but he has since developed a strong and individual language all of his own.",

            "about": "After the file-sharing collaboration 'Doze Ruínas', double bass player Gonçalo Almeida and knob twidler Rutger Zuydervelt (alias Machinefabriek) continued their affair in real life. Their first concert was a hopeful start, but the second, February 25th 2016 at Koffie & Ambacht in Rotterdam, was a real 'hit'. The intimate setting and relaxed atmosphere seemed to work wonders for the duo. The improvised 30 minute set flowed organically, with Gonçalo looping his own playing, and Rutger adding electronic touches and further processing the sound of the double bass. The recording of the gig was edited to 20 minutes, and is presented now as 'Jangada', released on a 3-inch cdr and as a download by Cylinder Recordings.",

            "about": "CD available at Flag Day Recordings (US) and at SoundOhm (EU):\nflagdayrecordings.bandcamp.com/album/associated-sine-tone-services\nwww.soundohm.com/product/associated-sine-tone-serv\n___\nAssociated Sine Tone Services (ASTS) is a new conceptual collaboration between analog oscillator wielders Jeremy Young (Montreal, CAN), Nicolas Bernier (Montreal, CAN) and Rutger Zuydervelt (Schiedam, NL). This record was entirely generated using sine wave oscillators and an array of electronic filters, stacks, and processing.\nAlthough this project initially started with a bouquet of material put forth by Young to start, each track would eventually coalesce around the vision and momentum of one of the members individually, creating pocket productions that make the album in full, a diverse compendium of creative approaches to analog sound design.\nEschewing the codes and lexicons of “library music” here—despite the tongue-in-cheek reference to a canonical analog tape audio box in the artwork and graphic design, and the cheeky name of the project itself—the trio opted rather for a pop-melodic approach, which elevates each artist’s creative voice and personality. This is music, over sound design, contrary to what listeners might expect from an album entirely built from sine waves and the analog fidelity of vintage studio tools.\nLike navigating a strange dreamstate, the score feels moody and cinematic at times, flowing melodically and rhythmically in moments accompanied by velvety textures and dense timbres with tertiary twinkles and artifacts occasionally vying for the listener’s attention. Hilariously, this entire endeavor was actually drafted in a dream by Young in 2023, in which this exact trio was on stage in a dark underground club, all dressed in lab coats, adorned with their signal generators creating music together. The following morning, Young got to work on an initial bank of oscillator loops and sent both the audio and the proposal to Bernier and Zuydervelt.\nThe dream came true.",

            "about": "On 5 April 2022 I e-mailed Anne about working on a follow-up to our album Oehoe (released by Where to Now? Records in 2020). On April 7 she recorded a bunch of violin, viola and vocal improvisations at home. Gorgeous sounds and melodies, a gold mine to work with. The material basically wrote itself. I started editing and adding electronics (mainly virtual instruments, I don’t own a real harp), and by the end of that month, the album was finished.\nI always found the music that Anne and I make a bit pastoral, or eerie. Thinking about a title, will-o'-the-wisp came to mind, a ghost light in folklore. It fits the elusive quality of the music, I believe. As shorter is always better, we went for Wisps.\nThe cover art is a collage by Wytske van Veen. She posted the work on her Facebook page when I was busy with the album, and I immediately made the connection with the music. I love it when things fall into place like this.\nSo here it is, 28 minutes of (in Mariska Baars’ words) ‘pwetty weeeird’ music. Hope you’ll enjoy listening to it as much as we enjoyed making it.\nRutger Zuydervelt, May 2022",

Taking a series of her improvisations as the starting point, I started to edit and construct them into new songs - no preconceived plan, just being lead by these violin recordings.

            "about": "LP also available at Where To Now? Records (UK):\nwheretonow.bandcamp.com/album/oehoe\n______\nRutger Zuydervelt aka Machinefabriek needs no introduction - a hugely prolific Electronic Experimenter who has recorded for labels such as Type, Digitalis, Dekorder, Western Vinyl, and many many more, Where To Now Records are truly humbled to handle his latest collaborative work ‘Oehoe’. Produced in collaboration with viola/violinist Anne Bakker, a classically trained solo artist in her own right, and currently performing strings as part of Agnes Obel’s band, Machinefabriek here has sown a landscape of Anna’s raw violin, viola, and vocal improvisations into a stirring body of work which merges tradition, experimentation, and whimsical curiosity to create a distinctively unique album which is both deeply moving and playfully dissonant in equal measure.\nGiven that Anne’s improvised vocals are wordless throughout, it is to Rutger’s absolute credit that he has assembled and transcended these intonations to often devastating emotional effect. Anna’s vocal experiments exude classical polyphonic antiquity, they lushly hover above her own Reichian minimalist string arrangements, and Machinefabriek’s deeply brooding, cacophonic synthesized soundscapes. Across these 10 pieces we delve into a world which seamlessly moves between a state of harmonious contentment; or a very murky calm, to moments of lively ecstasy, and deep deep down to a vast and brooding melancholy.",

            "about": "An audio work based on the moment when an orchestra gets in tune, before a performance. Like this. An event that I wish could last forever, which is exactly what 'Stay Tuned' is about.\nMore then 150 musicians and singers were asked to record an 'A' (which is the note an orchestra normally tunes to), using whatever technique or style they please. So each 'A' has its own unique characteristics, but is also a small part of a much bigger drone.\n'Stay Tuned' is presented as a multiple-speaker installation, as a live performance piece and as the stereo adaptation/composition that can be found on this cd.\nMore info about Stay Tuned:\nmachinefabriek.nu/index.php/art_projects/stay_tuned",

            "about": "CD version available at  herbalinternational.blogspot.nl/2013/05/1301-machinefabriek-stroomtoon-ii.html\nIn December 2011 I recorded the album Stroomtoon, which was released by the French Nuun label the year after. The music was constructed using recordings from improvisations with a setup that I was trying out for upcoming live performances. It's the same setup that I still use nowadays, mainly consisting of an old Phillips analogue tone generator and a selection of effects units.\nWhen making Stroomtoon, it felt like moving into new territory that was worth explore more. While that album is very layered, subtle and considered, I wanted to try to capture the roughness and spontaneity of my live performances. I recorded more material, picked out the best moments, and edited them without adding too much post-production.\nWhen the labels Fake Jazz and Superior Standards asked me to release material on a few lathe cut singles, I knew this would be perfect for the music I was working on. simple, to the point vignettes with the ideal playing time for the 7-inch format.\nAfter making six Stroomtoon tracks and having them released on three extremely limited lathe cuts, I realized what a shame it was that they were so limited and that they weren't gathered on one medium, like the first Stroomtoon album.\nWith the extra value of having them in better sound quality then the lathes, I decided to compile them on this album, adding two other tracks that were previously released on lathe as well, my personal favorites Kreupelhout and Toendra. Stroop appeared on the compilation Antibothis 4. These extra tracks fit nicely with the other material on this album.\nThen there's the art of Rebecca Norton that's gracing this cd sleeve. Rebecca got in contact when I was working on the music. Browsing her website, I was immediatly grabbed by her 'The Affine(s): Small Paintings' series. Their spikey, concentrated shapes struck me as perfect visualizations of the Stroomtoon II II material. That's when all fell into place.\nRutger Zuydervelt, Rotterdam, January 2013",

            "about": "CD available here:\nshhpuma.bandcamp.com/album/barbatrama\n____\nThe Portuguese word Selva means “Jungle”, and this collaborative opus with Rutger Zuydervelt aka Machinefabriek is one more incursion towards Paradox. The Selva made this paradoxal enterprise its trademark: a trio with two string players (cello, bass) and a drummer with free improvisation and creative jazz as the matrix of their playing, but combining it with other musical languages, going from a deterritorialized kind of imaginary folk or world music to the picking of Renaissance and contemporary chamber music motives and formats. In “Barbatrama”, the band extends this kind of approach to experimental electroacoustics. The post-production electronic processings of Machinefabriek enabled Ricardo Jacinto, Gonçalo Almeida and Nuno Morão to go to unpredictable consequences: a puzzling sort of cybernetic tribal music, primeval dance rhythms associating with the space imaginaries introduced by Sun Ra but also Tangerine Dream. All musical appropriations introduced between these two parameters acts as flashes through human music history, and you can hear, here reflected, a plurality of sound visions, temporal and geographic: for instance, echoes of the string quartets from Mozart to Kurtág combine with pulsative structures that could come either from progressive rock or post-rock. All this with a disconcerting naturality, resulting in a fascinating trans-idiomatic music which dissolves in each one of the quoted idioms. In such a way that every attempt to label this album is an impossibility. A welcomed impossibility, that is.",

            "about": "Michel Banabila and Rutger Zuydervelt (aka Machinefabriek) have been collaborating since 2012. Although they both reside in Rotterdam, they (besides coming together for coffee) prefer to use the old file-swap-way of working. With each album, sounds and song drafts are frantically sent back and forth, in a short but super intense timespan of a week or two. This spontaneity is clearly audible throughout their music, with each album having its own distinct character.\nAfter the tight, post fourth world of 'Macrocosms', their fifth album 'Entropia' veers into much rougher terrain, adding distorted field recordings, bursting noise, nasty jump cuts and an overal sense of chaotic abstraction to the mix. 'Entropia' is definitely one of their more challenging efforts, an adventurous yet coherent sonic journey.",

            "about": "Weerkaatsing is the first collaboration by Rutger Zuydervelt (Machinefabriek) and Sietse van Erve (Orphax), both active players in the Dutch experimental electronic music field. While their paths did cross many times at concerts either as visitors or as performing artists, never before these prolific musicians got together. And as with so many collaborations also this one has a story behind it:\nReflectie (Orphax)\nThe idea behind this collaboration started in 2007, when Rutger released his EP Stofstuk and following this the remix album Kruimeldief. For years since the release I was intrigued by this little piece and the various remixes, and always had the idea of making a remix myself (and actually to start a series of unrequested remixes). Finally in 2016 I took the time to really work on this Stofstuk remix. With some magic and other forms of witchcraft I created the almost 20 minute long drone piece Reflectie, based solely on the Stofstuk piece. I tried to put a real Orphax touch to the work, but without losing the true Machinefabriek sound. As such it really felt for me as if we did a collaboration; and it was screaming for more. So I told Rutger about this and after I sent him the piece the idea came he would also remix one of my works. And from there this collaboration really kicked off...\nSpiegeling (Machinefabriek)\nThe first time I met Sietse was at a gig in Utrecht, probably in 2006 or so, but I’m not sure. Since then, I saw him at so many gigs… one of the regulars of the scene, I’d say. Anyway, in 2007 I invited a load of artists to make a remix of my track ‘Stofstuk’. The results appeared on the album ‘Kruimeldief’, but what was missing was Sietse’s remix. At least, that’s what I found out recently. Apparently he had been ‘secretly’ working on a beautiful 20-minute remake of my track. Damn, it was too nice not to do anything with it, so we decided that I should return the favour and do a remix of an Orphax piece. I choose 'Geluiden van de Eerste Dag’, of his 'Tragedie van een Liedjesschrijver’ album, the piece that resonated the most with me. And the rework was done in no time. Not because I was in a hurry, but because the basic material of the track was so grateful to work with. I added a few looped snippets of violin which I recorded at a rehearsal (for another piece), and these worked perfectly with Sietse’s sounds. ‘One plus one equals three’, I’d say (cliché or not).\nWeerkaatsing (Together)\nSo then we had two remixes. We had already decided to release this somehow, but it didn’t feel complete yet. That’s when ‘Weerkaatsing’, the title track, came to life. The most ‘collaborative collaboration’, and our favourite track of the album. It’s like the table tennis illustration on the cover; we kept bouncing sounds back and forth, until the track was finished. Which, again, didn’t take long. We were clearly on the same wavelength, and together with the other two tracks, I think it’s a really solid drone album.",

            "about": "'Macrocosms' is the fourth collaboration album by Banabila & Machinefabriek. Again, Michel Banabila and Rutger Zuydervelt spent a few concentrated weeks swapping sound files and sculpting ideas to fully form tracks. This intuitive way of working and open-minded approach resulted in an album that harks back to the rhythmic playfulness of 'Travelog', while also maintaining the abstract tendencies of 'Error Log'.\nThe overall theme deals with the macro and micro - how incredibly tiny and insiginificant we become when zooming out, and how wondrous small worlds can be found within ours when zooming in. Artist Sarah Payton describes it beautifully in her spoken word section of the title track.\nField recordings made by Banabila at the nature reserve Biała Woda in Poland are an important addition to the music, reinforcing the sense of place, and invoking intricate, detailed worlds of their own. Combining elements of ambient, musique concrète, noise, and even the 'fourth world', this Rotterdam duo created a unique sonic world expanding their oeuvre with another fine album.",

            "about": "I had sent Neil an electronic backing track to improvise on, with the idea to keep my part intact as the 'spine' of this long-form piece. But once I received his recording, things turned out differently. While playing around with his saxophone improvisation, I noticed it was full of fantastic details, full of life. I wanted to emphasize this and began to create loops from different fragments of the saxophone recording. Once I started to combine these loops, piling up layers, it seemed to create an entire world - an eerie but beautiful world.",

            "about": "The soundtrack for Memo Akten's virtual reality artwork FIGHT, which prèmiered at the STRP Biënnale, and was also shown at Sónar. Wearing an Oculus Rift headset, the viewer experiences an exceedingly psychedelic, 3D trip. The video shows different patterns and colours to each eye, causing 'binocular rivalry', an effect in which the brain makes its own fluctuating mix of the images.\nIn the virtual reality version, the music was spatialized, reactive to the movements of the viewer. This soundtrack EP presents the music as a mixed stereo version.\nThe second track on this EP is the soundscape that played in the room in which the installation was exhibited.\nMore about the FIGHT artwork:  www.memo.tv/fight/",

            "about": "Scores for the video installations Ecumenopolis and Capital City, part of Elian Somers' project A Stone From the Moon. In the installations, still images cross-fade slowly, with a voice-over and accompanying scores by Rutger Zuydervelt. This albums presents these soundtracks unadorned.\n___\nEcumenopolis\nFor this film, Elian Somers delved into a specific aspect of the Cold War: the efforts on both sides, East and West, to extend their spheres of influence by means of art and culture. As a counterpart to Socialist Realism, the US advanced modernist art as a vehicle for spreading Western values. This Cultural Cold War also took place on the front of architecture and urban development.\nAgainst this geopolitical background, Somers zooms in on Greek architect-planner Constantinos Doxiadis and his role as a cultural agent of change. In the 1950s and 60s, Doxiadis developed many key projects across the Middle East, Asia and Africa, and was responsible for the modernist master plans of Riyadh, Baghdad and the brand new capital Islamabad. Parallel to these projects, he worked on his own mission: a visionary urbanist theory which he named ekistics, the science of human settlements. Its ultimate aim was a blueprint for a future city that would encompass the entire world: Ecumenopolis.\nIn Somers’ film a voice-over tells us about Doxiadis’ mission and his interdisciplinary network of inspirational fellows, which he gathered annually on a boat in the Aegean Sea to contribute to his mission. Her camera hovers around the island Delos and the ancient city where Doxiadis would take them. In order to envision the urban future, they were to travel back in time. As the story unfolds, Somers interweaves two rather different perspectives on Doxiadis and his ‘Delians’, drawing both on official archives celebrating his architecture as a practice beyond politics, and on alternative sources that trace a more complex context.\n___\nCapital City\nWith Capital City Elian Somers investigates the evolution of Eurasia as a geographical, political and cultural concept. Speaking from the near future, a voice-over traces visions of Eurasia, conceived both as a past to hark back to and a future destination. Somers’ research for this work centered on Nursultan Nazarbayev, president of post-communist Kazakhstan between 1991-2019, who cast himself as a Eurasianist visionary and architect. The new capital city he erected from scratch in the Kazakh steppe was not just a nationalist project, but was also envisioned as the Heart of Eurasia, making this idea manifest as a concrete reality as well as a utopian project with much wider ramifications.\nCapital City Somers evokes an image of the futurist city Nazarbajev had in mind, by means of photographs she took of iconic architecture on location. The voice-over narrative connects Nazarbajev’s Eurasian mission with earlier ideas explored by the Eurasianist movement just after the Russian Revolution as well as the Eurasian ideologies that are deeply entwined with the Kremlin today. Her cyclical narrative underscores how, over the past hundred years, the idea of Eurasia continues to be resurrected, while the underlying visions and geopolitical implications also reveal significant shifts.\n___\neliansomers.nl/a-stone-from-the-moon.html",

            "about": "With Voices is the newest recording by Dutch composer Rutger Zuydervelt under the moniker Machinefabriek. True to its title, the album’s eight pieces exhibit Zuydervelt’s use of cassette recorders, tone generators, radios, synths, and other hifi curio to construct bewildering aural architecture around vocal work from Peter Broderick, Marissa Nadler, Richard Youngs, Chantal Acda, Terence Hannum (of Locrian) and others. These human voices are featured as musical instruments rather than mere vehicles of lyrical content, resulting in a sub-linguistic mosaic of primordially stirring moods.\nThe initial spark of With Voices was kindled while Zuydervelt was in Taipei creating music for a dance company. In the final days of his trip, a dancer named Wei-Yun Chen caught Zuydervelt’s ear with an instagram video featuring a voice that turned out to be Wei-Yun’s own (she would end up on the album’s seventh movement, a piece that features dissected bits of Taiwanese poetry amid low-pitched murmurs and whispering fogbanks of static). The encounter stirred Zuydervelt to create a single 35 minute soundscape upon which each vocalist on With Voices was encouraged to improvise, be it talking, reading, singing, or wordless, guttural intoning. Such vocal smatterings were then used to determine how the other tonal elements should be arranged, dictating where each musical passage would ultimately lead. “The idea was for everyone to just do what came naturally” he recalls, “the element of unpredictability was important to me.”\nIndicative of this approach “III” (the tracks are simply titled with Roman numerals) slowly winds like ivy through staccato phrases spoken by Zuydervelt’s peer Peter Broderick, whose micro-incantations skip along mechanically only to telescope into monastic grandeur at the track’s midpoint; the vibrations of vocal cords are often stretched to a seismic hum to form the heavy implements in Zuydervelt’s toolkit. On “V”, tape recordings of Zero Years Kid (aka Joachim Badenhorst) sputter with their own apparent intelligence like a faulty AI attempting to interpret reels of human speech in some ruinous library of the distant future. Finally, a siren-like Marissa Nadler leads the suite to its lullabic endpoint with overlapping wisps of harmony devoid of accompaniment ending the album on an angelic note.\nIn these moments, like much of With Voices, warm-blooded arteries seem to have grown around bits of well-designed artifice to form something warmly alien, soberly futuristic, and inherently satisfying. More than simply an album of collaborative features, With Voices is a mutating collage of modern minimalism that challenges as often as it comforts. There is an alchemical, metallurgical quality that arises from Zuydervelt’s unique way of merging humanness with abstraction, harshness with beauty, and unintelligibility with familiarity on what may be the most affecting Machinefabriek release to date.",
