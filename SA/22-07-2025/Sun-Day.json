            "about": "This is the first hour of a twenty-four hour work called Sun-Day. Writing and recording for Sun-Day began in 2004, and the project itself was conceptualized years prior to that. Originally intended to remain completely ambient, over years of work the idea was revised and expanded to include more experimental territories such as heavy drones and textural works, as well as field recordings and instrument-focused works for guitar and organ.\nSince a project of this scope and size cannot accurately be explained in a single summary, it is appropriate that Sun-Day will be issued one hour at a time, once a month for the next two years. This release schedule will culminate in a collectible box of some kind, designed to house all twenty-four components, and possibly include some additional extras.\nFor now, here is Sun-Day 1, beginning with the drone-speech of First Light, giving way to a weather forecast and closing with an elegant guitar improvisation of ambient blues. If memory serves, these recordings were completed at 114RKD in 2007 or 2008, and hopefully provide an interesting and apt opening for the series.",

            "about": "After a full day's climb to the peak of the mountain, you finally emerge through the cloud cover as if you are entering heaven itself. Careful in your step, you ascend even higher than the offwhite tufts, where you locate an ample ledge to sit down on. You roll your backpack off your shoulders, and think momentarily about your weary, aching feet and hands. The pain quickly sinks below your awareness as your eyes look forward. It seems like you can see for hundreds of miles from here, and the sun is slowly sinking below majestic lines of purple and orange. A lone ember fallen from some cosmic torch, diving into the sea that is actually the sky. You observe a rare stillness, where even your own breath feels like a trespass in this sacred place. You hear the wind blowing sigh after sigh through the treetop canopy below your feet. The horizon feels endless in all directions, shrinking your entire existence down as the purples melt into blue, then gray. You think about the world below, and how little it matters here. This is your home now - the clouds your bed, the sky your blanket. The stars begin to come out, one tiny diamond at a time. Each one of those is yours, too.",

            "about": "At the top of a mountain summit, covered in fog, sits a solitary shack, leaning sleepily against a rock wall spattered with patches of green moss and tangling vines. Stumbling in from what was surely a long climb, a lone figure pierces the rolling gray and enters the lean-to. The figure removes a hat, sets it down in the dark, and after some fumbling, lights a small oil lamp, revealing himself to be a tired looking man, bearded, with greasy black hair, perhaps in his early thirties. He absentmindedly tosses a sack from his shoulder to a dusty table, and pulls up a matching dusty stool to sit down. He reaches into his bag, knowing hands removing two items and carefully placing them on the wooden tabletop below his face: A green glass bottle, shaped almost like a wine bottle, but slightly smaller, with no label, and a dark purple liquid sloshing around within, then - after a slight pause - a book. Bound in crackling and peeling brown leather, with golden designs down the spine and in a more central formation on the cover. No text whatsoever, only the darker brown traces of being carried for a very long time in the form of oily residues and slight indentations. Rain begins to fall, tapping on the tin roof in a steady dribble of noise. He opens the tome to reveal a bright white light beaming up onto his grizzly features, so bright that it is impossible to tell if the book even has pages. As we inch closer to look over the man's shoulder, we too stare down into the brightness to see a vision of a landscape, devoid of any figures or trees. A barren horizon of perhaps desert or grassland, impossible to be sure about given the twilight-colored lighting provided, surrounding a solitary stone. Not a particularly remarkable formation, to be sure, but what the stone lacks in character it more than makes up for in size. Like a giant pyramid that has been eroded for thousands of years until only an egg-like shape remains. One monolithic grey oval, a silent stone God to cast dominion over this empty plain. Or is it a plane? Could we be seeing something from another Earth? Or some alien world? Somehow, it feels heavy, significant, imposing and important. It commands the attention of our mind and the man's mind. Suddenly, after what seems like forever in waiting, another burst of light pours forth from the massive stone. It simply blasts pure white fluorescence for a moment, like an eye that has not been opened (or awakened?) for eons. Then, after its own consideration has been sated, we're shown what we are apparently meant to see: another figure, this one a man who looks remarkably like our mountain visitor, only perhaps living a few centuries later. He is sitting at a table, inside what looks to be a carpenter's work space, and he is asleep with his head slumped into his crossed arms. The same green glass bottle sits empty beside his head, with a blue candle that has recently expired next to it. As if he suddenly becomes aware that we are seeing him, the sleeping man wakes up, and our vision through the stone closes abruptly, leaving us again with that solitary rock. Satisfied, the man on the mountain closes his strange book as well, and somewhere, perhaps in another world or time (or both) another man is trying to remember a dream.",

            "about": "Night falls over a windy landscape. Dirt whirls up in the shape of a formidable air current, obscuring the path ahead. For twelve long years, we've barely survived trying to cross what's left of the country. Night is always getting longer. Night is always the hardest. I used to take some small comfort in the stars, thinking to myself that they were all witness to every awful thing that's happened in the universe...that they knew me, and could relate to me. If only I knew now, what I knew then. Through this storm, there must be a clearing. A place where burgeoning night is shoved aside by the holiest of holies, a chorus of suns. A temple of all that is white, light and good. A dawn of dawns. And I will take us there, into that bright light, and we will feel its warmth, and eat apples and sing songs. We'll be happy. We'll be safe.",

            "about": "Recorded in a single improvised live session at Foxhill, out in the Carolinian countryside, Sun-Day 13 showcases the series most prominent use of guitars so far. Room acoustics via hardwood floors and a hint of an open window letting in rural cosmetics. Windchimes hung from the neck of an electric guitar. Sad organ and stately pedal bass. Vignettes of pure texture and color. The feeling of missing someone, and the feeling of orange summer heat.",
            "credits": "released June 13, 2014\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at Foxhill, Summer 2008. Mastered by The Analog Botanist. This is Milieu Music number SD13, and 13th in the 24-part Sun-Day series.",

            "about": "Five stark pieces of drone improvisation are the bones that form Sun-Day 14. Isolationist tangents that play out across guitar strings and organ keys, anchored by nothing, left to drift forever. These five pieces offer a more organic counterpoint to the monochromatic drones present on Sun-Day 7, with eroded corners and reverb-smeared melodic passages that melt down in slow blurs. Only in the fourth movement, Shroud, does a warm chordal loop emerge to help you find your way back. It should come as no surprise that the way back is longer than the way you came.",

            "about": "Two extended pieces of droning organ, guitar and pedal bass in a similar approach as Sun-Day 10, this time emphasizing thought projections that were constructed during a 90 minute isolation tank session. Instrumental free association takes the place of speech and explanation, and the less you think about anything the more it makes sense. These pieces run the length necessary to normalize your surroundings to the point that you can no longer tell where your body ends and the music begins, and only when you can view the landscape visible outside of your own body can you truly measure the shallow depth of our current day to day existence.",

            "about": "Sun-Day 16 is one of the few volumes of the series that went through a myriad of changes before settling into its final form. Shorter tracks were longer, longer tracks were shorter, the sequencing and titling alone went through about half a dozen iterations. Something was elusive about this album, despite my clear-headed intentions while making it. I set out to record music that felt connected to vivid fantasy realms I loved (in literature, gaming and art) with a focus on opalescent luxuriousness. Royal ambient for the drunken parties of kings from far off lands. In the end, I think the music itself was so ambient, so vague, that it defied categorization on my behalf. In the spirit of change, here is Sun-Day 16 - dimly lit catacombs, blood-stained wine cellars, stone towers and exotic incense.",

            "about": "Recorded in 2007 after the full 2CD release of Brother surfaced for the first time, Sun-Day 17 has aged and collected dust for almost eight years, now ripe and ready for daylight again. Composed in a similar approach as Brother, very deliberate and led by melody instead of improvisation, and written with a heavy dose of longing for the sea, as evidenced by the song titles. Additionally, I took a lot of inspiration from my friend Luke's ambient masterwork Warming Plant (released as Ourson), and wanted to convey the lonesome introspection one might experience while on a lengthy oceanic voyage, disconnected from land, people, civilization, losing sense of time and movement.The Sun-Day series in some ways functions as a set of analogues to other records I've done, and this one is most definitely the mirror-universe version of Brother. Somehow, in this album's five tracks, I feel I've bested Brother's twenty tracks, but it could just be me.",

            "about": "The eighteenth hour of Sun-Day brings with it a bounty of midrange sadness and lonesome guitars. Recorded sometime in 2008, next to an open window blowing in the breeze (and occasional windchime), SD18 inhabits the same family of sound as Eight Thousander, Blue Wheatfield and many other of my ambient guitar works. In these recordings, all live takes with no overdubs, you can feel the billowing wind that only comes on before a big storm, and you can smell the sweetness in the air.",
            "credits": "released December 16, 2014\nW/P by Brian Grainger. Recorded at 114RKD, 2008. Mastered by The Analog Botanist at Botany Bay, January 2015. This is Milieu Music number SD18, and 18th in the 24-part Sun-Day series.",

            "about": "Morning begins in a gentle, dew covered field, surrounded by trees but open to the sky. The sun rises from behind the treeline, stretching lines of yellow warmth across the soft grass and flowers. As light reaches every corner of the expanse, birds begin to sing, and the cloudless sky slowly melts away night's purple quietude in favor of a beautiful baby blue. By noon, a light patter of rain begins to fall, much to the delight of the hundreds of different colored flowers. As the falling drops reach their crescendo, they produce a soothing wall of white noise, and if you listen closely enough, you can hear far-off melodies being played within it, perhaps by the Great God Pan. Having had their fill of hydration, the flowers droop with moist satisfaction, and the rainfall recedes. The field is once again still, and empty.",

            "about": "The second hour of the Sun-Day set is actually the first recording session undertaken for the project, sometime in late 2004 or early 2005. In hindsight, it's pretty remarkable to hear now, knowing how different everything else I was writing and releasing back then sounded. It's hard for me to imagine this music inhabiting the same physical space, and being created with the same equipment, as something like Slow Lid Close. Yet, it exists, and all these years later I still think it works. Also, a small note - Sun-Day 1 was issued on my birthday, and Sun-Day 2 is now issued on my father's birthday.\nMusically, it slithers around in ghostly movements that aren't really that musical at all. Elemental sounds give way to actual tonalities, then fizzle out again in a wash of reverb and subterranean noise. I distinctly remember these sessions being vividly inspired by a large lagoon next to a plant my father worked at in the 1980's. Massive, organic, dark, hinting at movements below the surface, and yet also somehow industrial and whirring with unseen machine energies.",

            "about": "You open the bathysphere door, uncertainly. As you step inside, an array of multicolored lights turn on all around you, activated by your movement. The gentle but persistent whirr of machinery hums into life, and without a second thought to convince yourself otherwise, you shut the hatch behind you, which closes with a definitive metal snap, followed by the noise of pressurized air being released. The maps led you this far, didn't they?\nYou sit down in the comfortable red leather chair. You notice an odd absence of decorative flair anywhere inside the container - whoever built it was far more concerned with function than form. That feels reassuring. Your reassurance quickly fades, however, when you reach over your shoulder for the safety belt to find that it has been forcefully torn off, leaving only frayed shreds of black fabric at four corners of the chair. Placing your shaking hands on the lever mechanism before you, you push ever so slightly, finding that it isn't enough to budge the controls. Putting your weight into it, the machine lurches forward, and the sensation of falling occurs to you. The bathysphere has dropped and is now en route to whatever destination its creator intended.\nThe dash lights swiftly become brighter than ever as the bathysphere darkens and begins to crack with freezing pressure. Your sweat beads up and seems to crystallize almost immediately. You can't help wondering if you've just taken the first step of your last twenty. After several minutes of a descent that seemed like hours, your drop ends gently with a muted buoyant feeling. You wipe away the porthole as much as you can with your skeletal cold fingers, and at last you see it: A fleet of strange oblong vessels, covered in either blue or silver metals, with long black tube-like talons silently drilling a gigantic upside down mountain of ice above them. Connected to the sides of a few of these ships were dimly lit passages that, from your distance away, looked like veins floating out and downward. These must be connections to a seafloor base of some kind. Your next destination identified, you once again take the controls of the pod into your hands and, through some external mechanism unknown to you, the bathysphere clicks slowly forward, likely on a laid track.\nAs the ships become closer you can see just how large they are - the smallest of them could easily be longer than an aircraft carrier. Eventually they drift out of view completely as you descend into whatever nexus lies below the mining fleet. Another metal click, again followed by the hiss of air, and then a rumbling sound. You notice the water level around your pod lowering slowly. A moment later, the hatch pops open with a pried metallic cracking sound - perhaps the craft was not truly meant for multiple trips. You sit for a minute, staring intently at the open space beyond the door, waiting for something to happen. Your eyes adjust to the very dim light in the decompression chamber and finally, you step outside.\nThe chamber itself is totally unremarkable, save for one specific detail: a printed line of text on the wall by the only door that reads \"NOVA KOLUMBIA PROFUNDA MINERIA KONSILANTARO\" and below that in smaller letters \"Divido Tri / Glacia Reklamon\". Parts of the writing seem to make sense to you, in some way, but you've never seen language like it before. Your curiosity piqued, you open the door...",

            "about": "In 2010, three transmissions were received from a distant superstructure in deep space. The data was interpreted, reformatted and released on playable disks which were sent out in the hope that someone could identify their origin and meaning. No such response or explanation has yet been received, but some time after the production of these disks, a fourth unexpected transmission was recorded. As before, the data was transformed into readable audio files, and is now posted here as an addendum to the previous effort in 2010. Do you know what this is, or what it means? Perhaps the answer is too much to bear for our simple minds. In time, an explanation will present itself, no doubt. The only remaining question then would be \"Who will be listening?\"",

            "about": "An album of four fourths, brought to life in appreciation of symmetry, duality, palindromes and perfect halves. However perfect any kind of symmetry may be, our perception of space and objects in space will always be at the mercy of our asymmetrical eyes and minds. So, like an artist longing to break the impossibility of creating a perfect circle, so that he may explore new frontiers of depth and scale, I have created this vessel to symbolize my obsession with symmetry and also my acknowledgement of defeat in the face of it. There is calmness in resignation, but there is also inevitably regret, because we are asymmetrical, organic, imperfect and governed ultimately by our emotional inner selves. We live in a world filled with imperfection, and yet we live in societies obsessed with perfection. Somewhere between the two is my simple proposal: neither.",

            "about": "So here we are, Sun-Day 23, celebrating the eve of the end. What better way to preface the final act than with a return to roots? Nine ambient blues pieces, all near-improvisations on electric guitar, that echo the only instrument-sourced track on Sun-Day 1 (Retroazimuth). These nine passages of deep country sadness are similar in tone and playing style of records like Eight Thousander, Nine Billion Names, Blue Wheatfield and the oft-named but not yet released Summer's Parting Ways. Indeed, Sun-Day 23 was mostly recorded during the same timespan as Nine Billion Names, which may be more evident to longtime listeners. In the interest of context, I'll also disclose a small truth: Each of these tracks relate in some way to a member of my family, and were conceived as a kind of musical family tree to be placed carefully into the Sun-Day oeuvre. More than that, no one else would possibly know except myself, and that discrete feeling of something personal being written down and stashed away, a secret kept for the rest of your life, is very present to me within the bent lead melodies and downtuned chords of Sun-Day 23. Now, onward - to the end!\n\"Well, you and I collapsed in love. And it looks like we might've made it. Yes, it looks like we've made it to the end.\"\n-D. Albarn, 1994",

            "about": "Ten years of conception, recording work, planning, revising and renewing has brought me here. Sun-Day was always the penultimate project on my back burner, as the decade passed by and I refined my creativity with other projects - as such, Sun-Day only grew stronger, more potent and refined itself. Originally there were plans to make a lavish box set as far back as 2007, a designed art piece by David Tagg, filled with music that might have been very different than what has been released here. Eventually, as plans were abandoned and everything remained where it always was - on years and years of tapes, CD-Rs and hard drives - it finally dawned on me that the only feasible way to release something so large and so detailed was to do it one piece at a time. Once Bandcamp entered the picture, this idea became even more probable, and so here we are now, on the 24th hour of a 24-hour set of albums. Two years from where we began, with a catalog of rich and colorfully varied ambient music behind us. How to say goodbye, then?\nWith a single decisive piece of music. Three chords, played over sixty minutes, ascending into heaven from the lowest possible octave to the highest, all the while mutating slowly with layers of subtle effects and texture, and by the end...trailing off so beautifully into an unedited field recording of me playing in the backyard with my daughter Penelope. One last ambient trip, one last push on the swing.\nBut is it really goodbye? What now, with Sun-Day having ended? After all this time and effort, it seems selfish of me to have brought you all this far only to leave you here. And you know me better than that. You do know me by now. We've been close for at least two years.\nWhat follows will be an intermittent open-ended catalog of transmissions sent from the vast Fantasia of my subconsciousness - SOL AUBADE - a song for lovers in the early hours of the morning, and a song for the sun. These pieces will appear here, uploaded to bask in the shallow pools of gold left in the wake of Sun-Day. There is more to say, but it will not be said here, or now.\nThanks to everyone who followed me on this trip. I'm extremely grateful to have an audience for my strange creations. Also, someone recently pointed out the fact that Sun-Day's collective runtime is actually over the 24 hour mark. To that, all I can say is: Some days are longer than others.",

Rumbling mountainsides ache and swell, giving way to glacial drones that melt away to reveal simple melodies. Cavernous reverbs and deep sustained chords form misty walls. Endless sleep awaits in the ruins of ancient cathedrals, buried underground.",

            "about": "Hour four of Sun-Day continues on the path of primordial young-Earth drones. Melodies arch over empty skylines, eons pass like seasons. Where there was once dry ground and the bones of crashed stars before, water now dominates. This is the sound of life slowly blooming from amoebic forms, in the still depths of new oceans. The record ends with the half-hour \"Kola S.B.\", itself a mammoth exercise in the measurement of depth, and a solitary meditation on the passage of time.",

            "about": "The fifth hour of Sun-Day is a sepia-tinted dream of defocus and desolation. Wind blows over seashells and eroded rock formations, forming indistinct alien melodies, weaving between small islands peaking out of the blue water like scattered pieces of crumbled mountains. These pieces are the last tributes to long lost and sunken kingdoms, once grand and pristine, decorated in the finest gold and ivory, now reduced to sad missives of sand and coral-covered pillars sleeping beneath the waves.\nOn a technical note, this hour of the series was recorded sometime in 2006, directly following the sessions for Beyond The Stars/Beyond The Sea (Infraction Records, 2006). While not using the same tape loops those recordings did, these pieces were created using the same equipment configuration, and with the same aesthetics in mind. In that way, Sun-Day 5 could be considered the spiritual counterpart to the oceanic Infraction recordings.",

            "about": "Sun-Day 6 is a soundtrack for an imagined life at the bottom of the sea, from the vantage point of some kind of research facility filled with deep-pressure biomes and hydroelectric power systems. Perhaps something became unstable, or irradiated, and everyone living there had to leave. Then, slowly, the sea retakes it's inevitable and undeniable dominance, a few sections at a time. So Sun-Day 6 happens without any sun at all - only small fixtures of fluorescent light from deep within the blackness.\nThis installment of Sun-Day was one of the earliest recorded in 2004/2005, although in it's initial form, it consisted solely of the original hour-long \"Oval Meditations\", which was since edited down in favor of including other pieces from the session. I don't remember the exact setup for the recordings, but I do know a simple wave generator was used predominantly, giving this album a very alien and subterranean atmosphere.",

            "about": "A halftone fog of invisible radiation and fumes unfurls across a desolate, deserted landscape. A sinister curtain that hides a poisonous maw within its black folds, beckoning you to come closer in a hypnotic sway of wind. Breath deepens, lungs fill with noxious gases, and the mere enunciation of a simple monosyllabic word now takes eons to spill from your paralyzed lips. Like a slow motion horn echoing from a distant castle, all that you are falls helplessly and motionlessly through layer after layer of nothing. Light years away, and still drifting, you close your eyes and give up.",

            "about": "Three glacially paced epics of humming organ bass and majestic arcs of resonating chords, all named for and improvised in tribute to South Carolinian mountains and ranges that I visited in my youth. Underneath the igneous crust of these weathered mammoths, there is a very distilled and very traceable sadness. The feeling of trying to remember things that are already almost lost, knowing even what you can recall at this present moment will be more than every one of your tomorrows. Memory is like a sandy beach that slowly washes away after the rains and tides of age take back their elements. This recording is an attempt at saving something that I feel I might one day lose entirely. We'll have to see if the hopeful permanence of art can withstand the brutal, tangible permanence of time's movement forward.",

            "about": "A lone wanderer wakes up in an old mine, which is falling apart from years (perhaps decades) of disuse and empty of any other people. He remembers nothing about how he arrived there, or why, and begins to venture through it to leave. Upon finding the mine's entrance on the surface, the sun sets and he is given just enough time to see that he is in the middle of a giant desert expanse, with no discernible details elsewhere on the landscape before him. The cold quickly sets in, making the man aware of his attire: a worn out brown leather overcoat and rugged corduroy trousers. He retreats back into the mine, where he lights a fire and fashions a sleeping cot out of some burlap bags he found near some tools. Outside, an aggressive wind picks up, howling and rapping at the creaking wooden door on the mine's entrance. The wanderer puts up his coat's collar and lays down next to the fire, drifting off as he stares into it. The next day, he ventures out in the early morning hours, hoping to find his way back to civilization. Walking briskly at first, the sun soon takes its place above him and bears down on his neck and back, reducing the speed of his stride. Just as the evening begins to approach again, he sees a flag on the horizon line, fluttering lazily in the hot wind. He is hopeful, picking up his pace and taking measured breaths to maintain it. Upon arriving, he finds a waystation of some kind, with an old looking radio set that doesn't seem to produce anything but fuzz, and a leather-bound log book of some kind, filled with characters he cannot read or translate. The flag he observed earlier bore the same characters, and from the look of it, had been left to fly for a very long time. He builds another fire as nightfall arrives, then retreats into the outpost cabin to sleep. The next morning he is up again, and decides to take the strange log book with him. Within a couple hours, he finds a massive sunken area that could have once been a lake, now dried to the bone. Inside it are dozens and dozens of rusted ships' remains, some nearly whole and others just fragments of their former selves. Chunks of angular metal defiantly jut upward from under the sand, and the skeletal shapes remind the man about his own hunger. He cannot remember the last time he ate food, or even what it was. Slowly entering the dry lake, he sees a single mountain in the miles ahead of him. Although he has no reason to suspect it, something in his gut tells him he will find what he seeks there. Without hesitation, he begins his long walk toward the ominous peak...",
