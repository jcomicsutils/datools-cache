            "about": "Babylon Or Lawrence Kansas is 13 tracks mashed into one, in the interest of keeping form with what I'm ripping off.\ncontraktor.bandcamp.com/album/babylon-or-kansas-city-ii\nI had months to work on this, and so I used months to do just that. This is the most extensive, interesting, and thought-out Ragk project I've ever done. Honestly, it might just be the most thought-out project I've ever done, period.\nAll sounds [except for the movie clip sample in the intro] on the album were recorded on or around my grandparents' farm, where I've been for the past 6-or-so months. They were edited [pretty heavily] with a demo version of FL Studio I was able to fit onto their junker PC. The sounds were recorded with a ZTE burner smartphone my grandmom bought for me. The album art is a collage of collages I did while here. I went so far as to have any non-collage objects [the phone, mountain dew, and ham in the bottom left, the bandana, the two American flags] run through a scanner alongside the actual collages. Individual collages as well as various other art I did come with the download of this album, so you should download it!",

            "credits": "released July 1, 2022\nA visceral unpacking of the realities of being raised by an abusive, manipulative parent with narcissistic tendencies: what it's like to be used as a tool to shackle your other parent in an abusive marriage, what it's like to watch younger siblings be brought into this world well after you know the realities of what inevitably also be their upbringing, watching the facade crumble as you become an adult, and the inevitably learned behavior that unavoidably was permanently planted into your mind. By being abused and manipulated your whole life, you are, against your will, given the tools to and taught how to manipulate others for your own gain, how to hurt those you love. Above all else, it is necessary torture to rip this from your head.\nPicture your mother so focused on beating the fuck out of you that she's speeding down a busy city street, swerving between lanes, and about to run a red light. Picture feeling certain this is how and where you die before you've even finished middle school. Hurdling towards the intersection where 23rd St turns into Clinton Parkway in Lawrence, Kansas, I was ready to accept my fate.",

I drown the details in obscurity and distortion, but I feel increasingly both cowardly and disingenuous, and moreover I feel like I'm failing my own art by not discussing blatantly and bluntly about those subjects and events, and those thoughts, opinions, and experiences. when I started out with this, I sought to bring a unique viscerality to my power electronics by speaking about things that were happening directly and uniquely to me, about my direct life experience. in being so specific I backed myself into a corner. so we lay this bare today. I was born on April 24th, 2000 in Homewood, Alabama. my parents lived in Montevallo, mind you, but the hospital was in Homewood. when I was 2 years old, my dad was carrying me while trying not to slip on the ice covering the ground. he failed in this, falling hard on his back. I slammed the back of my skull on the concrete.",

The sound literally never ended.",

Not this time. The only time a computer was involved in this was uploading it [and recording the actual audio I guess]. I went out and actually got myself some fuckin' pedals! I'm a real noise guy now! This is a series of experiments made with two guitar pedals and a cassette player that also acts as a microphone at times. Also including some of my first forays into power electronics!",

            "about": "\"Let me see your wrist.\"\nWhy?\n\"You're hurting yourself, aren't you?\"\nWhy are we having this conversation?\n“I cannot believe you! After all this talking ME down from hurting MYself, here you are with cuts on your wrist!”\nThis isn’t any of your business.\n“Why was my self harm your business?”\nBecause you MADE it my business! YOU came to ME for help. I am not coming to you. I don’t want help.\n“Then why are the cuts on your wrists?”\n…\n“Why are the cuts on your wrists where everyone can see them, idiot?”\n...\n////////////////////////////////\nI don't understand why no one talks to me.\n\"Do you talk to anyone?\"\nI talk to people. People don't talk to me. People don't initiate conversations.\n\"How many people do you initiate conversations with?\"\nToo many. I'm done talking to people if they don't talk to me first.\n\"Don't you think that it's a little hypocritical to complain about no one starting conversations if you yourself don't go start conversations? Why is that onus on them?\"\nI don't know, it's just... I don't know.\n\"Maybe you're just cursed with being more sociable than most folks.\"\nCursed is right.\n////////////////////////////////\n“You have to eat!”\nI am eating!\n“How many calories are you having a day?”\nI don’t know! I don’t keep track of that stuff.\n“Bull. Shit. I know you better than that.”\nLike, 1000? Usually?\n“A THOUSAND?? YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE TWICE THAT, AT LEAST!!”\nIt’s going to be worth it.\n“Is this why you keep sitting down? Are you lightheaded? It’s unsafe, this is unsafe.”\nI’ll be fine. I know what I’m fucking doing.\n////////////////////////////////\n\"But you still gotta take care of yourself. It’s better to live it up for a longer amount of time than a shorter amount of time.\"\nTaking care of myself is something for 24-year-old me, who's really really surprised and confused that she's still alive.\n\"My sister knows a lot about that\"\nI look up to her a lot. I look up to your sister a whole lot.\n\"There came a point when I realized staying alive is just easier than dying.\"\nI'd have to, like, die. Being alive is my default state.\n\"Yeah.\"\n////////////////////////////////\n\"You're a woman who was fucked over and needs love and support from people who love you.\"\nYeah, but once I grow and change and heal and become a strong, beautiful, confident woman, then what? I will have no purpose.\n\"What the fuck are you talking about?\"\nI mean, think about it. What happens when I'm done growing?\n\"Um, well...\"\nWhen I'm done changing, done improving, what then?\n\"You don't. You're going to be growing for a long ass time.\"\nWell, then, if it doesn't end, what's the point?\n\"To stay alive and use your experiences to help others. If you've been through hell and survived it, why not stick around and give the younger women help? Why let that suffering go to waste?\"\n...\n\"I love you. You got this.\"\n////////////////////////////////\n“I’m sorry for blowing up on you about noticing your cuts on your wrist.”\nIt’s okay. I was being dumb.\n“Are you still hurting yourself?”\n...yes.\n“It’s okay. I am too.”\nI promise to never put you down for it again.\n“Likewise.”",
