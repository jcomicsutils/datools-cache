            "about": "Originally released as a vinyl LP on Aguirre Records.\nwww.aguirrerecords.com\n\"Pulse Emitter joins the Aguirre catalogue with a stunning new album full of clear cosmic tones for the new space age. Artwork by Caroline Teagle, Pressed on 180gr. vinyl, Limited edition of 400 copies\"\n\"Hypnotically beautiful new LP from the undisputed king of planetary scale synth hypnosis, Daryl Groetsch aka Pulse Emitter. As the title suggests this LP is based around a series of visionings of praterhuman timescale, ancient to future. ... No one touches Pulse Emitter in terms of personally-sourced visions of synthesised eternities and this is another major mover. Highly recommended.\" --David Keenan/Volcanic Tongue\n\"Portland's Daryl Groetsch has been therapizing modular synth tones as Pulse Emitter for almost a decade now, and we're no stranger to the transcendental and curative effect his pieces are known to elicit, but never before has the artist succeeded with a project of such grace and breadth as he has now. On Aeons, his newest release for one of Europe's premier experimental outlets, Aguirre Records, Groetsch takes the listener on a journey through four distinct periods of history: ancient earth, Renaissance Europe, the future, and a more distant future in which \"consciousness has been uploaded to computers and people live without bodies.\"\nWhat's remarkable here is the inherently resonant effect of Groetsch's music. Certainly, the experience is open to interpretation and will draw a different response from each listener, but there's something about Groetsch's music that's intuitively \"tuned in\" to humanity's timeless relationship with the transmundane; a metaphysical exploration of the universe and being through music.\" --The Portland Mercury",

            "about": "These are crazy times, it’s easy to get frazzled. But everyone needs moments of tranquility. This is where the new Pulse Emitter album, Chilling in the Eye of the Storm comes in. A peaceful, spacey, minimalist trip through realms light and dark, at the confluence of a comfy earthy vibe, and escapist science fiction dreamings. His recent progressions continue, combining electronic synthesis with global percussion and field recordings. If you need to chill out friends, you are welcome here.\nReleased on Pulse Emitter’s Expansive label, which has a new look designed by Joe Bastardo. Also in this batch is the prior album, Through the Portal, which was released in a small edition on Phinery in Denmark and sold out fast.\nChrome tapes duplicated and imprinted at NAC. Premium cardstock J-cards.",

Combining his growling modular synthesizer patterns with sweeping keyboard motifs, the beauty and vastness of the universe is evoked in five movements, each based on nebulas, galaxies, etc. The sections morph into one another for one epic prog synth journey. CD in jewel case, mastered by Timothy Stollenwerk, art by Daniel Lopatin. The first release on Daryl Groetsch's private press label, Expansive.\"\n\"Self-released CD from Pulse Emitter aka Daryl Groetsch. With titles like \"Eagle Nebula\" and \"Pleiades Cluster\" as well as a dedication to \"beings on other worlds also admiring the stars\", Cosmic Images is set for the heart of the sun, a beautiful series of outer space meditations that connect contemporary synth styles to the gothic black hole of Zeit-era Tangerine Dream/Cyborg-era Klaus Schulze. Sure, there are a whole bunch of solo synth cosmonauts out there right now, but Groetsch is the master of revelatory cosmo-drama and this is possibly his most \"beautiful\" set to date, Artwork by Daniel Lopatin. Recommended.\" -David Keenan/Volcanic Tongue",

            "about": "With an array of handmade modular and vintage keyboard synthesizers Daryl Groetsch crafts melodic and layered compositions that evoke microscopic and interstellar landscapes inspired by nature, science fiction and the cosmos. Groetsch has been working under the Pulse Emitter monicker since 2002, composing and recording in his Portland, OR home studio. Writer David Keenan has called Pulse Emitter “the undisputed king of planetary scale synth hypnosis” and has said, “no one is making synth music that feels so organic, so rapturous and so ‘in tune’ with the contours of outer and inner space as Groetsch.”\nInspiration for Crater Lake came from a spiritually moving camping trip Groetsch took to Crater Lake National Park in Oregon where he found it to be one of the most stunningly beautiful places he had ever been. At the time he was conceptualizing an album inspired by the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and noticing similarities between the features of Crater Lake and the moons caused Groetsch to create an album influenced by both the nature in front of him and the cosmos above.\nOn Crater Lake Groetsch delivers his most intricately composed pieces yet by experimenting with melody and pattern synchronization. Groetsch’s working method begins with conceptualizing each piece and then composing on paper, MIDI sequencing the tracks, synth programming, and finally recording and mixing.\nCrater Lake was mastered and cut to vinyl by Andreas [LUPO] Lubich in Berlin and is pressed on high quality virgin vinyl, packaged in a full color jacket featuring cover artwork from Will Hutchinson. Crater Lake is the first full length Pulse Emitter album on Immune following the side-long contribution to Immune’s 2012 Record Store Day 4 way split release.",

The ship is waiting though, and the tension is building up heavily with every spin of this record, heavy meditative aircraft static blurr slowing down your usual codeine rhythm! Modular synth carpets at its nastiest! you'll be purring when you're on the actual boat.. thick like your mommy's wallet, yet sparse droning that'll get you more \"out there\" than Bob Marley at his vaguest. 2 pieces pushing your brains to one side if the volume is right. Limited to 300 copies, comes in a neon green and black sleeve by Ulf F Faefs.\"",

            "about": "Released by the BEER ON THE RUG label.\nbeerontherug.bandcamp.com\n\"Jam Digital Rainforest and marvel at how fluidly Groetsch constructs his labrinythine sessions from a sonic palette closer to Far Side Virtual than And The Stars Go With You. Sparked in a literal sense by his acquisition of new and customized voice libraries for his synthesizers, Groetsch spins out melodic leads and consonant backdrops that mimic the tones of steel drums, bells, brass, and human vocal formants. Far from diluting his typically lush compositions, these patches embellish his ideas with surprising textures and physical presences. Digital Rainforest transplants the MIDI muzak familiarity and sterile tones of what we might know as “vaporwave” (and the library music that inspires it) into the realm of meticulously layered analog performance, sketching a personalized vision of synthesized music at the crossroads of disparate decades and traditions.\" --Tiny Mix Tapes",

Daryl Groetsch stuffs each of his sessions to bursting with intricately interlocked leads, glistening analog textures, and slowly evolving harmonic structures. His work bridges the gap between deliberate kosmiche arrangements and ecstatic improvisation, and remains the drone/noise underground’s most vibrant connection to the New Age movement of the previous century. As with any Pulse Emitter release, I listen to Equinox and emit four or five audible “Ooooooh”s per track.\" --Tiny Mix Tapes",

While Groetsch’s long-running project turned a new leaf earlier this year with the acoustic flourishes of his self-released Alien Vacation cassette, Euphoria is pure tonal meditation through expansive electronics and heedless curiosity. The airy chords and glockenspiel-led melody of “Cold Sun 5” prepare the senses for the effervescent flow of “Endless Secretion,” which drifts along with a slow and steady bob of aquatic tones. B-side opener “Cold Sun 3” continues the fluorescent narrative with oddly-angled rhythm and weightless momentum. Closer “Silent Euphoria” is one of Groetsch’s deepest efforts on tape yet, flooding the space with layer upon layer of processed elation.\" --Sacred Phrases",

            "about": "Originally released as a C50 cassette on Tranquility Tapes.\ntranquilitytapes.bandcamp.com\n\"It's an honor to present new work by one of the most talented and dedicated purveyors of synthesizer music working today: Portland's Daryl Groetsch. Inspired by the environmental majesty surrounding Groetsch's home in the Pacific Northwest, Forest, Mountain, Valley explores the allure and mystery of nature through three long form compositions. Each movement unfolds with utmost patience, utilizing space brilliantly as they are paradoxically minimal in structure and dynamics, yet bursting at the seams with raw beauty and emotion. Recorded in pristine fidelity and played with precision, synthesizer tones are stunningly present, allowing gorgeous melodies to envelop the ears entirely. In just under an hour, Groetsch takes the listener on an entire journey: from the climb, to the vista, and finally to the descent. Just sit back and let the master be your guide. On pro-dubbed and imprinted chrome cassettes, featuring designs by Caroline Teagle.\" --Tranquility Tapes",

            "about": "Originally released as a limited edition C50 cassette on Cylindrical Habitat Modules.\n\"One of the biggest landmarks in the CHM discography thus far, can barely contain my excitement to be dropping a new tape for Daryl Groetsch's PULSE EMITTER project. One of the most consistently phenomenal and completely underrated artists out there, with one of the most spot-on, incredibly conceptual releases I've heard in a while. Based completely on watching a lava lamp, Daryl's unearthly modular waves ooze and melt in the trademark Pulse Emitter fashion. This one has kind of a \"Meditative Music 2\" vibe, with crackling pulsations and hollow Elaine Radigue-style drones that transfix as the lamp does. \"Starts out pretty cold, then warms up, just like the lamp\". Side B represents the lamp in full swing; \"Rising Columns, Falling Orbs\"... Some of the most ominous and oddly beautiful creep-waves I've ever heard. Just floating by. Guaranteed to turn your brain into an amorphous, shifting blob of wax, and the rest of your body into a statuesque, unable-to-move column of light and water. Mind-boggling and truly spot-on, conceptually. One of my favorite Pulse Emitter joints for sure, could not be more proud to release this. Edition of 100 with full-color cardstock covers and labeled tapes.\" --Cylindrical Habitat Modules",

            "about": "Pulse Emitter’s Meditative Music series captures an artist’s dedication to evolution through years of traversing a myriad of textural and contemplative terrains. Active in the ambient, drone, and noise scenes of Portland, OR since the early 2000s, Pulse Emitter (the project of Daryl Groetsch) has grown fathoms since the project’s inception, from Groetsch’s humble homemade synthesizer, to his embrace of the worlds of possibility digital instruments and processing could unfold. Originally self-released in four annual installments from 2007-2010, with a fifth installment recorded in 2015, Meditative Music is a series whose arc is as informed as much by the meditative intent of each piece as it is indicative of Pulse Emitter’s ability to explore and cultivate sounds with unmatched subtlety.\nA classically trained musician, Groetsch began experimenting with electronic music in the late 1990’s, just before moving to Portland. Inspired by the Music From the Hearts of Space radio program, and the Berlin School of electronic music, Groetsch moved from building his modular synthesizer and creating noisy dronescapes to incorporating melodic, sequencer driven arrangements, to layered vintage analog synthesizers, to implementing acoustic world instruments and digital iPad technology. These shifts in process and instrumentation are emblematic of Pulse Emitter’s progression as a project, discovering new ways to develop expansive tapestries of sound.\nWhere much of Pulse Emitter’s material incorporates more biting, abrasive, and immediate sounds, the Meditative Music series found Groetsch setting parameters of himself that served more as inspiration than inhibition. By creating music for specific purposes Groetsch was able to elaborate on the journey of each movement without losing focus on the specific feel of the piece. Volume 1 retains a sense of neutrality, evoking a gentle-yet-determined air, well suited for his partner’s massage practice. The emulated babbling brook of Volume 2 captures the relaxing essence of a hike through natural landscapes, where Volume 4’s unobtrusive pillars of drone beckon one’s thoughts towards slumber.\nWith each volume of Meditative Music, Pulse Emitter embarks on an adventure through unique realms, incorporating swaths of warm synth tones that ooze like magma, glowing until it solidifies and weathers away with time. The slow progressions that make up these pieces are akin to watching a time lapse that resembles slow motion: every gesture is clearly felt and purposefully plotted, exhaling in a welcoming wash that blossoms into new passages. In composing such slow moving, extended pieces, the deliberateness inherent to Groetsch’s compositional mapping required exceptionally patient ears to construct, yet allows the hour long pieces to impose any demands upon the listener. Parallel to the paradoxes of many meditative practices, these pieces are at once passive and active, engaging with every one of these movements with enough space to also sweep past the senses.",

            "about": "Modular Synthesizer, Daryl Groetsch. November 7-15, 2008, Portland, Oregon. Originally released as CD on Digitalis Arts & Crafts Editions in 2009. Cover art by Brad Rose.\n\"I've been a fan of Daryl Groetsch AKA Pulse Emitter's synthetic concoctions for years now. Hailing from the hotbed of Portland, Oregon, his work is almost unparalleled when it comes to modular synthesizer excursions. \"Oppressive Nature\" is a 40 minute journey into cities that will soon be lost and overrun to the wilderness. The thematic idea behind the album is nature's inevitable reclamation of the concrete jungles we've constructed and amassed. Where Groetsch truly succeeds on \"Oppressive Nature\" is creating such an organic landscape with his synth. His work here is highly focused and dialed-in. Through the static and electronic waves something warm and almost triumphant emerges. Heavy saw waves weave a chaotic mass of urban debris, smoothed over by the sine waves of time. Barriers fade away as they consumed by sonic vines that find their way into all these aural cracks. The result is oddly beautiful in an almost post-apocalyptic way. Nature always wins. Limited edition of 500 copies in chipboard gatefolds by Stumptown.\"",

            "about": "Originally released as a C60 cassette on Cosmic Winnetou.\n\"This was the first time Pulse Emitter recorded outside, an idea that he got from Guenter Schlienz, who runs Cosmic Winnetou, when Schlienz was crashing at his house while on tour . “It was very inspirational. It’s normal I guess for an acoustic musician to take their stuff outside but not so much for electronic musicians”. Groetsch said about the jam. “Guenter does this himself a lot, he told me he recorded at a beach in southern France I believe and it informed the way he plays in a major way. He encouraged me to try it. I had actually played an outdoor fest right around the same time and got a taste of it then. Something about seeing the sky and plants while playing is good. The music was improvised using a setup that has become my new favorite way of playing, I’ve done more (inside) recordings in this style since. Playing outside is definitely different with the sun beating down on you and your instruments, and ants crawling over everything, and flying insects, but it’s all part of the experience”.\" --Tabs Out",

            "about": "Originally released as a vinyl LP in an edition of 500, a split label release between Expansive and Cylindrical Habitat Modules.\n\"Major new release from Daryl Groetsch aka Pulse Emitter, still the stand-out performer to come out of the whole cosmo-synth explosion. Spiritual Vistas spans four tracks of heady devotional synth spectra that combine the high gothic mass style of early planet-devouring Tangerine Dream with a deep elemental/environmental feels that is profoundly affecting. Unlike the bulk of the current crop there's little 80s nostalgia or new wave fluff to Groetsch's vision of new synthesized sound. ... No one is making synth music that feels so organic, so rapturous and so 'in tune' with the contours of outer and inner space as Groetsch and this just might be the masterpiece that we've been waiting for from him. You could live inside this. Edition of 500 copies. Highly recommended.\"\n-David Keenan/Volcanic Tongue\n\"If you thought, like I did, that Pulse Emitter could never top last year’s sublime Over Clouds tape on Root Strata, then prepare to receive a sonic slap to the face from Spiritual Vistas, Daryl Groetsch’s newest full-length. This vinyl release comes riding on waves of “album of the year” hype and, with vibes this beautiful, it’s hard to fight it. Constantly developing and changing the ambient synth-gaze scene for the better, I’d say it’s about time we named a solar system after Pulse Emitter. Exciting and vital music. Enormous recommendation.\" --Zen Effects",

            "about": "Originally released on Phinery, Denmark, 12/12/2016\nReissued on Expansive, EE09CS.\n\"There is a constant struggle between the organic and inorganic aspects of our personal nature—an effort aided by the drive to define our own physical boundaries through intangible experiences and ephemeral thoughts. But for Portland-based musician Daryl Groetsch—who records curiously reassuring and intricate synthesizer music as Pulse Emitter—this determination isn’t given credence by volume or density but by an emotional center around which everything else revolves. He peers deeply into our relationship with our environment and positions himself as a mediator of sorts between the fierce wilds of our instincts and the calming constancy of nature. He possesses a particular fascination with the hold that the environment and memory hold over people and discovers mesmerizing ways in which to link each influence to certain emotions.\nScattered across the tracks of his latest release, “Through the Portal,” Groetsch maintains an intimate connection with both his audience and their perceptions of his freewheeling rhythmic insight. Over the course of eight songs, he applies his new age prudence to determine whether individuals have an innate need for natural connections, or whether we’re simply a collection of pinging neurons in the service of a dispassionate body. He surmises that there could be a case made for either reality, but he’s certainly offering us evidence to support the former supposition. Imbued with glacial synth melodies, found sound maneuverings and a mischievous sense of imagination, “Through the Portal” finds Groetsch supplanting all doubts with one of the most beautiful and electronically pastoral releases you’re likely to hear this year.\"",

            "about": "“The latest from the ever-prolific synthesist and experimentalist Pulse Emitter is a formalist exercise in pushing into the unknown galaxy of microtonality—essentially meaning that it consists of intervals and scales not traditionally explored in Western music. This is interesting to us the layperson listeners not because its conceptually groundbreaking, but because great art is often made under rigorous methodologies. And truly this is one of Pulse Emitter’s most wonderful and strange works in a catalog full of them, a collection of landscapes as colorful and alien as anything the ProcGen big bangs in No Man’s Sky have been able to dream out of raw data. It’s a whole new world, crafted with a hand tied behind its creator’s back.” – Noisey / Vice",
            "credits": "released October 3, 2018\nAll of these compositions use tunings other than the common twelve-tone equal temperament (12-TET). The tunings for each piece are as follows:\n7-TET - track 7\n10-TET - track 2\n14-TET - track 4\n19-TET - tracks 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10\n31-TET - track 9\nThis music is 100% electronic, made mostly with software synthesizers.\nPulse Emitter is Daryl Groetsch, in Portland, Oregon.\nCover art by Tiny Little Hammers  tinylittlehammers.com\nCD layout by Joe Bastardo\nReleased on the Expansive label.\nXenharmonic Passages is the outcome of Pulse Emitter’s explorations in microtonalism, specifically various equal temperaments. Experimenting with these tunings the artist found new emotions and colors to work with. These pieces pair a minimalist, ambient style with the creation of alien insect-scapes to complement the otherworldly atmospheres of the microtonal melodies. Each of Xenharmonic Passages’ ten tracks are themselves passageways to other places, real and imaginary. Get ready to relax and be transported with tones from another plane.",
