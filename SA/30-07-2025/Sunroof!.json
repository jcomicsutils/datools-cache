            "about": "Unstoppable collection from long in the tooth UK viber Matthew Bower and friends (who here include Neil Campbell, Rosalie Bower, Richard Youngs, and Jazzfinger). The atmosphere here is mostly spaced and buzzing with instruments and voices hovering and floating in the dense mix, the tunes all running together like some sort of alien shortwave broadcast. Disc 1 takes off from where \"Found Star Sound\" left us, with a mix of fuzzy guitar and organ rhythms jousting with voice, bowed strings, and unidentifiable percussion in a dense fog. Disc 2 is a headlong rush into newish territory, with analog synth vs. birdsong, child's voice vs. sawing violin, chug vs. fizz, etc. There are many tracks on both discs that have subtle (and overt) melodic and rhythmic undercurrents that suggest some sort of alternate fuzz/hiss-dominated universe version of say, Harmonia or Richter Band. Probably a coincidence, but very, very appealing.",

            "about": "Amazing krautrocky collection of pillow sound from Bower & Co. Layers of twinkling keyboard, guitar, unidentified fuzz, short wave, etc. One of their best and most immediately accessible. Very much in the style of Harmonia/Cluster in spots. There's a couple of amped-up moments here, including surprise lead guitar action on \"tornado rose canoe,\" and the excellent fuzzgrilled rock of \"Primavera.\" \"Best Sunroof Ever\" - Neil Campbell.",

            "about": "Feral marks the return of Matthew Bower’s Sunroof! (in the guise of Black Sun Roof), for their first release in 5 years. Quiet since the release of 2007’s blistering Panzer Division Lou Reed (vhf#105), Sunroof! returns here with a more introspective set, reaching back to the fuzzy, spacey sounds of releases like the epic double Bliss. Amongst the drifting, fuzzed out washes of sound, there’s the crude, Dead C-like riffing in “Lions & Peonies” and the lockgrooved tremolo of “Son of the Blue Wolf” (referencing previous triumphs like my personal fave Sunroof! Cloudz).\n“I have a problem w/ the term ‘psychedelia’ ; negative associations of a ‘hippie’ falseness, nevertheless my arte is, I know, deeply psychedelic in a true sense, a kind of synaesthesisia, a scrambling, an overload that seeks Samadhi in its primal gush, that will reconnect one with the all, or rather, a ‘black psychedelia’, substituting the elective current, for ‘all’…” – Matthew Bower\nIn addition to the all-new tracks on the LP, the package also includes a bonus CD (in a separate sleeve) featuring an MB-curated overview of his work. Many of the tracks on the 75 min Zebra Blood CD are from scarce or out of print recordings, including “Austrian Shade” from an impossible-to-find Total 7”. Also included is the epic and exclusive new track SPIRIT ANIMAL DANZIG.",

            "about": "Spacy and sorta mellow follow up to 2000's monster double pack debut Delicate Autobahn Under Construction. Recorded mostly at Bower's Cumbrian home in the rainy and windy UK \"lake\" district, Found Star Soundlayers droning guitars, organs, violin, and voice with intermittent twinkling percussion to evoke an atmosphere perfectly suited to such an environment. Following a short living-room-organ-with-built in-rhythm-section-gone-crazy intro on \"Pink Stream 1,\" the album builds a vibe around Bower's thickly buzzing (but smooth n' mild) guitar. Steadily picking up momentum, the music peaks with the chugging sound of trains epic \"Pink Stream 2,\" calms briefly , and then goes out strong with a rousing blast of guitar and violin scrape on \"Silvera.\" \"Another scuff from the UK's biggest scuffmakers!\" - Seymour Glass.",

            "about": "Beneath the usual lovely psychedelic artwork on the cover of Panzer Division Lou Reed lurks Sunroof’s most explosive and assaultive record ever. The key track here in the Sunroof! evolution is the opening “Slew Plateaus #1,” with Mick Flower (Vibracathedral Orchestra) on guitar and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man) on drums. This live shot of electricity gradually ramps up from Matt Bower and Mick Flower’s dueling guitars to when Moloney’s drums come crashing in after about six minutes, leading to a furious crescendo that lasts for the remainder of the 19 minute track. “Slew Plateaus #2” is a lengthy collaboration with underground gadabout Mattin, whose previous collabs with Tony Conrad, Bruce Russell, Eddie Prevost et al hopefully prepared him for the MB wrecking ball which is delivered here. The other two cuts are absolutely blistering demolition work, which in spite of their visceral impact, reach a state of zen-like stasis after a couple of minutes, ala the best of MB’s work with Hototogisu.",

            "about": "An epic double CD of inimitable buzz from the long running Sunroof! team. Recorded over a period where Matt Bower concentrated on his duo Hototogisu (with Marcia Bassett of Double Lepoards), \"Silver Bear Mist\" backtracks from recent joints like the collag-y \"USSA,\" \"Splat,\" and \"Wings Over America,\" and the last major Sunroof! release - the krautrock-ish \"Cloudz\" (vhf#75) - to revel in thick billowing fuzz bombs. Aided by Vibracathedral Orchestra's Mick Flower and US duo the Skaters, MB lets rip on \"rockers\" like the Tibetan-oriented \"Buried in the Sky\" and the immense \"Sky Blue Sword.\" Disc 2 mixes it up a bit, with the unexpectedly docile \"Stacked Diamonds\" featuring the Skaters, alongside the scouring surge of MB leads on \"Be Sure to Boogie\" and \"Luminous Kite.\"",
