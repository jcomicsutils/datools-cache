            "about": "in 2012, a friend of mine sent me some music that I had recorded to cassette tape in the early to mid-90's from an old Ensoniq sq1 synthesizer which I had purchased while in graduate school in 1991.\n6 of these tracks, recorded in 1996 and 1997, would make up the Times Escape album which I submitted to the Wearall ghosts label in early January of 2013. That album was released in February of that year and began my journey of being an ambient musician after taking a 17 year break after I had originally recorded the tracks for Times Escape.\nOver the next 2 years, I would submit tracks to various compilations, begin collaborating with a couple of people and submit albums to different internet labels.\nIt wasn't until 2015 that I would set up my own bandcamp page and start releasing music myself and begin to network and collaborate with even more artists from all over the world.\n10 years later, with 500 albums, including 100 collaborations with people from the United States, Canada, Finland, the UK, Israel, Germany, Poland, Russia, Holland, Norway, The Ukraine, Iraq and Scotland, I present you with a celebration of my first decade as a member of the best and most close knit community of musicians and fans that exist in the world.\nI went through my entire catalog, selecting what are the most popular tracks based on reviews and bandcamp commentary so this will be a comprehensive introduction to my work for those who may not be familiar with it.\nmy sincere thanks and appreciation goes to my many fans, the people with whom I have had great experience collaborating, friends who have encouraged me to embrace new technologies and most of all, to my beautiful wife who has been of great support of my musical ambitions as long as we have known each other.",

In turn, he sent me 6 tracks to add my artistry to and as a result, we've come up with an interesting album that went beyond our wildest expectations.\nThis has truly been a pleasure to work on, an experiment in unexpected but delightful directions for both of us as artists and explorers of sound and imagination.",

            "about": "The title of this work reflects a faceless presence, a universality that is being implemented in the future of healthcare which the concept is a rejection of by the very dark nature of the music and it's mood.\nThe fact that we are becoming nothing more than statistical data and account numbers... Our individuality growing more obsolete with each passing year is presented as a fundamental change to the human condition in some cases where we are simply nothing more than numerical constructs to the government and major corporations who are taking over our lives more and more each day.\nThough the concept in this recording is just demonstrated in one area, it is still a universal outcry of the people of a nation whose government is doing more than simply overseeing the individuals they are supposed to represent.\nThe ever-growing body of officials are not satisfied with merely leading, they want to control every aspect of every individual life and create a \"we\" and do away with the \"I\".\nThis then, is my personal protest against the radical elimination of personal freedom and dignity for each individual and it is my hope, that after hearing this music, you, the listener, if you've felt a sense of your personal freedom lost in whatever aspect of your life is important, that you will be able to take small steps, which can lead to giant leaps to regain that which has been eroded over the years by governing bodies who believe that we are not individuals, but simply parts of a giant collective.",

I would also like to give thanks to Rebekkah Hilgraves for providing an outstanding reading of the monologue on the introductory track.\nI also owe a great deal of thanks to the freesound project and the people who uploaded sounds I used in the recording: knarmahfox (1), NoiseCollector (3), sindhu.tms (3, 4, 5), ondrosik (4), guitarguy1985 (5), StaryTlustyKocour (6), 11linda (6) and Corsica_S (7).\"",

            "about": "Being one of many, who I'm sure are uploading albums of a similar title, since this is a rather unique date in the history of time, I thought I would contribute efforts to this cause. I was going to follow the advice that I gave to Mike Benoit and do an album of 22 tracks which would each be 2 minutes and 22 seconds but decided against it as I tend to shine more brightly in the arena of long-form compositions and improvisations.\nSo, to that end, I did an ambient live set on YouTube this morning using Reaktor's screwell, shaped sound in real-time then imported that recorded improvisation back into komplete, where I added some additional effects and sampled it at a slightly lowered pitch to alter the sound a bit more.",

            "about": "Walking along the cold dark streets of the city, you stumble upon the ruins of an old library. intrigued, you enter and while exploring the ruins, you come upon a tattered old manuscript which details a history you've only heard about from the days of your childhood by way of stories told to you by descendants of people who have lived the horror of which you are about to read.\nScanning the pages, your brought back in time to the early 21st century when there was global unrest, corruption, fraud and encroaching tyranny upon a land that, for the most part, used to enjoy many freedoms and liberties.\nYou can hear the protests of the people in the streets, feel the anxiety of the marginalized and get a sense of the impending isolation that was foisted upon the people for political expediency of those who were artificially swept to power.\nYou've got hindsight on your side and even though you knew it didn't have to be this way, you still wept for man's lack of empathy for his fellow humans as many of them tried to navigate a society that was quickly collapsing around them, a collapse which was engineered by the most reprehensible, vile and demonic men of the current age, a plan that the corporations, media and politicians all happily engaged in to brainwash the people and make them come to the conclusion that their very freedom and liberty was not necessary for their ultimate happiness.\nIt was easier than even the elitists imagined to make most of the citizens become slaves to their own desire for health, safety and convenience. The ones protesting this new world order, which was really all about micro management of every single detail of the lives of the people were the ones who were deemed subversive and selfish and therefore had to be banished from society as they were the greatest threat to the plan of total and absolute control of every individual on the planet.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nThis is an album of tracks that have previously been released on various compilations over the years, though, as far as I can tell, some of them are no longer available on the internet so some of these tracks are presented exclusively on this album of noise and industrial ambience.",

Tombaugh in 1930. In honor of that occasion, I have created a sonic journey that will take you, the listener, on a journey from the doorstep of the Pluto system, towards the chaotically rotating moons of Pluto and finally to the outer reaches of the Kuiper Belt where Nasa will encounter other spacial bodies in 2019.\nCredits:\nArtwork by Bill Helms\naovi-ontol.deviantart.com",

            "about": "My vision in creating this compilation was to give new listeners a sample of my vast discography on Bandcamp in a concise manner while also giving people who have heard my music an opportunity to hear some unreleased tracks. The almost 2.5 hours of music was carefully mixed for a cohesive listening experience with an appropriate point for burning the collection on cd. Links for the individual albums are listed below as a reference for further exploration of my sonic imaginings.\n\"The intricacies of compositional structure and arrangement from Scott Lawlor have fascinated me, ever since I heard That Sanguine Light of November, so it is with excitement that I now enter the realm of this compilation called A Journey into Sound and Mind (an Introduction to the World of Scott Lawlor).\nThat journey begins with the chiming of the bell and a segment of footsteps that seemed to lead us through the corridors of musical mystery and mastery, on the piece Peine forte et dure. This clever link leads us directly to Show Me the Glint of Light. There is a certain ambience about Lawlor’s work, however on this long form track, we not only have that, we can also be a part of a piece that has a rich opening melodic start, and one that morphs directly into an old style of New Age music, that is seemingly making somewhat of a comeback these days. Listen carefully now to Show Me the Glint of Light, the build and progression of the composition, and the added layers upon layers of creative cleverness, that go to making this a most appealing offering, are a delight to listen to.\nOn The bureaucrats discover that the patient isn’t enrolled, apart from being a fascinating title header, is a deep and almost disturbing slice of dark ambient music. I have to add that that when you listen to the arrangement of the piece and sample the production quality of it, it is stunning. The narrative itself is dark and deep and this could easily be a soundtrack for a nightmare, perhaps the nightmare of a child in great distress!\nThis collection of works from Lawlor highlights his work in a most graphic way; take a listen now to Pain Can Give Access to Evil, a composition that flows from the dark corners of the previous track, and its constant reverberation of intent and sounds. Here is a mist filled realm of nowhere, a musical null space. I have a piece of art work that we once constructed called The Beach of Lost Souls; this would be the perfect musical partner for that. Whilst listening to this moody composition, one always feels on high alert for something jumping out of the shadows at you, the tension in this piece is incredible.\nA slightly shorter composition now at just short of seven minutes is laid on our musical palette and called Feeling Tears. There is still a sense of a hovering uncertainty here, but one that has a deep sense of emotion built into its structure. The keyboards create a moment of sadness, but that sadness comes from a sense of realisation, perhaps a moment of truth and release. Scott Lawlor has really manifested something quite moving on this piece.\nWe slowly move deeper into this musical labyrinth of many moods and come across an ambient opus called, Where Blinking Embers Scarcely Grow. This is one I recommend you listen to a few times over; the performance here is captivating, and we have just over eleven minutes to enjoy a track that at times wends its way cleverly around the genres of Classical and Ambient, with a hint of minimalism. I personally found this piece very addictive to listen to and it has become one of my favourites from the release.\nWith time and attention we now arrive at our next port of call and come across a piece called Winds of Neptune. Now we mentioned ambience earlier on and on this piece you can hear it at its best. In Eno style, Lawlor is not afraid to use silence to illustrate his narrative and one could easily imagine sitting on the surface of this planet in light body form, and enjoying this vast musical oasis, whilst viewing the entire cosmos from this remote location, what a totally amazing arrangement, enjoy the wind chimes of Neptune.\nWith a certain warmth Lawlor moves us onto another piece called Brings a Warm Glow, the light energy of the keyboards here, brings a real feel good track into our view, a gentle melody and flute sounds almost give us a little “Deuter” moment to revel in.\nFrom that state of almost reverie, we now move back into a more mournful repose, and once again an arrangement that has a slight hint of the classical. I remember vividly a piece called Pavane for a Dead Princess by Ravel and then later on Winter Tress by Kevin Kendle, there are similarities to both, but on the Pain of Being Fractured, Lawlor takes us one stage further in a performance that is deeply moving and emotive, but very real in its overall feel, one can also sense within the music, a deep reality and honesty, perhaps acceptance as well, no matter how hard the challenge is ahead.\nFinal Exit is a musical horse of a different colour, the emphasis here is more rooted in an electronically styled arrangement, but listen for those subtle nuances, especially around the six minute mark, when a whole new segment opens up that seems to create a portal to a new realm of tone, which is far more ambient in its construction, but almost Vangelis in approach, an extremely clever composition indeed.\nMystical Dance, Which Yonder Starry Sphere is up next, there was something a little Pink Floyd about the start here that reminded me in parts of the more electronic vibe they gave. That soon gave way to one of the most amazing slices of EM music pieces I have heard since the great Isao Tomita. This is a vast opus of sight and sound to take in, its range and creation of tone is sublime, and yes, this is yet another one of my personal favourites from the release. Mystical Dance, Which Yonder Starry Sphere, could be music from the orbs, this grand soundscape of well over 14 minutes is enough to pacify any long form fan, or simply a person who wishes to dive in deep and fully immerse themselves in a whole new dimension of musical genius, “Mystical Dance, Which Yonder Starry Sphere, and of planets fixed in all her wheels”, thank you John Milton, perhaps that Paradise once lost, can be found again, within this composition.\nFrom that sublime moment of grandeur, we’re about to enter another, this one is called Encountering the Ghostly Vision of Tatyana Prikhodko. I must admit I researched this one and found the story of a Russian National who butchered his family, both disturbing and dark; those atrocities have been laid to music, with a swirling effect on keyboards and with the added use of audio news segments of that time, in what is yet another addictive and engrossing piece from the artist.\nNow many musicians passed on in 2016, but here on One World Music Radio many of our presenters were saddened to have lost the talents of one Edgar Froese. On Dreaming the Timeless Dream (a Tribute to Edgar Froese), we have over 15 minutes of eternal music from Scott Lawlor that may well take you back to the days of Tangerine Dream. The performance by Lawlor here is timed to perfection, and creatively arranged to give you a quarter of an hour to just sit and be in the moment with your memories.\nWe seem to have arrived at the borderlands of our penultimate piece. This little gem is called A Thousand Miles of Moonlight. The piano here drives a purposeful, but gentle narrative, along with a feeling of awe and splendour; there is also something rather cinematic about this composition. This carefully crafted track really creates a wonderful ageless feel within the music and allows the listener plenty of room to investigate within.\nSo our last offering, this last gift from the artist is The Curse of The Chamber of Tears. We end our sojourn with the musician with a return to the tones of mystery and imagination on this ten minute composition. Scott Lawlor will take you on a veritable ghost ride, and you will never know what to expect. What a stunning performance to end with, an electronically gifted slice of dark ambience that draws you deep within its chamber of tears, and leaves you in no uncertain terms that you have probably just listened to one of the most ominous compositions off the album.\nScott Lawlor has placed fifteen tracks on this release, an introduction to his work. His gifts and talents are displayed here and no one can doubt the artistry and compositional skills of the musician. His style is creative to say the least and those fans of high class electronic ambient arrangements, will be totally in there element, but for those out there who have a need to try something different, try something that is spacious, thought provoking and superbly produced and arranged, then you really need to give this album a shot, it’s a work of genius unleashed.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio\nwww.oneworldmusic.co.uk/scott-lawlor/4593904746\nnotes from CandyL\nThis is a remarkable anthology of the music of Scott Lawlor. It truly represents Scotts' wonderfully diverse composing style. And is deep and meaningful, with equal parts intelligence and emotion, observation and introspection, pain and optimism. This collection offers an array of ambient pieces, from delicate melodies and synths, to dark and dispirited, to hard driving, metal inspired, experimental. Even some Space and Berlin style ambient. There are delicately deep pieces like Where Blinking Embers Scarcely Glow. Dark pieces like the excerpt from The Bureaucrats Discover That The Patient Isn't Covered and Encountering The Ghostly Image Of Tatyana Prikhodko. Lovely melodic pieces like The Pain Of Being Fractured. Emotional pieces like Feeling Tears, swelling with a sea of synths, approaching and receding.\nScott also included some lovely live pieces from Stillstream performances, like an excerpt from Winds Of Neptune. Brings A Warm Glow is a nice Berlin style piece.\nI would say that this artist has been successful with his mission to present an introduction to his music. This is a well constructed view of the world of Scott Lawlor.\nwww.candylmusic.com\ntrack 1 is from Ambient Online Compilation: Volume 4\nambientonline.bandcamp.com/album/ambient-online-compilation-volume-4\ntrack 2 is from Show me the Glint of Light\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/show-me-the-glint-of-light\ntrack 3 is from 2161866618216\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/2161866618216\ntracks 4 and 5 are from Child of Rage\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/child-of-rage\ntrack 8 is from Show me the Glint of Light\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/show-me-the-glint-of-light\nTrack 10 is from AlbumInADay/Vol10\nwww.bfwrecordings.com/releases/AlbumInADay/Vol10/\ntrack 11 is from The Dark Descent and Up to Reascend\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/the-dark-descent-and-up-to-reascend\ntrack 13 is from Legacy and Evolution: A Tribute to Edgar Froese\nradbob.bandcamp.com/album/legacy-and-evolution-a-tribute-to-edgar-froese\ntrack 14 is from revelations from the lightest side of the secret moon\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/revelations-from-the-lightest-side-of-the-secret-moon\ntrack 15 is from Ambient Online Compilation: Volume 7\nambientonline.bandcamp.com/album/ambient-online-compilation-volume-7",

I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nThis album is comprised of two tracks improvised on the Roland FA08 synthesizer, most likely in 2018 or 2019. For the 6 years that I owned this synthesizer, it has been instrumental in assisting me in producing a vast body of work, a lot of which, is still unpublished at this point.",

            "about": "This was originally published on the Earthmantra label in 2019 so if you purchased it back then, please don't buy it from my site.\n\"The idea that something is dying needs to be investigated to see what it is. It is not we who are really dying but only the false self that is experiencing the end of its illusory view of life — our personal, homemade self, which has been the object of our efforts and is secretly present in virtually all of our good deeds.\nWhat’s dying is not the deepest self, but our dependence and over-identification with the mental ego and its projects, and our cultural conditioning and over-identification with it, including our roles in life.\nFrom this perspective, the dying process is the culmination or the peak of the whole development of the spiritual journey, in which total surrender to God involves the gift of life itself, as we know it.\nFor that reason it’s not really death, but life reaching out to a fullness that we can’t imagine from this side of the dying process.\nSo death is . . . the final completion of this process of becoming fully alive and manifesting the triumph of the grace of God in us.\"\nThomas Keating with Carl J. Arico, The Gift of Life: Death & Dying, Life & Living Companion Book\n\"Death could be looked upon as the birth canal into eternal life. A little confining and scary, maybe, yet it’s the passage into a vastly fuller life. Eternal life means perfect happiness without space or time limitations. It is spaciousness itself. You begin to taste it in deep contemplative prayer. You realize that you don’t give it to yourself; it’s already within you.\"\nThomas Keating, From the Mind to the Heart\n\"Our new body will be spiritualized and not limited to its present physical presence and limitations. One aspect of creation is that, once you have been born into this world, you never die because, as the Hindu religions teach, each of us possesses deep within us an inalienable spark of divine love.\"\nThomas Keating and Joseph Boyle with Lucette Verboven, World Without End\nI found these three tracks when I was listening to some of my unreleased archives during the time shortly after Joe Lawlor's first angelversary, the day before Thanksgiving of 2018 and still not feeling in a space to celebrate the holidays, I listened to these improvised space pieces in the background while reading my email. Finding the above quotations seemed to put into words what the music was conveying to me and looking at the dates on the tracks, I discovered that I wrote them between September 27 and October 10, 2017...just a short time before he would return to his true home.\nAs I have said on notes of other albums where I attempt to process all that has happened, the pain I feel is because of the emptiness of Joe's absence from my life but these tracks provide a foreshadowing of what his soul must have been experiencing during those last weeks, an inexorable pull toward the eternal love and light of the great divine, a theme that I would subsequently explore in later albums.\nThis album then, is the lost link between Look Unto the Heavens and Transition and I hope that the music herein will bring you a sense of comfort and peace as it has me during this difficult occasion.",

            "about": "All night, all day, in dizzy, downward flight, Fell the wild-whirling, vague, chaotic snow, Till every landmark of the earth below, Trees, moorlands, roads, and each familiar sight Were blotted out by the bewildering white. And winds, now shrieking loud, now whimpering low, Seemed lamentations for the world-old woe That death must swallow life, and darkness light.\nBut all at once the rack was blown away, The snowstorm hushing ended in a sigh; Then like a flame the crescent moon on high Leaped forth among the planets; pure as they, Earth vied in whiteness with the Milky Way: Herself a star beneath the starry sky\nA Winter Landscape by Mathilde Blind\nTracks recorded between June and August 2015",

            "about": "\"Losing one's shadow was viewed in pre-modern times as a curse: vampires had no shadows (as they could not show up in a mirror), nor possessed ghosts a shadow. A romantic novel reflects this belief: Peter Schlemihl sells his - supposedly worthless - shadow to the devil... and troubled by the immanent feeling of loss of his personality tries then during his whole life to regain his shadow, but in vain.\"\n\"Our shadow is often subconscious, hidden even from our own awareness. It takes effort and life-long practice to look for, find, and embrace what we dismiss and what we disdain. After spending so much energy avoiding the appearance of failure, it will take a major paradigm shift in consciousness to integrate our shadow. One of the great surprises on the human journey is that we come to full consciousness precisely by shadowboxing, facing our own contradictions, and making friends with our own mistakes and failings.\"\nFalling Upward, Richard Rohr, OFM\nTechnical notes on the album:\nFabio had sent me an improvisation on a drone that I had emailed him for the \"Scott Lawlor And Friends 4\" album but since I changed the theme and deadline of the album, I thought it better to repurpose the track for another project, to which he was agreeable.\nI imported the original collaboration into the Native Instruments sampler on the komplete kontrol keyboard, creating an even darker and longer dronescape. I improvised over that with a number of instruments such as Bioscape from Luftrum, extreme Vocal Environments, alien Skies and Deep Impact made by zero-g, Vento Modern Woodwinds by Heavyocity, Raw Strings by Sudden Audio and the percussion is from Damage 1 also created by Heavyocity.\nI wanted to create a journey that started calm, grew with intensity and then came back to a less intense but still dark conclusion as a way to reflect on the visitation with what were, perhaps, previously unknowable parts of the shadow self which required exploration.",

            "about": "To celebrate the feast day of St. Thomas Aquinas, the greatest philosopher and Theologian of the Catholic faith, I present two reinterpretations of the Adoro Te Devote, which he wrote in the 12th century for his personal prayer and time of meditation.\n\"Godhead here in hiding, whom I do adore,\nMasked by these bare shadows, shape and nothing more,\nSee, Lord, at thy service low lies here a heart\nLost, all lost in wonder at the God thou art.\nSeeing, touching, tasting are in thee deceived:\nHow says trusty hearing? that shall be believed;\nWhat God's Son has told me, take for truth I do;\nTruth himself speaks truly or there's nothing true.\nOn the cross thy godhead made no sign to men,\nHere thy very manhood steals from human ken:\nBoth are my confession, both are my belief,\nAnd I pray the prayer of the dying thief.\nI am not like Thomas, wounds I cannot see,\nBut can plainly call thee Lord and God as he;\nLet me to a deeper faith daily nearer move,\nDaily make me harder hope and dearer love.\nO thou our reminder of Christ crucified,\nLiving Bread, the life of us for whom he died,\nLend this life to me then: feed and feast my mind,\nThere be thou the sweetness man was meant to find.\nBring the tender tale true of the Pelican;\nBathe me, Jesu Lord, in what thy bosom ran—\nBlood whereof a single drop has power to win\nAll the world forgiveness of its world of sin.\nJesu, whom I look at shrouded here below,\nI beseech thee send me what I thirst for so,\nSome day to gaze on thee face to face in light\nAnd be blest forever with thy glory's sight. Amen.\"",

            "about": "A long walk through some desolate desert lands starts our adventure here. A dark and tall man finds ways to open doors between time and space to create a team of elite gunslingers. They travel great lengths and venture through lost worlds of dead technology from those long since past. Stories are shared and lessons are learned. Battles are fought and struggles are endored....some won, some lost. The ka-tet continues on through all and grows stronger and perseveres. Finally the final battle...and conquest comes to pass and the dark and tall stands proud at the top of the tower....all to find himself right where he started in the first place..\nScott and I both hope you enjoy this voyage into lands unspoken, and unknown to us. We thank you for all of your support and bid you good luck on your own voyages.. Long days and pleasant nights to you all.",

House of the Maker & Scott Lawlor take the listener on a two hour long journey through ancient forests uninhabited by humans, wintry frozen worlds, mysterious dream planes, and a place in the blackest of nights that few dare travel to (or return from).\nThis is music for the nocturnal hours and a place to find comfort in the gloom.\n“And I Fell into Darkness and Foul Dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse,” is a phrase from J.R.R. Tolkien’s, ‘The Return of the King,’ Chapter 10: The Tower of Corith Ungol",
            "credits": "released February 22, 2021\nHouse of the Maker's portion of this album was created in September of 2020. The field recordings were captured in various locations in months/years past. Scott Lawlor's contributions to this album were recorded in January 2021.\nAll album photos/layout by House of the Maker.\"",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on\nvery explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nAndromimetophilia is a paraphilia involving sexual attraction to transgender individuals who have transitioned female-to-male, and women who present as\nmen. The objects of an andromimetophile’s affections are said to be andromimetic. Andromimetophilia is the opposite of gynemimetophilia.\nThe term comes from the Greek words andros, meaning man, mimos, meaning mime or impersonate, and philia, meaning attachment. The term was coined by sexologists\nJohn Money and Malgorzata Lamacz.\nAndromimetophilia is classed as a stigmatic-eligibilic paraphilia, because those who are desired by andromimetophiles may feel they are a stigma to other\nmembers of society. It’s thought that this type of paraphilia stems from key events in childhood which “deform” or alter the adult’s idea of what is sexually\nattractive, and what is not.\nThe term andromimetophilia is somewhat controversial in the transgender community, as it implies that female-to-male transgender individuals are merely\n“impersonating” men, in the same way that drag kings are. However others believe that andromimetophilia simply refers to an attraction to the shared consciousness\nof wishing to present as male, that both drag kings and female-to-male transgender individuals possess.\nOther critics of the term suggest that calling an attraction to transgender individuals a paraphilia creates a stigma which is damaging to transgender\nindividuals.",

            "about": "Last year, around this time, I released Theotokos, an album of short tracks inspired by the advent meditations given by Rev. Kimberly Braun.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/theotokos\nOne year later, she reached out to me and asked me if I would be open to composing original minimal music to serve as the background for the meditations of the current Advent season.\nI was honored that she would make such a request and have been enjoying creating these tracks and so have decided to release them for your listening pleasure and perhaps for your personal journey of spiritual growth and meditation, if you have such a belief system.",

            "about": "\"Nox Intempesta continue to plumb the depths of dark ambience with four very\nlong-form tracks derived from manipulating the haunting tones of early vocal\nmusic — think The Hilliard Ensemble broadcasting from the darkest side of\nPluto! The extreme lengths may turn off some, but for listeners who want to\nhave some very atmospheric music playing while going about their day, while\nsleeping or meditating or hitting the heavy bag, whatever, this is a\nbeautiful and strange trip. There's nothing quite so celestial as choral\nvoices given the full ambient music treatment, and Nox Intempesta make a\ngreat contribution to the genre with this set of recordings.\"\nthegatelessgate.bandcamp.com\nNox Intempesta is the project of myself and Sevenism begun in 2015 on the ambient online forum at  ambientonline.org.\nYou can find other works by Sevenism at\nsevenism.bandcamp.com\nsoundcloud.com/sevenism",

            "about": "The exploration of the Universe has been a great inspiration for electronic music artists from the beginning of the Space-Age into the present. Aural Films is commemorating the 50th Anniversary of the Moon landing with a new on-going series featuring collections by Space Music artists from around the world.\nVolume 5 continues with a collection of music from American Electronic Music artist, Scott Lawlor. Read more about what he has to say about Space and Music in the Questions and Answers below:\nQ. When did you first become interested in Space exploration?\nA. I have always had an interest in space, growing up watching reruns of Star Trek the original series, The outer limits as well as newly aired programs like Project U.F.O and Battle Star Galactica.\nListening to classic albums like Dark Side of the Moon and Saucerful of Secrets were also pivotal moments in the development of my interest in space.\nQ. What interests you most about Space exploration?\nA. The notion that there is other intelligent life out there in the cosmos. I've always thought that with all of this space, we can't be the only life or exist on the only planet capable of supporting sentient life.\nQ. Would you travel to space given the chance?\nA. I can't imagine, for me, being blind, it would do much for me except for the initial acceleration.\nQ. How are ideas from Space exploration used in your work?\nA. Since a lot of my work has a cosmic sound or rather evokes imagery of the vastness of the universe, I find much inspiration from either the planets or specific events related to the phenomenon of outer space.\nQ. What are your favorite instruments for making Space music?\nA. Mostly my Roland fa08 and some reverb plugins, once in a while samples of the sounds of space as recorded by the PWS plasma wave instrument and more recently, Zanaptic wormhole.\nQ. Is there any relationship between Space exploration and electronic music?\nA. The vast soundscapes, low frequencies and extended times of space music lend themselves to imagining what it could be like to go to outer space, fly between stars and visit other worlds.\nQ. How is Space music different from popular styles of music?\nA. Besides the extended play of most space music as noted in the previous question, there is no set form to this sort of music as there is in popular styles where a specific formula is usually followed.\nThough I've never seen the stars or planets, I imagine a certain formlessness to it all, still organized loosely but with an element of random chaos.\nSpace music doesn't have a set form and when listening to it, you're invited on a journey to join your imagination of that of the artist who produced the sound you're hearing.",

            "about": "\"The Hail Mary as a prayer has been stable from the early Church since the first half of it comes straight from Scripture—the Annunciation and Mary’s visit to Elizabeth. The Church added the words Mary and Jesus to the Hail Mary in the 1200s. In the 1300s, when the Black Death swept Europe, the second part—Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us now and at the hour of our death—was added and spread. In the 1500s the Church codified the prayers of the rosary, and the additions became standard.\nThe Our Father comes straight from Scripture. This prayer contains Jesus’ instructions on how to pray to the Father.\nThe Glory Be to the Father was an ancient prayer said at the end of each Psalm as the monks read through them.\nThe Fatima Prayer was added between each decade in 1930, officially, as Mary had requested during her appearance at Fatima in 1917. It is optional.\nApostles Creed. The form we use dates back to the 400s.\nNOTE: St. Louis de Montfort is credited with adding the set of prayers that introduce the main part of the rosary: Apostles Creed, 1 Our Father, 3 Hail Mary’s, and the Glory Be.\nHail, Holy Queen (Salve Regina) was composed in the eleventh century and added as the prayer on the rosary’s centerpiece.\"\nI created this 3 and a half hour dark ambient track in January of 2025 from various shortwave radio broadcasts of the Rosary in Latin from Vatican Radio which were run through a multitude of effects such as molecular, replica XT, reaktor, Freak and Guitar Rig 7.",

            "about": "Review by Steve Sheppard: One World Music Radio\"\n\"On this glorious sunny day my thoughts are pulled back to the autumn of 1970, we gathered with expectation in the school yard to swap albums as a damp morning dew hung over the playing fields with an air of chilling expectancy, Pink Floyd had released a new album and everyone wanted it and couldn’t wait to hear it, much was the way in this decade of opulence within music, this was the beginning of the reign of the grand king, progressive rock.\nTo this day I remember thinking to myself, why is there a cow on the cover of that album, but the music just blew everyone serious about rock music away, being a major Emerson, Lake and Palmer fan this would be the same in my case, and just as in the October of 1970 and the arrival of the album, much is the now the same some 49 years later, as I gaze out of my studio window, I watch the day come alive, and I’m listening to Scott Lawlor’s very own twist on the masterpiece of Atom Heart Mother.\nLawlor has got it beautifully perfect; creating an album based on someone else’s work is not about copying it verbatim, it’s about manifesting something real, true to its source, but allowing your own expressions about the music to come forward to the listener, and that is exactly what the artist has done here. All the little nuances are here, the Tabla effects, the synths, the progressive based percussion and that every so addictive Floyd styled ethic, that use to take us eager listeners back in the day, on a journey without even knowing where we were going or, if we were even going to come back. Such were the days of Progressive Rock, it was a major sea change in music, a crossover from classical to rock and it mixed perfectly for some of us.\nThe mood and progression of Lawlor’s version is extremely listenable and I am pretty sure that most Pink Floyd fans I know, and that’s quite a few, will like what he has done here. For me listening to the organ and all those subtle little chord changes, the smoothness and transition of the overall composition is very well done indeed, for me I could easily be back in the early 70’s and realising I need to add Foxtrot by Genesis, or Trilogy by ELP to the arm of my record player.\nThe other thing about this album is that it is so well done that I just drifted off in a purple haze (Wait that’s another artist) and 20 minutes had passed before I even started to write this review, as I draw to my conclusion Lawlor’s offering has just finished, and never has three quarters of an hour been that enjoyable for absolutely ages.\nI would imagine that Scott Lawlor would have loved to have gone to Abbey Road where the original album was created, but nearly 50 years later he has produced something not just worthwhile, but an album that is accessible to all fans of prog rock and electronic music, and done so in a way that honours the original album, with an inspiring twist of genius along the way, thoroughly recommended indeed.\"",

            "about": "This is my third solo piano album and all the tracks were improvised in January of 2017.\nAlbum and song titles inspired by, and in some cases, submitted to the naviar haiku project ( naviarhaikus 102, 121, 113, 146, 147, 157, 079 AND 072 Respectively)\nwww.naviarrecords.com\n\"I listened to this album twice today, it served as the background to my planning of a big work-related project. And then as the soundtrack of my break and what you can name a silent focus meditation/daydreaming.\nI can personally testify that this is right up my alley of favorite music; stupendous throbbing chords meet dense and dramatic, sometimes melodramatic, passages through one's emotional cogwheels and dreamtime generators. The stuff dreams are made of, in other words.\nI loved all the tracks, without discrimination. If, However, I were to choose, i'd say that Over the scattered starlight and In the clear night were my favorites.\nThough, to say it out loud, i'd give everything a bold 5/5. Definitely an album which I can entitle as a masterpiece. It's that beautiful, mysterious and stimulating/engaging. It reads through like some unfathomable haiku that I personally don't ever want to understand, just swim within and in-between its shores.\"\nReview and artwork by Wings of an Angel\nwingsofanangel.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "These 12 tracks, mostly improvised but a couple were planned over several days, were inspired by Rev. Kimberly Braun's Advent meditation series given in 2022 and were written between November 29th and December 21st as a response to various meditations and reflections given throughout the series.\n\"What is awakening? And what is stillness?\nI find, as you probably have, that the answers have a similar foundation and end point, while simultaneously hosting a full range of different pathways and experiences.\nIt is like a valley being filled with wildflowers. All of them have roots that reach into the soil, all of them flourish when there is a balance of water and sun, all of them do well if the temperature is conducive to their survival.\"\nAwaken to the Invitation of Grace was inspired by Words of Rilke and John Donahue\nLate have I Loved You was inspired by text from the Confessions by St. Augustine\nWaiting for Redemption was inspired by text from the book of (Luke 2:36-38)\nFinding Rest was inspired by text from the book of Matthew 28:11\nI have Come to bring a Sword was inspired by text from the book of Matthew 10\nBlessed Am I Who Mourn was inspired by text from the book of Matthew 5:20\nWound Becomes Portal was inspired by text from the Radiont Sutra by Lorin Roche\nGrace Illumine was inspired by text from the book of Luke 1:26-28\nSoul Magnify was inspired by text from the book of Luke 1:41-48\nVulnerability of the Heart was inspired by text from the book of John 14: 1-2\nThe Door to Communion was inspired by text from the book of Luke 11: 1-4\nAwakening Anew was inspired by text from the book of Matthew 9:15-17",

            "about": "This album (almost a year and a half in the making, since the summer of 2018), was inspired by incidents of severe child abuse which there, sadly, is no shortage of accounting of on the internet.\nEvery parent has moments when frustration overrides a typical response to a stressful situation, particularly in cases of difficulty toilet training and, in particular, when that child arrives at managing this behavior later than what is considered to be the norm.\nstudies and incident reports show that problems of this type are one of the main catalysts for severe abuse which culminates either in death or permanent disfiguration of a child who does not know any better about what he is doing or not doing right to please his parents.\nThis album takes the listener into the mind of a teenager who is haunted by the memories of a horrible night when he was severely disfigured after being thrown into a bathtub of scalding water as a result of the unimaginable rage of his father who was subsequently imprisoned for his actions.\nEach composition is a sonic snapshot of a moment in time whether past or present and how he copes with the lifelong scars and haunting memories of the horrific events he endured which would ultimately change his life forever.\nThe pain of memory starts out with the protagonist being pretty carefree as you can hear from the sound of a child laughing in the background, it's a memory of a happier time but the music is a bit haunting and melancholy, foreshadowing what is to come in terms of fragments of trauma remembered throughout.\nThe regression room is a bit creepy, intended to symbolize a clinical setting of detached professional therapists trying to cure the patient by bringing him back to a much earlier time to deal with the aftermath of the traumatic abuse. I felt a music box sound would engender the association of regression, though it morphs into drones and the sound of children playing but it's as if the environment is being observed secondhand from within the mind of the protagonist.\nBoiling Rage is pretty self-explanatory, a flashback to the event which changed his life forever. I took a field recording of my daughter playing and laughing in the bath tub and transformed it into the menacing shrieks you hear throughout the piece.\nBad seed is an intense journey into the mind of the character in the narrative, the unrelenting guilt of what if's, mourning the loss of innocence, continuous self-persecution, feeling that if he had just behaved better, none of this would have happened.\nAs you probably know about severe abuse, most children who are very young feel they are at fault for the horrible and unjust punishments that befall them.\nThe relentless cacophony of such patterns of thought entwine themselves in a vicious circle of self-doubt and self-hatred that lead back to an endless loop. I hope I captured the essence of such mental phenomena in this track.\nBleeding Soul is yet another snapshot of mournful regret and abandonment, trust and dependence on his father have been completely obliterated, never to return. Again, I took my daughter's laughter and mutated it into the haunting vocalizations you hear in the piece.\nHaunted memories is the final glimpse into the past but from a distance as he has finally begun the slow process of healing, a process which moves along in the final track, Healing Scars, as he has found someone who has also been scarred to bond with, though this other person acts as more of a protector to help him to adjust to his new reality.\n\"This new release by Scott Lawlor maybe the darkest he has ever manifested, and deals with a subject that as far as I can remember, may have never been done before, to create an album to deal with the emotions, occurrences and feelings from a unique perspective about child abuse.\nThis seven piece suite starts with the opener The Pain of Memory; the perspective here is deceptive to say the least, we hear a child's laughter while Lawlor performs a gentle, almost childlike energy on the keyboards, but there is a deeper sense within the weave of this offering that needs to be looked into, as hiding in the shadows of this track is something so dark, so terrifying you may just miss it, listen carefully to this piece and feel the intensity and apprehension of what is to come.\nThis is one of the most impressionist albums I have ever heard from the artist, but he is in a fine creative flow currently. The second labyrinth on the album has been reached, and upon the frame of the doorway is the title marked The Regression Room. Without doubt an eerie sense of foreboding can be found here, one that wouldn't go amiss in a Tim Burton movie. The sterile environment of a mind yet to be bent to a will unknown is laid here brick by brick, and one can feel the child like innocence and a creeping movement of unreality forming all around.\nBoiling Rage, a track that is self-explanatory perhaps, here Lawlor brings us a menacing backdrop of ambient tone, it is a kin to a Crow landing upon a carcass seconds before commencing its feeding frenzy, but on the cruel winds of this quite powerful piece, is one of the best performances on keyboards and\nsynths I have heard from the artist, as he draws us a compelling, a riveting and an utterly alarming musical narrative; the cleverness of a hovering anticipation of utter fear is felt here like never before.\nThe title track is behind our next dusty door, Bad Seed is before you, imagine being told you were the sum of all evil, a worthless cocoon of skin wrapped around a pointless skeleton, from abuse comes guilt, from guilt comes, the constant reality of bargaining with a higher power, the result of self-blame and laying in the basement of utter self-loathing is a true Bad Seed. Lawlor's talents excel here in manifesting a world free from the one thing we all crave, hope.\nWe now move to my personal favourite room within this dark dimension, it is entitled The Bleeding Soul; from the energetic refrains of this track, it peeks in through the tattered remnants of my palace of pain, my cathedral of ugly memories. Lawlor's skill at creating a hidden dimension of mournful abandonment is breath-taking, his manifestation of these hallways of despair is literally mind blowing, the organ sound here is one that I love, but one I fear the most, as it is the creator of musical shadows of nothingness.\nThere is within this realm of mists a way out, a way past the deceptions of pains rich tapestry of lies, a doorway to another reality free from its clutches, and now if we cross this next threshold we will find this very emergence of a possible sanctuary, one that is entitled Haunted Memories. Time is the saviour, and from what was once a razor cut so excruciatingly tender, after a while it becomes part of a tale of past hurts and sufferings, but growing within is a slow, but ever onward intention, a curative essence of recuperation. Lawlor draws us a misty image of the vagueness of hope with his synths, and does it in a way that even the most hardened of us can feel the possibilities of an opportunity to rebuild, slowly begin to grow once more.\nThe last room to visit before we vacate this land of dark musical mists is entitled Healing Scars; this is a magnificent composition, one that contains a wonderful sense of arrangement, the string like sounds and the choral effects are transcendent and draw a final line in the sand for our protagonist, after all he has survived and finally won the day. The sense of craft here by Lawlor to leave the album like this is well noted, and much respect has to be given.\nBad Seed by Scott Lawlor is without doubt one of the most dark and heart rendering albums I have had to review, it took me back to a few hallowed halls of hell myself, but through music we all heal, through the splendid ability to be creative, this gives us a sense of precious hope, and Scott Lawlor has done just that by producing one of the most poignant albums this year with ease, an album narrated with tone, a dark sense of ambience and an inspired sense of genius that go into illustrating perfectly, the suffering of an innocent, and the eventual long road out of nowhere, an exceptional release indeed.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio",

These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nThis work explores the raw unbridled passion of the art of the spanking from the submissives perspective.",

I left an open microphone on to capture the ambience of the room as if I were recording a live performance as, indeed, I was since all tracks were improvisations with no overdubs. The\nonly post processing was the addition of some reverb. I hope you enjoy this final installation of the trilogy.\nYou can find volume 1 here:\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/bells-for-an-imaginary-audience\nYou can find volume 2 here:\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/bells-for-an-imaginary-audience-volume-2",

It is an album that blurs the boundaries between fear and fascination, between light and shadow.\nIt is like a descent into a subterranean world that is never quite tangible because, while it sings its dark song, it is still shaping a new, alien landscape under heat and pressure.",

            "about": "this album was originally released on the weareallghosts label and is my interpretation of the legend that Jesus descended into hell during his burial after the crucifixion.\n5 years later, I decided to add some additional material to the album and change the order of the tracks to create a narrative that is more cohesive regarding these events.\n\"In truth – one thing is certain: there exists a night into whose solitude no voice reaches; there is a door through which we can only walk alone – the door of death. In the last analysis all the fear in the world is fear of this loneliness. From this point of view, it is possible to understand why the Old Testament has only one word for hell and death, the word sheol; it regards them as ultimately identical. Death is absolute loneliness. But the loneliness into which love can no longer advance is – hell.\nThis brings us back to our starting point, the article of the Creed that speaks of the descent into hell. This article thus asserts that Christ strode through the gate of our final loneliness, that in his Passion he went down into the abyss of our abandonment. Where no voice can reach us any longer, there is he. Hell is thereby overcome, or, to be more accurate, death, which was previously hell, is hell no longer. [Emphasis added] Neither is the same any longer because there is life in the midst of death, because love dwells in it. Now only deliberate self-enclosure is hell or, as the Bible calls it, the second death (Rev 20:14, for example). But death is no longer the path into icy solitude; the gates of sheol have been opened. From this angle, I think, one can understand the images – which at first sight look so mythological – of the Fathers, who speak of fetching up the dead, of the opening of the gates. The apparently mythical passage in St. Matthew’s Gospel becomes comprehensible, too, the passage that says that at the death of Jesus tombs opened and the bodies of the saints were raised (Mt 27:52). The door of death stands open since life – love – has dwelt in death.\" (p. 301\nIntroduction to Christianity - Joseph Ratzinger (1968)",

            "about": "The end has come, the end is here, the end is now, the end is near! Sheesh! The year of 2015 is over. And what a rollercoaster ride it has been! This year will be remembered first and foremost as the year when terrorism – and especially Islamic terrorism – has shown its full- blown ugly head. This album is subsequently titled BOKO HARAM. What the hell is Boko Haram, you may ask?\nIt is a terrorist organization subtitled as Group of the People of Sunnah for Preaching and Jihad and is based in Nigeria of all places. The name \"Boko Haram\" can be literally translated as \"Western education is forbidden\". As its core, Boko Haram was founded as a Sunni Islamic fundamentalist sect, influenced by the Wahhabi movement, advocating a strict form of Sharia law. And as you know from life experience – strict means trouble is around the corner…\nLet us elaborate: For those of you who have been asleep for the greatest part of 2015, here's a newsflash: THE WORLD IS AMIDST A CULTURAL WAR; a die-hard clash of civilizations. Now, we have nothing against the great Arabic civilizations of the past, having studied history very well and being avid intellectuals of sincere valor. But, what is happening right now in the world has nothing to do with civil law or civilized behavior. Unfortunately, in the last dozen of years, and especially since the infamous so-called \"Arab Spring\" and collapse of nations one after another, the lack of steady pillars in the Arab world has shown its nature and has taken its toll. Instead of choosing and following humanistic values, they have chosen the method of practical Jihad, which inter alia, is a sign of decadence and degeneration.\nMany nations engage in warfare for resources – there's nothing new about that. Very few, however, go as far as destroying its own resources (physical, cultural, intellectual et al.) and people with such fierce brutality and inhuman cruelty. It is the embodiment of nihilism. Say what you will, but except very few countries in the Gulf (which produce nothing and rely solely on western technology, research and knowledge) – all countries in the Arab world have been literally a hell on earth for their inhabitants, starting with weakest (women, children, the elderly etc'). No place in the Arab world succeeded in the last hundreds of years to become a haven or a safe place; not to mention the weakening of intellectual strength and null investment in human capital; all the while corruption (moral, civil, pseudointellectual etc') has been the king and prince of these nations.\nMany countries have problems and it's easier to speak of foreign affairs than to look inward; believe us, we're not denying the problems of our own places of residence, but while our countries have succeeded in producing an amazing array of cultural and societal accomplishments and are considered more or less safe and flourishing – they Arab world at large, with their societies in particular, are busy fighting between themselves and blaming the whole world for it – U.S., Israel, Europe et al.\nWhile it's true that nobody is innocent and dirty politics is unfortunately everywhere – the behavior the adherents of these ideologies execute against their own and all others in the world are a historic stain and grave sin that nobody else is responsible for. Instead of looking deeper within themselves and fixing little by little the roots that have stirred the extremism within themselves – they keep on removing any sign of civilized patterns from their actions towards others.\nWithout getting into religion as I am an Atheist and Scott is a Deist, we both have the utmost respect for other cultures, recognizing and accepting the benefits of each to human evolution – we see how folly interpretations of manmade texts that don't get contradicted immediately – turn into deadly ideologies. To us, there's no such thing as a divine religion; all are human religions in the sense they go through vigorous hermeneutics and either evolve or devolve.\nIt is sad for us to say this out loud but \"the religion of peace\" is at the present moment everything but peaceful. It is the source of tragedy, misery and horrendous crimes against humanity; all being conducted and executed in its name, without much echo within the Muslim world. This hypocritical silence of the so-called intellectuals, Sufis and all others who have a voice but choose silence over the naked truth – is the stark Achilles' heel of any possible evolution onward.\nRemember that history remembers all; one day when the Yezidis ye have murdered by the thousands, the Kurds, the Jews and all else will perhaps be in power over you – they will all remember your silence of the lambs and make their judgements accordingly.\nJust as the Jews, Gypsies and many others will never forget the Holocaust and the deadly silence of the Germans and their allies; in this very way, your surviving victims will never forget and forgive the Arab and Muslim world for their silence and for turning their backs. History loves its justice served in due time.\nThis album with its slightly brutal atmospheric drones reflects these thoughts and emotions in three parts: The journey starts with Junk Yard Testosterone – a metaphor for manpower which instead of nurturing and nourishing has become a serial killer type of power. Men are the main warriors of Jihad \"thanks to whom\" countries such as Yemen, Lybia, Syria, Iraq etc' have become a mass graveyard and site of cultural and spiritual extinction. Similarly to the Ice Age, these men, by their own will and choice, are bringing disaster into the lives of their surroundings. Evolution wise, this kind of Testosterone is best to be found at a junk yard. That's where it belongs.\nThe second part of the journey is a very harsh and foreboding drone: Post-Traumatic Fun. The title is suggestive of the subversive sick humor Jihadi organization find in showcasing gory deaths and executions of innocent helpless human beings.\nThe third part of the journey, one which we both consider to be the magnum opus of the album: In This No Man's Land, You Blow Yourself Up To Avoid Coming Back To Your Blow Up Doll At Home, is a track in two parts, the first depicting the sudden shock of so many terror attacks in such a short span of time, and the second half is more melancholic, depicting the internal and external grief of members of our world who wonder \"what has happened that we have come to this?\" The title suggests a lack of responsibility of the terrorists for their barbaric ways, they would rather blow themselves up, rape women, pillage and burn away any meaningful societal constructs than to return to their homes of self-examination and reflection which could lead to a change of direction: towards civilization.\nAll the while Western civilization is responsible for hundreds of years of successful innovations, technological developmental, an unprecedented richness of intellectual pursuits (from classical music to poetry and visual art, ballet, theater, medicine, academies etc') – what has the Arab and Muslim world contributed in recent decades to the human enterprise but wars, immigration, victimization, spiritual and cultural poverty and the list goes on?\nIf you answer these questions frankly and remain sincere, you will perhaps be able to contribute to finding a solution, because this has been written with humane compassion in order to promote finding integral solutions to a problem that is beyond being solely tribal – it is global and threatening the whole wide world which we humans temporarily inhabit.",

            "about": "You've been away from home for a long long time, working on the orbiting space station, making repairs and installing new equipment. Your family understands your dedication and that you've got to be away from home for months at a time. You hear the news crackling over the radio about the pandemic that has begun ravaging your home world over the last few months. Every week, the effects of the new virus, actually, perhaps it's a very old virus, multiply exponentially, leaving thousands dead.\nEconomies have shut down, people hide away in their homes driven by fear and anxiety but the virus will get them too as it mutates again and again, each strain many times deadlier than the last.\nYou're the last one to leave the station and as you travel towards home, feeling a sense of anxiety but also hope for the future, for plagues have hit your world before, you're looking forward to a long awaited reunion with your loved ones, ever optimistic that they have not yet succumbed to the virus that has killed so many in its brutal wake.\nYou hear a communication over the radio as your ship approaches home that says not to land and you think, it has to be a dream. You call for confirmation but hear no response, just a looping distress call instructing you not to approach the planet.\nQuarantined in space, unable to have the reunion for which you have been awaiting for so long, you remember events from the past: birthday celebrations with your children, playing in the park, family holidays. These memories are all you have left as you disobey the call and land to find a world devoid of human life. The virus has killed everyone, now they are gone and you will never know what the future with your loved ones could have been.\nA last message echoes in your mind as you do what you know needs to be done: \"But Everybody's gone, so I will never know.\"\nReview from the Dungeon in Deep Space\nthedungeonindeepspace.com/2020/06/05/scott-lawlors-conceptual-dark-ambient-thriller-but-everybodys-gone-so-i-will-never-know-is-not-far-from-becoming-reality/\n\"Life does indeed throw up some strange coincidences, when I was a teenage lad I wrote a short story based on a man who had been in a submarine for months\nworking, he had heard turmoil going on above over the radio chatter, and when he eventually rose to take a look he would find that a pandemic of a truly\nevil nature had wiped out the entire human race, leaving him as the last man on Earth.\nFlip that in the aspect that this Scott Lawlor album is similar in content, but from outer space, then you have a journey that were all partially involved\nin right now with the album But Everybody's Gone, So I Will Never Know, except in the case of this story and mine from yesteryear, the virus keeps mutating\nuntil it destroys all life on the planet. We all of course hope that never happens in our world, but this album is a very graphic voyage of a man stuck\nin orbit trying to get home, and listening to the airwaves as they tell tales of utter desolation and distress from below.\nFrom the very first track to the last Lawlor has created a true masterpiece of an album, I have got used to this constant flow of genius from the artist,\nbut here on this work he very cleverly combines, suspense, fear, hope, and desperation into each and every piece.\nPandemic Unfolding begins the journey and relays a constant narrative of media chatter and sounds coming across the coms system; something we have all\nexperienced lately, we’re locked in our homes and still the news comes thick and fast and the deaths pile up on our screens.\nDeparture from Space Station Omega is artistically manifested with an extra sense of urgency written into the weave, through Lawlor’s synths and keyboards\none can really feel the astronaut’s agitation and eagerness to do something, the piece is incredibly intense and readies us for the next offering entitled\nShelter in Place, a calmer composition that continues this dramatic musical narrative, a slow but defined sense of movement can be found here as we drift\nonward.\nThe longest piece off the release is entitled Quarantined in Space. Imagine, you are locked away, safe, but alone, secure, but you have that feeling of\ndread and a very tangible fear about your own love ones, are they alive, have they survived, or, have they succumbed. The piece gets even deeper at around\nthe half way marker, voice and com chatter and sounds of suffering break into the system, and the sheer tension of this piece and growing apprehension\nof the entire album is absolutely palpable.\nA couple of months ago this happened in reality to our planet, World Closing Down, the pandemic which has ravaged our life, began to close its fingers\naround our global throat, strangling the economies of even the largest nations and the streets emptied, humanity had been humbled. Here Lawlor portrays\nthat with such a clever artistic endeavour and such a deadly hand upon the keyboards, one can feel and hear the energies of a population now totally lost\nwithin the refrains of this piece.\nAs you can imagine it was too much for our man and he made a decision that would be against his orders, but did that even matter now? Approaching a Condemned\nWorld explains a narrative of frustration, he now knows he has condemned himself to death, but the drive to find out all that he can is now far stronger\nthan any survival instinct he has, and through Lawlor’s chilling content the small craft moves closer to a devastated home world.\nFrom this point, our penultimate track off the album, we can now view the utter breakdown of society and the carnage of a world of ghosts before us, within\nthe offering But Everybody's Gone, So I Will Never Know. This dream like interpretation quickly manifests energies of nightmare proportions, the end is\nno longer near, the end is here, the final cogs and wheels of life are slowing down, the world has moved on, and into the loving arms of a global entropy,\nand through the medium of the last composition Empty World, we are left with one final visual, decay has replaced despair, hope has been replaced by emptiness,\nwe are now for a last few moments looking upon an barren landscape, and into the very heart of the never ending void itself. Lawlor’s piano here was so\npoignant and played with such a tenderness of spirit.\nI’m not sure how many times I have said this, but each time I do so, I truly mean it, but I believe that But Everybody's Gone, So I Will Never Know in\nmy view is Lawlor’s best work so far. Lawlor has brought into this reality an album that tells a story of something we are all currently living through\nright now, a terrible pandemic, obviously what we all hope for and what seems to be the case, is that the end game of our nightmare does not follow the\nsame line of narrative as Lawlor’s terrifying tale. However this is one magnificent offering, the artist has stood back, changed the perspective of the\ncurrent global pandemic, and come up with an album that is so addictive to listen to, so hauntingly real, and so truly disturbing, perhaps it is true that\nScott Lawlor is fast becoming the Stephen King of Dark Ambient music.\"\nSteve Sheppard: One World Music Radio",

            "about": "This album was originally released on the Slithering Black Records label in October of 2023 so if you purchased it from there, no need to get it again.\nHere's what Anthony had to say:\n\"Call Unto the Stars is a sonic odyssey that unfolds against the backdrop of an infinite cosmic canvas. With each track, Lawlor weaves a narrative that beckons you to gaze upward and connect with the cosmos on a profound level. The album is an invitation to explore the darkest corners of the universe, the secrets hidden among the stars, and the boundless expanse of the night sky.\"\nfor those interested in the geeky technical information, here are the instruments used on each track:\nReaktor for Through Light and Volatile Stardust and the title track, Haunted spaces for I am Daughter of stars and the fires of night, and for Traceable to Stars, bioscape and dronar master edition.",

            "about": "These 10 tracks were improvised between April 14 and July 24, 2024\n\"How good it is to center down!\nTo sit quietly and see one’s self pass by!\nThe streets of our minds seethe with endless traffic;\nOur spirits resound with clashings, with noisy silences,\nWhile something deep within hungers and thirsts for the still\nmoment and the resting lull.…\nThe questions persist: what are we doing with our lives?—\nwhat are the motives that order our days?\nWhat is the end of our doings? Where are we trying to go?…\nOver and over the questions beat in upon the waiting moment.\nAs we listen, floating up through all the jangling echoes\nof our turbulence, there is a sound of another kind—\nA deeper note which only the stillness of the heart\nmakes clear.\nIt moves directly to the core of our being. Our questions are\nanswered,\nOur spirits refreshed, and we move back into the traffic of\nour daily round\nWith the peace of the Eternal in our step.\nHow good it is to center down!\"\nHoward Thurman (1899–1981)",

            "about": "The inspiration for this concept album is quite dark and disturbing inspired by the 1992 film of the same name which you can read about here.\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_Rage\nIf you put the phrase into google, you can even find the movie which is recommended watching to further get a sense of what I hope to convey with the 7 tracks on this album.\nThis film invaded my psyche for weeks, even haunting my dreams and it was at that point that I felt that I had to create my own interpretation of the movie.\nat first, I was going to go for the noise approach but after some attempts, I didn't feel that it worked out so well so I scrapped what I had done and went back to the drawing board and came up with the tracks you're about to hear.\nTrack 4 was inspired by the original music composed for the movie by Gerald Gouriet.\nTrack 5 was inspired by the music of Rasalhague, in particular, his Rage inside the Window album.\nmalignantrecs.bandcamp.com/album/rage-inside-the-window\n\"Horror, darkness … and ambient music are more common bedfellows than you might expect. It’s not all Buddhas and flowing streams in this wide-ranging genre. The dark ambient genre is popular, crossing the borders between different scenes like black metal, experimental music and ambient. Scott Lawlor is a prolific ambient artist whose work crosses many borders, sometimes beautiful, sometimes scary, and he is expert in each style. This music was inspired by the film Child of Rage and is at the darkest extreme of Lawlor’s style; it could indeed function as the soundtrack to any high-quality horror flick. “An Evil Shadow Lurking in the Night” combines avant-garde string pads with an aggressively dissonant piano solo. Other tracks roar like a beast in the night, such as “Rage That Can Kill” and “Pain Can Give Access to Evil”, on which Lawlor demonstrates his aptitude for classic cold, metallic dark ambient sounds. But in a final elegant twist, the concluding “Feeling Tears” is glacially beautiful with its melancholy reverbed piano and swelling string pads; one of the best tracks of Lawlor’s career. This is darkly confident music on which the musician shows both his compositional chops and his skills as a sensitive player.\"\nAllister Thompson\nwww.thegatelessgate.net\n\"This album is a superb horror-esque journey to the depths of the psyche.\"\nWings of an Angel\nwingsofanangel.bandcamp.com\n\"the music goes beyond dark and disturbing and is full of beauty; subtle nuances and drama. A superb mix of dark ambient.\"\nGraham McArthur\ngrahammcarthur.bandcamp.com\n\"An ambient musician from Texas sent me this one, which according to the Bandcamp page is one of several. When I mean several, I'm nearly talking Merzbow here. Why he chose Child Of Rage out of his many others, I don't know exactly, but I suppose as it is a bit more horror inspired than his other works (which constitute to around eighty million various pieces of drone and some weird act called Spank Hookers) he thought I would dig it, and indeed I do. Child Of Rage is actually a concept album based on a '92 CBS made for TV movie which is classified as a mystery, seeming like a very psychotic and strange thing for the network to air around this time period. How in the world do you even get ahold of a made for TV movie that goes back to my childhood years in this day and age? I was seven. I guess I'll not answer that question, but it resulted in this artwork and I think that's a good thing.\nAs for the disc, we certainly are offered quite a bit of drone as you might suspect based on the artist's repertoire, but that doesn't say anything about the creep factor of the disc, which certainly isn't wise music to play while you're playing a horror game with a bad soundtrack, or reading some sort of horror novel (with no soundtrack, obviously.) “Dark Repose” uses frighteningly distorted church organs in way that would raise the hair on the back of my neck during certain scenes in a visual novel (this has happened, with equally bone-chilling music) or while going through a certain area of a game in which you can kind of feel the fright of your surroundings. It almost goes from the sound of a church organ to something a bit more unsettling, which really kind of freaked me out. Really, you wrote this for a '92 film? You could have used this on a modern horror film and made a name for yourself in that industry, seriously. Holy shit, this is one of the most bizarrely uncomfortable pieces I've heard in a bit. I'm also reminded a little bit of the original Pennywise theme (now that we have a remake set to arrive next year) which only adds to the fright factor. Same can be said with the follow-up, “Unihabitable Conditions” which makes me wonder why this gentleman isn't composing for the film industry, or at least working with some independent filmmakers. Congratulations, Scott. You know how to scare the bejesus out of people, even with your more drone-influenced cuts.\nImagine you're driving down the road at night while this is playing in your car. You roll up on a dead body in the middle of the road and all of a sudden a sharp effect starts playing from the disc. You'd nearly shit yourself or have a heart attack when you came upon that grisly scene while having this music play in the background. The same can be said of maggot covered roadkill (it doesn't have to be a human body, after all) which will still come off quite frightening when coupled with that sound. Yes, the record comes with it's own jump scares, which isn't something I can say I've ever heard from a horror-influenced ambient before. This thing is legitimately scary and people are going to think they're in a horror movie if you place this in the background. For all you collegiates reading this, (of which there are none) try switching out the party mix with that of Child Of Rage and then walk off into the background. Immediately, you'll freak some people out at the party, especially some of those who are drunk and start a sort of frenzy. Apparently certain sounds cause fright and among normal people who aren't used to this sort of thing, you can make them go pretty nuts. (Just don't do that right now as things are a little fucked up in this country, especially for collegiates who are no doubt playing a soundtrack similar to Child Of Fire in their heads while imagining horrifying scenes from our new president elect.) At the very end of the day, Lawlor proves that he can scare the shit out of me, and in a way that I've never experienced before. I'm not putting on this record EVER while I read anything frightening, as this disc will only add to it. But there are some rather sad moments to the album as well, which I can equate heavily with visual novel soundtracks of course, which contain quite similar music in tone and atmosphere. That being said, it's just as frightening as anything I've heard from the best horror visual novels (there are very few in English, unfortunately) and I'd certainly recommend it to those looking for a good scare.\"\nThe Grim Tower (Of Observation):\nthegrimtower.blogspot.com/2016/11/scott-lawlor-child-of-rage-2016.html\n\"Scott got in contact with me at Sigil Of Brass using the album upload facility on the\nAbout / Contact page.\nIt only took a quick Google search to find his Bandcamp. Scott’s work is a bit of a mystery\nto me – I had not heard of him as a recording artist before he got in contact, so – what can you expect with this album?\n“Child Of Rage” has a brooding malevolence that bubbles under the surface with every keystroke of the piano and with every synthesiser drone. Most people\nassociate ambient music with crystal healing and new-age mumbo-jumbo but Lawlor has produced an ambient album of such magnificently malignant darkness\nthat it would be a suitable sound track to any psychological horror.\nLawlor admits in his Bandcamp blurb that the film stayed with him, haunting his dreams in the wake of watching it.\nThis album, Child of Rage will stay with me for the duration of my waking vigil. At times cinematic, at times spontaneous Child Of Rage is a stand alone\nwork from the film.\nThe final track, Feeling Tears, is almost one of acceptance and healing. It is like the light after the storm. It is the most beautiful track on the album\nand also the most accomplished musically. Lawlor really has his chops together as a composer and as a performer. Feeling Tears is almost closure on the album.\"\nwww.sigilofbrass.com/2016/09/scott-lawlor-child-rage/\n\"I’d not heard of the film that inspired Scott in the creation of Child of Rage, but a few minutes spent searching the web soon showed it to be something\nthat would likely stick with anyone. Unlike a good number of people though, rather than just shrug it off as time passed, Scott created something that\nchannelled his own feelings and ideas, re-framing it with his own take on the subject, and that’s always a very cool thing.\nChild of Rage is a dark ambient album that, to me, evoked a kind of 80s horror aesthetic, so even though I know what inspired it, most of the tracks conjured\nup images from those kinds of films. It makes great use of various tones to create sinister soundscapes that wax and wane, like the light of a full moon\nmight when battling with a heavy fog. Piano notes add melody too, sometimes giving lightness to the mental vistas created, and sometimes adding a hint\nof chaotic madness as well.\nThe first track, An Evil Shadow Lurking in the Night, is one of my favourites and typifies what I mean in the previous paragraph, creating and growing\na swell of subtle threat that taps into that old school horror vibe. Pulsing bass, high tones, and piano notes stretch the soundscape into something in\nwhich you can almost taste the mist and detect the shifting shadow of a silhouette that wasn't there when you last looked. The piano notes turn frenetic\nand discordant later in the track, keeping a rhythm but adding lashings of mad energy to things. The last part of the track holds a high tone, like a hang-man’s\nnoose waiting for a neck to choke, before quietening into a quieter state of menace.\nRage That Can Kill, the third track, is another I wanted to mention specifically. It begins with a pulsing vibrating drone, a bit like the insane idling\na strange kind of hell-machine might make. A resonant tone builds to a fairly steady ‘ahhh’ like sound, a hollowness entering into the mixture shortly\nafter. The crashing of cymbals grabs the attention more tightly, and a high pitched sound pierces the soundscape like a moth being impaled by a pin. This\ntrack gave me the notion of a killer finally getting the victim, the subtle lightness that emerges after the violence of the cymbals seeming to hint at\nthe ‘peace’ the victim might now have. This lightness dimmed or soured a little near the end though, so maybe they didn’t find the peace they were looking\nfor.\nTrack five, Uninhabitable Conditions, is another track with a dark, vibratory opening, but also has a buzzing swarm-like tone. What I most liked about\nthis track was that the whole thing seemed to be underpinned by a relatively fast pulsing effect, every swell of tone or rumble of bass imbued with this\nenergy. It gives the whole track a pace and punchiness that rocks the brain. I enjoyed this immensely.\nThese were the tracks that I wanted to be most detailed about, but the others on Child of Rage all fit and expand on the themes and textures that run throughout.\nI will give a little shout out to Dark Repose for its creepy and warped music-box tones though.\nChild of Rage is an atmospheric and moody album that, if your brain was a nice bowl of cereal, would pour over just the right amount of rich, hair-tangled blood. Not enough to make the cereal too soggy, but enough to make it something that seeps into the mind in a most agreeable way.\"\nCasey Douglass: Dark Music Review\nwww.casey-douglass.com/2017/09/dark-music-review-child-of-rage.html",

            "about": "This album was originally published on The Church of Noisy Goat in July of 2023, so if you purchased it from there, please don't buy it again. I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nThe inspiration for this concept album is quite dark and disturbing inspired by the 1992 film of the same name which you can read about here.\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_of_Rage\nIf you put the phrase into google, you can even find the movie which is recommended watching to further get a sense of what I hope to convey with the tracks on this album.\nThis film invaded my psyche for weeks, even haunting my dreams and it was at that point that I felt that I had to create my own interpretation of the movie.\nAt first, I did a noise reinterpretation of the film but then decided to do an ambient version which I subsequently released in 2016.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/child-of-rage\nThis album is quite popular and has several nice reviews.\nA few months later, I revisited the original noise edition and decided that I liked it so submitted it to a noise label which, around 2019 or so, decided to delete their whole catalogue without giving any of the artists advance notice of this activity so the album was lost forever except in my personal archives. I have remastered it so it sounds louder, more immersive and better than before.",

Someone with chrematistophilia, known as a chrematistophile, becomes sexually aroused if they are either forced to pay for sex or are robbed by a sexual partner. In some cases, chrematistophilia can manifest itself as a desire to be forced to have sex for money.\nThe term chrematistophilia entered the lexicon in the 1980s.",

            "about": "Cold reading is a set of techniques used by mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, mediums and illusionists to imply that the reader knows much more about the person than one actually does.\nThis LP, an emotive collaboration between ambient drone magicians Scott Lawlor & Wings of an Angel, implies the paranormal set of mind on every drift of its warm atmospheric sound. This paradoxical contrast between the sonic warmth and the main theme (a paradox in itself) creates a fascinating landscape for para-psychological experimentation with untamed moods, obscure ideas about our intimately personal human lives and the possibility of a transpersonal meta-reality that is beyond our comprehension. But above all, it is a wild emotional roller-coaster that builds upon the premise of ambient music to touch the soul and pierce through our defense mechanisms.\nMysticism and the preoccupation with esoteric occult practices draw our attention outside of ourselves; in such a way that instead of dealing with one's emotions, existential anxieties and cognitive distortions – one's attention is drawn to metaphysics and thus being filtered by proxy. We present this album as an antithesis, speaking of the importance of dealing directly with one's woes and ills, NOT running away from them to a third party or a spiritual doctrine. Let's assume that if God really exists – mustn't it be discovered via the positive energy within us, that we were born with as a default (almost) effortless potential? Aka love, friendliness, warmth, tenderness etc'? Then, what's the logic behind hardcore ascetic practices and violent acts of so-called faith that many charlatans promote as a way of dealing with life's hardships and stepping towards pseudo-divinity?\nWe call you all to examine your conduct and immunize yourself to techniques that are meant to control you rather than free you. Don't mistake lies for truth. Mentalists, psychics, fortune-tellers, mediums and illusionists HAVE NOTHING to tell you that you didn't know before. It's all a show akin to a human circus; a morbid, dishonorable and shadowy one. A theater of shadows that puts a dark veil on top of you.\nIf you allow yourself to speak about how you feel and process your feelings alone and with your significant other(s) – you will gain a better understanding of yourself and feel more at ease in the world. Violence – intellectual as well as physical – is born in the no man's land of our inner slaughter fields. You know yourself way better than anyone else does; you yourself know what's really best for you.",

            "about": "\"There is a plague that is being called ‘Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD)’, that is decimating the bee population. By the end of bee season last April, the commercial bee population had declined by 44%, as compared with 10%-15% in past years. While nobody claims that there is one singular cause for the loss of so many bees, most scientists and environmentalists believe it is a combination of:\n•\tLoss of habitat, due to a variety of factors including pesticide use, mining and drilling, changing temperatures and weather conditions due to climate change that have restricted the area where bees can survive, as well as eradicated some food sources necessary for survival. Additionally, use of herbicides (weed killer) has reduced the available pollen and nectar bees rely on for pollination.\n•\tA group of chemicals called neonicotinoid pesticides that are proven to harm not only bees, but other insects as well. They accumulate in individual bees and within entire colonies, including the honey that bees feed to infant larvae. Bees that do not die outright, experience sub-lethal systemic effects, development defects, weakness, and loss of orientation. The die-off leaves fewer bees and weaker bees, who must work harder to produce honey in depleted wild habitats. These conditions create the formula for bee colony collapse.\"\njilldennison.com/2017/02/21/a-sticky-wicket-of-a-problem-bees-or-rather-a-lack-of-part-i/\n\"With this album, Scott displays his mastery of the subdued minimal soundscape and paints a masterpiece in deep listening pleasure. Delicate low key nuances slowly weave their subtle way in and out of the gentle, calm almost dark waves of atmospheric sound that soothes the listener transporting them inwards into deep reflective meditation. Meticulously crafted and composed, this brilliant piece of work is without doubt my favourite release from Scott.\"\nGraham McArthur\ngrahammcarthur.bandcamp.com\n\"With this recording Scott Lawlor reaffirms his position as a master of dark ambient music, a genre with a big cult following. On this album his music sits in between the abstract, mystical elements of Steve Roach’s darker work (“Colony Collapse Disorder”) and the chaotic, sinister aspects of Lustmord’s output (“Sub-Lethal Systemic Effects”). Lawlor retains his gift throughout his prolific output for crafting long-form ambient that gets under your skin and truly changes the mood of a room.\"\nThe Gateless Gate\nthegatelessgate.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "This album was originally released in 2013, one of my first works of ambient exploration. My most sincere and humble thanks go to Phillip Wilkerson who originally released this album as a part of the complex silence series. Here are his kind words about the recording.\n\"Another rising star in the netlabel ambient world makes a debut with Complex Silence 36. While it is definitely true that Scott Lawlor is still searching for his musical voice, sometimes hearing a fresh voice serves as creative inspiration for us all.\"\n\"Here we have Lawlor exploring the longform ambient track, stretching his musical legs so to speak for 50+ minutes. The result is a wonderful low-volume excursion through beautiful harmonies, washes of rich ambient color, and a tapestry of quiet and contemplative sighs, both varied and complex. Yet Lawlor doesn't venture too far from classical ambience--it's obvious his respect and reverence for ambient music precedes his attempts at creating it. He has done his ambient homework as a listener.\"\n\"As a musician exploring the classical ambient forms, Lawlor seems quite comfortable letting the music take its own path and tell its own story at its own pace. And although it's still early in Scott's career, it is that trait, perhaps, that makes his beginning attempts worth paying closer attention to. In this track, he lets the music wend its way through his hands to our ears, never imposing too much structure or too many rules or too much intention. Indeed, when writing to me about this piece, Scott called it an improvisation, which immediately interested me in hearing it and making it a part of the CS Series.\"\n\"It's an honor to present (and be present for) a promising foray into the ambient world. Welcome, Scott!\"-- Phillip Wilkerson, 2013",

            "about": "Originally released on the treetrunk label in May of 2013, now remastered with new artwork.\nOriginal notes:\n\"I was listening the other day to a couple of the Constant pieces by Stephen Philips and though I had heard some others in the series by people like Digital Mass, Zieltogend and Phillip Wilkerson, I was intrigued by the simplicity of the pieces and thought I'd try writing one myself.\nIt's only been recently that I've been writing drone music so I started with a single note and then gradually added more until I had what I felt was a nice sounding chord, not exactly a minor or major chord but still something pleasant.\nI added some effects and used paulstretch to help create the feeling I was going for which was something simple that conveyed the purpose of the series, doing more with less.\nI am deeply honored that Thomas has decided to release this track and that I am also among a roster of such artists as those who have inspired me to write a selection for the constant series.\"",

            "about": "Beneath the skin of the world,\nthe molten core whispers.\nShapes dissolve, bubbles of existence rise -\na slow-motion eruption.\nThis is not destruction.\nThis is the seething birth of what comes next.\nTechnical and artistic details:\nScott transformed an eight-hour shortwave radio recording into a correspondingly long track.\nIngrid selected a two-hour sequence and transformed a field recording from a metal factory into a drone-like sound, inserting it into Scott's track at different intervals and with overlays.\nThe crystal harp complements the sound.\nFinally, she added her own vocal improvisation.\nThe result is a fiery, glowing ambient piece that hints at the beauty and healing that can arise under pressure and high heat, also in a figurative sense.\nThese sounds act as a means of erasing troublesome thoughts\nand can put your mind at ease.",

            "about": "This album is an expression of my solidarity in standing with the victims of the horrific attacks in Paris on November 13, 2015, as well as those suffering from atrocities in other regions of the world such as Beirut, Baghdad, and Syria.\nwe need healing, we need light, we need something to break the curse and the vicious circle humanity has fallen unto..\nMusic is a universal language which we can all understand so to that end, I wanted to do my small part in being a contributor along with other people who may be using that same vehicle to express their own voices of solidarity during this most difficult time. Thank you for listening as we come together in a time of grief and darkness to discover that we can be a force of good and light, to lend our own individual voices to the cause of peace and tranquility to a world that, more than ever, is in such desperate need of both.\nTracks 1 2 and 3 were performed on the Blind Flight on  stillstream.com  on November 13th and track 4 was improvised on November 15th. All performances are as they were heard when originally performed including any glitches or imperfections except for Track 3 which was then later remastered with additional reverb and delay by Wings of an Angel who also suggested the question for the title track and subsequently, the album itself.\nPhoto by Wings of an Angel\nwingsofanangel.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Back in the mid 70’s the British Interplanetary Society did a study to design a plausible, unmanned interstellar spacecraft. The idea was that they had\nto use existing or near-future technologies (no flights of fancy, no Star Trek) to build what would ostensibly be a deep-space probe, but the probe had\nto be able to reach its destination within a human lifetime. The target of the probe would be Barnard’s Star in the constellation Ophiuchus. Barnard’s\nStar is only 6 light-years away, and the ship was supposed to make the journey in 50 Earth years. Obviously, the ship never really got built. How can you\nbuild something that uses near-future technologies in its fabrication?\nBut what if it had been? And what if it had been sent on its voyage? What kind of images would it have sent back?",

            "about": "I first heard about the concept of Dark Flow from a sound clip of an NPR program and was immediately inspired to come up with something musical to represent the phenomenon.\nI have always been fascinated and enthralled by all things related to space, particularly the immense vastness of our universe and the possibility that there was something beyond it.\nI started googling for ideas to help with my endeavor to come up with titles for the tracks I had written and after reading the article at  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_flow  and some related posts, I used phrases that caught my attention which I also hope will give the listener a sense of what the tracks convey.\nThis album was originally released on the 45 ECHOES SOUNDS label back in May of 2014.\n45echoes-sounds.blogspot.com/2012/03/releases-catalog.html\nA year later, I released Journey Through the Boötes void on my personal bandcamp site and upon playback of Dark Flow, it occured to me that these two releases belong on the same page, Dark Flow being a Prequel to the Boötes album.\nThis reissue has an extra 76 minute track called \"Gateway to the Void\", a transitional work between both albums.\nI hope you enjoy the journey of discovery as you listen to the music inspired by the Dark Flow.",

An extremely violent film that was an icon in the 80s and continues to be worshiped by current generations has had its musical score reworked in fifteen tracks by this composer who has been highly acclaimed for his solo albums and for his partnerships with other renowned artists released by major labels on Bandcamp.\"\nThis complete edition also includes the full film reinterpretation which was originally published on the m i s t label in early 2024.",

And we welcome his new ambient project to the label! The haiku inspired \"Deepening Winter Night\". Seven lovely synth, piano and string based pieces; deep, some dark, and all somewhat unconventional in scale and construction.\nThis album exemplifies the artist's well honed skill and technique on the piano. Scott traverses the keys and scales with confidence. And the result is sometimes pleasantly surprising, especially on this album. As with all of his albums, the finished project is cohesive, pure and polished. An excellent\nalbum. Enjoy Deepening Winter Night.\"",

            "about": "Mental illnesses and handicaps are all around us. People we live with and share moments with suffer and live with mental issues and afflictions, sometimes unknown. This is an album put together from just a small amount of things that people deal with in their heads on a day to day basis. This is a dark ambient mixture of sound and beat in order to represent the darkness within people and the misunderstood struggle they live with everyday. We thank you for joining us on this trip down into the dark ambience that is within.",

            "about": "The season of Lent: a Christian celebration and time to reflect, to answer the call of personal sacrifice (by either giving something up, or I believe less practiced, doing something\nextra) for a time, in preparation for the ultimate cosmic and spiritual event, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nI am inspired by different religious texts and their associated celebrations given to such days by\npeople of faith and felt compelled to compose 40 tracks over the season of Lent in 2016.\nI am reissuing the collection in 8 volumes to be released over the lent season of 2018, having meticulously remastered every track for more clarity and balance.

In looking back, releasing all of the material in one collection wasn't the best idea and so each volume has 5 tracks which will be a much more manageable way to download and hear the music.\nit is my hope that these soundscapes (both dark and light, gentle, and, at times, harsh) will call you further inward, to reflect on the wonder of the universe and the magnificence that is our lives, living them as we feel we are called to do so, with fullness of expression.\nThere were they in great fear, where no fear was: recorded on March 10, 2016\nSend thee help from the sanctuary was performed on March 11, 2016 live on  stilstream.com\nand cover the ark with the vail was recorded on March 12, 2016\nThey that sow in tears shall reap in joy was performed on March 14, 2016 live on  stilstream.com\nBut this is your hour, and the power of darkness!was recorded on March 15, 2016",

            "about": "The season of Lent: a Christian celebration and time to reflect, to answer the call of personal sacrifice (by either giving something up, or I believe less practiced, doing something\nextra) for a time, in preparation for the ultimate cosmic and spiritual event, the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\nI am inspired by different religious texts and their associated celebrations given to such days by\npeople of faith and felt compelled to compose 40 tracks over the season of Lent in 2016.\nI am reissuing the collection in 8 volumes to be released over the lent season of 2018, having meticulously remastered every track for more clarity and balance. In looking back, releasing all of the material in one collection wasn't the best idea and so each volume has 5 tracks which will be a much more manageable way to download and hear the music.\nit is my hope that these soundscapes (both dark and light, gentle, and, at times, harsh) will call you further inward, to reflect on the wonder of the universe and the magnificence that is our lives, living them as we feel we are called to do so, with fullness of expression.\nthe stars shone in their watches was performed on March 22, 2016 live on  stilstream.com\nunto the sepulchre was recorded on March 23, 2016\nunto the hall of judgment was performed on March 24, 2016 live on  stilstream.com\nand thou hast brought me into the dust of death was recorded on March 25, 2016\nthrough the veil was performed on March 26, 2016 live on  stilstream.com",

            "about": "These 4 tracks were improvised between April 9 and June 6, 2024. The former restricted diamond area in south-western Namibia is shrouded in legends and horror stories. Ghost towns in the desert landscape, such as Kolmanskop, and the long-standing ban on access created a myth around this place, which became famous at the beginning of the 20th century due to its numerous diamond discoveries.\nToday, the abandoned site is slowly sinking completely into the sands of the Namib Desert. In addition to the diamonds, the Namib Desert offers breathtaking natural beauty such as Sossusflei, the highest sand dunes in the world, which glow in fascinating colors depending on the position of the sun.",

            "about": "Within ghost hunting and parapsychology, electronic voice phenomena (EVP) are sounds found on electronic recordings that are interpreted as spirit voices. Parapsychologist Konstantīns Raudive, who popularized the idea in the 1970s, described EVP as typically brief, usually the length of a word or short phrase.[1]\nEnthusiasts consider EVP to be a form of paranormal phenomenon often found in recordings with static or other background noise. Scientists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random sounds as voices in one's own language) and a pseudoscience promulgated by popular culture.\nProsaic explanations for EVP include apophenia (perceiving patterns in random information), equipment artifacts, and hoaxes.",

Abandoning hardware, MD focused exclusively\non a computer-based music creation and a hobby became more serious, when he began to build a collection\nof dedicated software, continuously experimenting with sound and music.\nHis current sound focuses on the deep, dark and long, slowly evolving\ndrones, seasoned with glitch and noise elements.\nHe experiments a lot, so his music evolves all the time.\nSoundcloud:  soundcloud.com/metadronos\nFreesound:  www.freesound.org/people/Trebblofang/\nTwitter: @metadronos\nPhoto by alberto bobbera:\nunsplash.com/photos/black-boombox-radio-on-top-window-EFhMssXvxeU\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voice_phenomenon",

It captivates with its ability to evoke a sense of vulnerability and fragility, leaving listeners immersed in a state of haunting introspection until you draw your last breath...\"",

            "about": "This album was actually started in 2015 when I wrote Dreaming the timeless dream for the compilation \"Legacy and Evolution: A Tribute to Edgar Froese\" which you can find at\nradbob.bandcamp.com\nJump ahead to 2017 when I wrote White moon as a submission to the studio4632 2017 mixed genre sampler which you can find at  studio4632.bandcamp.com/album/studio-4632-2017-mixed-genre-sampler\nI subsequently decided to supplement these two tracks with two more parts to the original Dreaming the Timeless Dream composition and also composed a long-form string piece called Birth of Fluidic space, which was inspired by Birth of Liquid Plejades from Tangerine Dream's 1972 album Zeit.\nThen, in 2018, I wrote the 23 minute track Desert Cloudburst as a tribute to one of my favorite albums by the band, Green Desert.\nIt was at this point that I asked my friend Bill Helms to create the cover for the album which he was happy to do.\nFinally, in August of 2019, I wanted to try my hand at writing more Berlin school music and decided to expand the concept to a triple album by including the tracks Twilight In the Canyons and Midnight in Berlin, which are tributes to the mid 80's period of the bands prolific output. The Inevitable Descent into Entropy, composed in 2019, was inspired by early work from the Atem record which came out in 1973. winter's Horizon on Rubicon Peak, composed in 2019, is a piece inspired by Rubicon from 1975 and Poland from 1984 so this track morphs through a number of themes over it's almost half hour length.\nInvisible Borders within Dark Dreams is another track inspired by mid-70's tangerine dream from albums like Phaedra and Encore.\n\"Many in recent years have manifested tributes to the late great Edgar Froese; his influence on electronic musicians worldwide will never fade, and on this latest offering by Scott Lawlor, you will probably find one of the most comprehensive albums and finest tributes thus far, this is not just an album of superb music this is a veritable journey of dreams past and present.\nThe opening piece is a delight to listen to and called Dreaming the Timeless Dream (Part 1) the soft almost heaven kissed organ creates a musical dimension to cast yourself adrift to and just enjoy, this is that moment when you can totally agree with the title, and allow the senses to meld with the timeless energies created by the artist.\nI listen to this next piece and really enjoyed its bright crisp tones, White Moon is a glorious offering of classic electronic music genius with a sensitive percussive beat, one that has a musical narrative that is as bright as the moon itself, the performance here is energetic, but in a distinctly crafted way, and is one of those pieces that you will find yourself constantly coming back to time and time again.\nWe now found ourselves in another universe completely as we reach one of several long form compositions off the release, this is called Desert Cloudburst; this is one of the finest works of art by Lawlor I have heard for some time. There is a hovering anticipation here that is so compelling, there are few artist’s that can honestly say they have captured the energy of the waste land of a desert so well, but Lawlor now must be named as one of them.\nThis is one of those tracks that are utterly timeless, but at all times does what it says on the can, for me this is ambient music at its very best.\nTwilight in the Canyons is next up, this lush and smooth musical narrative literally picks up on where the preceding track left off, however here we have a more pronounced sense of ambience, there is a deeper more palpable manifestation of depth in this most substantial of pieces, the floating synths are perfection, but added to that the instrumental artistic nuances created by Lawlor on his keyboards, seems to bring into this musical realm an almost anthem like energy to the proceedings. In my view the cleverness of this piece is further enhanced, by the mixture of what is an intense feeling of ambience with the true creation of a dramatic flair as well.\nAs you expect from its title, The Inevitable Descent into Entropy, has a distinct sense of darkness about it, one that is extremely enticing, the ethereal vocalisations are also otherworldly, but the skill of the artist here to literally take us on a slow and inevitable incline towards this entropic destiny, is quite stunning to listen to and be a part of.\nI always adore the opportunity to review a Scott Lawlor album, there is always so much to dive in deep with, on this next arrangement that theme continues. Dreaming the Timeless Dream (Part 2) is the fulcrum of the album, one so beautifully composed and masterfully performed; you really cannot help but be moved by it. There is a sense of an end and a musical interpretation for me, of from that descent and acceptance, a new beginning is slowly forming, indeed, Lawlor has achieved his goal as we continue to dream the timeless dream.\nMidnight in Berlin is our next track; its familiar EM style will be adored by many who loved Tangerine Dream and other such ground breaking electronic music artists. There is a very clever sense of movement built into this composition that I respect, and from the structure of the performance one could easily draw a musical portrayal of the subject matter with great ease.\nWe now find ourselves deep within the weave of the album, and arrive now at a true long form opus entitled Birth of Fluidic Space. For all fellow Star Trek fans, this is a title that you will be most familiar with, as it is the birth place and home of species 8472, but here in this inner dimension, between and betwixt the actual space time continuum itself, we are witness to the manifestation to a whole new musical reality of sorts, and this vast work of art at well over an hour long, will explore the very essence of our location with feelings of awe, trepidation, suspense, dramatic ambience and a slow sense of onward floating movement.\nLawlor’s genius comes to the front here with this utter masterpiece, and I must add, worked perfectly with my current situation. I am alone at home, a distant storm is about to hit, it’s getting darker by the minute, and this constant hovering sense of anticipation and ambience combined in music is simply perfect for the moment.\nInvisible Borders Within Dark Dreams is our opportunity to hear the artist create something of a minimalistic composition on piano to begin with. I have heard Lawlor on piano on a few occasions now and he never ceases to impress me with his crafted and thoughtful approach, the synths soon add to that ambience after a couple of minutes, into this half an hour plus creation.\nI have often thought that Lawlor’s works would be an painters delight to turn into modern art creations, this piece especially so, the narrative here is almost deceptive in its build and anticipation, the flute styled tones take us by the hand and lead us into a world of shade and atmospheric tendencies, one so far removed from any reality we know. The energy and intensity of the track manifests itself into something more at the 9 minute mark, as a pulsating and rhythmic electronic vibration is created, one that changes it’s musical appearance again in and around the 18 minute marker with a somewhat sharper tone, then once more flows into an almost Berlin school style toward the end and at the tracks conclusion.\nOur penultimate offering is the very classy Winter's Horizon on Rubicon Peak; this is a track to literally bury yourself within, one that really reminded me at times of Eno in his early years, with such seminal works as Lizard Point or The Lost Day. The performance on synths here is nothing less than sublimely magical, and the artist’s true creative abilities of being able to paint with sound and tone can be absolutely saluted when arriving at this juncture.\nThe last and final destination is not only the conclusion of the album, but the circle of musical life we have come to know as Dreaming the Timeless Dream (Part 3). This finality brings with it one of the most emotive pieces off the release, but one that in doing so raises the eternal question of life, the universe and everything, as no matter what we endure, we continue to dream the endless dream, a stunningly beautiful end, a track from the far reaches of the galaxy, and a perfect conclusion to what must be Lawlor’s most pivotal and most influential album thus far.\nDreaming the Timeless Dream (a Tribute to Edgar Froese) is the release I believe Lawlor hoped it would be, his best work so far with ease. This is a vast collection of musical art that will become a timeless electronic and ambient benchmark for all to follow. Each and every composition on this release is accessible and completely listenable; at times it is very easy to get completely lost within its genius. If you’re a fan of mood filled and creative electronic and ambient music, this is an album that you must have in your collection at all costs.\"\nSteve Sheppard, One World Music radio",

            "about": "These tracks from 2014 were hand selected from the archives of material I was originally going to release as a part of the continuing Drone Excursion series but I felt they would be better used for drone day 2022. 6 tracks spanning 8 hours of subdued minimal ambience for sleeping, resting, relaxation and perhaps, even deep meditation. Wishing you the best drone day possible and thank you for your continued support of my work in sound and imagination. I appreciate all of you.",

            "about": "Drone Excursion 001 'The Choral Drone' is an intense vocal-orientated piece that reminds me of Gyˆrgy Ligeti's \"Atmospheres\", a piece that is famous for being featured in Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'.\nOn the Wikipedia page for \"Atmospheres\", reference is made to a comment Harold Kaufman made about the piece: \"Ligeti's music collapses foreground and background elements of musical structure into a 'magma of evolving sound'\". I believe this to be also true of the work Lawlor has achieved with drone excursion 001. This Is a rich, intense piece that envelopes the listener with a sense of timelessness and rewards with repeated listens.",

            "about": "“Let no two drones be alike must be Scott's motto....at least thus far. Each drone excursion is markedly different from all others.”\nSo says Brian Bourassa in a comment on Bandcamp. I cannot agree more and with the belated 6th instalment in his drone.excursion series, Scott Lawlor proves, if proof be really needed, this point.\n“Unquiet Spirits Crossing the Rubicon” is a deeply immersive, full-on longform piece; one that paints mind-pictures of wide, desolate spaces interspersed with the Cyclopean architecture of another age.",

            "about": "This, the 8th in the Drone Excursion series, was inspired partly by the Magnificent Void by Steve Roach and was originally a shorter track which appeared on a compilation on the nostress label in early 2014.\nMy friend Travis Butler offered to give some thoughts on the music you are about to hear and I thank him for the kind words about this Drone Excursion.\n\"There is a space within us all that echoes our thoughts, feelings, and is a place that we can look forward to inhabiting, can fill us full of dread, or both. Good drone music lets us accomplish all of the above. If there is any guidance, it is gently done. Scott Lawlor's long form drones are a prime example of how rewarding a slow moving trip into the somewhat strange and unexplored regions of your inner being can be. In this latest installment of the Drone Excursion series, called The Mystic Void, we are invited on a trip into the mysterious, where darkness and light dwell together, creating a feeling of beauty and mysticism. Close your eyes, put on the headphones, relax and let this truly magnificent piece take you on a trip through your mind, on a journey through the dark and into the light. You will be greatly rewarded.\"",

            "about": "In 2013, Scott Lawlor entered the modern ambient scene with a bang. One of his inaugural releases was the wonderful Times Escape, inspired by the sleep experiment music of Robert Rich, and recorded in the late Nineties. While listening to that piece, it is easy to imagine that even time itself could stop and reflect on its own existence.\nWe now come to 2015, and Scott has given us another piece of time. Though more minimal than its earlier cousin, this new work entitled Drone Excursion 009 (Suspension of Time), is no less compelling. With its constant drone, and its slowly, almost indiscernible movement, it is more than possible to imagine that time has become immersed in its own vastness. If time can indulge in some well deserved self-reflection, who are we mere mortals to let our minds get in the way of such transcendence? With Scott's usual brilliant melding of dark and light, this well-crafted entry into his Drone Excursion series is a must for all fans of ambient and drone music.",

            "about": "When I let my mind wander the desert landscapes of my surroundings in the Southwestern US where I live, I think of petrified forests, the painted desert, mirages, ghost towns, elusive and imaginary oases and the malevalent ghosts that haunt the supernatural and fantastical fiction of Ambrose Bierce and Robert E. Howard in their weird tales of the Southwest. It is the eternal sadness of these unquiet spirits that Scott Lawlor evokes and invokes throughout the course of the tenth installment of his Drone Excursion project, entitled \"Into the Mystical Desert.\" While listening to this longform piece, I can slowly feel myself sliding into an alternate dimention where the real and the unreal merge into one, and the minor key drone can lull one into feeling that it may not be a bad idea to quietly lie down and surrender. There is exquisite beauty in this sadness, and it can hypnotize, even with the hint of the unearthly wails of those who are doomed to wander forever.\nScott Lawlor has done it again, and has created a magical landscape through his music. Darken your surroundings, close your eyes, and lean back and let this one envelop you either in headphones, or while centered in front of a good pair of speakers. Your patience will be more than rewarded.\nNotes by Travis butler\nPhoto by Ade Hodges",

            "about": "\"I enjoyed Scott Lawlor's last Floyd sojourn, when we drifted back in time with Atom Heart Mother, now we find ourselves knocking at the door marked mystery and wonder of an album that was called Meddle and look deeper into the mirror of the last track entitled Echoes. I'm not of course comparing the original with this version, that would be both unfair and quite irrelevant, but what we can do is allow ourselves to go with the flow and sift back through our musical hourglass to 1971, perhaps even to the Norwich Lads Club in the April of that year, it's first live performance as a piece.\nGood, you are now in the mood so let's go, you will find we can enjoy the ping of the song that moves us into this opus of prog grandeur. Lawlor has also installed the talents of Alistair Thompson on vocals who sings us back into the days of the Meddle album. I must admit, I have now listened to this release on two occasions and I really adore the work that Lawlor has done on this his second Pink Floyd venture, it reveals a whole new side to his skill set and also shows just how close ambient music and prog rock are in mood and presentation.\nEchoes was the last track off the album Meddle and lasted well over 23 minutes in duration, but here Scott Lawlor has added a whole new layer of brilliance to the release by more than doubling the play time of the composition. This musical aural extravaganza is breathtakingly vast in its construction and the organ work of the artist is amazingly colourful in its progression and presentation, and like Pink Floyd, this version it is like a veritable musical art gallery, one that it would be all too easy to get lost within.\nThe haunting presence that is the genius of Scott Lawlor, really pushes to the fore and demands to be listened to. As we hit the 19 minute mark of the piece, his floating ambient style that we know so well creates a sonic backdrop that seems to manifest an entire new reality of tone and sound. The sound of what appears to be a Rook greets our ears, this corvine chorus is beautifully orchestrated and completely listenable in its context, it simply amazes me that each time I listen, time just seems to slip away and this utterly addictive segment is truly magical, if not deeply disturbing in its underlying construction.\nThis new release Echoes (feat. The Gateless Gate) by Scott Lawlor is a totally respectful creation by the artist, I am more than happy to swim in its river of tone for hours. Taking on a project like this is not an easy thing to do and Lawlor has indeed not only done it justice, he has created something here that he can be extremely proud of, which allows us to follow the instructions of the lyrics as we leave the album\nAnd no-one sings me lullabies\nAnd no-one makes me close my eyes\nSo I throw the windows wide\nAnd call to you across the sky\nI call to you to buy this album; it is outstanding and carefully produced to allow you to not only drift back in time, but to enjoy a whole new vibe whilst doing so.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard of One World Music Radio",

I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nSpank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nElectrophilia is a sexual fetish that revolves around electricity and electrical stimulation. People with electrophilia, known as electrophiles, enjoy fantasizing about or receiving electrical shocks to their body, especially to their genital region, anus, and nipples. Some people believe this paraphilia is more common in females than males.\nElectrophilia is also sometimes known as Electrocutophilia.",

            "about": "My heart grows heavier every day as I hear about more and more tragic events happening, not only in our own country but around the world, Innocent lives lost to different extremists (no matter what the religion is), police brutality, and officers killed in the middle of what people claim are peaceful rallies. Perhaps the rallies start out peaceful but if a life or 20 are lost during such a congregation of individuals, it then becomes an event that is no longer peaceful, no matter how many individuals did not want it to go down that way.\nWhoever kills an officer of the law should be served justice in the swiftest most appropriate means possible and if it is determined by a jury of 12, if it ever gets to court that it should be the death penalty, then so be it.\nTo the police men and women who abuse their power and privilege of serving our great nation, you aren't innocent either but this is nothing new. It only seems so because we have social media, citizen reporters by virtue of cellular technology and an irresponsible media who are very good at playing one side against the other in a never-ending political agenda of divide and conquer which leave the citizens vulnerable to being more and more manipulated because they continually lose trust in authority, after all, remember Rodney King? The media just played the clip of the police officers beating him over and over until it was indelibly etched in the minds of the people that the cops were the bad guys in that situation.\nYou didn't see much about what happened beforehand and it's the same with these other cases where police brutality is involved.\nare there bad cops? Absolutely and they should be tried and reprimanded for brutality that occurs when it does and if someone dies as a result of such brutality, that policeman should also be subject to the same swift justice that I spoke of previously.\nevery life matters, I'll say it again for clarity, Every Life Matters. Not black lives, not LGBT lives, not disabled lives, not Indian, not Asian, but all lives matter and the recent black lives matter movement has resulted in a further fragmentation of a society that was already broken by division driven agendas for a long time.\nIf you are suspected of a crime and told to lay on the ground and you don't and it appears to the officer who suspects you of a criminal activity that you're going for a gun, he's acting on his training to respond to that situation, common sense and logic tell me that.\nIt is not necessary for that same officer who may genuinely be in fear of his life to shoot a suspect multiple times which may result in death of the suspect in question, something else common sense should tell anyone.\nSure, an officer can say that he didn't intend that the suspect die as a result of whatever police brutality was applied but as it has been said by many, \"intentions are not good enough\". If I told the IRS that I intended to pay my taxes but the check got lost in the mail, would I be let off? Certainly not and neither should a police officer be given a slap on the wrist and/or administrative leave with or without pay when a suspect meets his or her demise under the charge of that officer. a death is a death no matter what the intention and if the loss of life is as serious of an issue as some claim in this country, what of the penalties for that loss? Where is the personal responsibility on both sides of the debate?\nI have good and dear friends who are minorities, hell, I'm a minority myself, and I have no reason to not believe these people when they tell me that there are racially motivated incidents that occur to people with such minority statuses by the very people who have sworn to protect them.\nThe day after the shooting of police which resulted in 5 officers losing their lives in Dallas Texas, certain media outlets were silent about the event but those same individuals would be all over the internet with outrage if it was another person killed by a cop. This further reaffirms the sad reality that not all lives matter, only those that fulfill a need to further a specific political anti-cop agenda within certain parts of our society.\nWe live in a hyper reactive hair-trigger society now where there seems to be almost no justification needed for someone to be killed, no matter which side of the law you're on. But if you're a public servant and you have probable cause for arresting someone suspected of a crime, what is your reaction supposed to be when the suspect resists arrest and when you're constantly emendated with rhetoric that says that all cops are bad, all minorities are unjustly sought out to be perpetrators of criminal activity and that only certain lives matter, wouldn't that put you on ultra-high alert and naturally elevate your reactive reflexes?\nWhen you're a cop and you tell someone to lay on the ground, how are you delivering that directive? If it's by way of getting in the face of the suspect and screaming confrontationally, consider how that will lead the suspect to respond for a moment.\nConfrontation breeds conflict and more confrontation, resulting in an endless circle of violence against each other that has almost no hope of being broken.\nPart of the blame for all the violence, disregard for human life and our fractured society lays at the feet of the entertainment industry (particularly Hollywood), all aspects from television and movies to music and video games. Consider the television shows that they make for children these days. How much violence occurs in one episode of some of the more popular shows? Hollywood's flimsy excuse for pedaling such inappropriate media to children is that it sells and therefore there is a demand for the content.\nLook at how many people feel the need to be continuously bombarded by text messaging, email, Facebook twitter, and the like.\nLook at all the road rage around you, people cutting other people off just to gain 10 seconds of time to get where they're going. Multiply that out and you have overwhelming traffic jams which stress people out more and more every day.\nWe have learned to devalue life from the messages of planned parenthood who makes millions a year on abortions. Hollywood makes billions a year making movies that glorify and celebrate violence but do the gun control crowds say \"follow the money\" to those two organizations like they do with the NRA whenever there is a mass shooting?\nMost people don't demonize those two organizations for their cultural role in the rise of perceived meaninglessness of the lives of their fellow man. Look in the phone book and see if there are as many organizations that offer adoption services, rather than abortions for young women who are pregnant. And for the record, I believe abortion is a personal choice and the government should have absolutely no say at all in that nor should they fund organizations that perform such procedures. That should be a choice between the individual and her physician, a comment which is sure to draw criticism from some.\nBut present all the alternatives to someone in that situation, not just the easiest and the one that will make the most money for an organization who has a monetary interest in the woman making the choice that will best serve the financial needs of said organization. If it's okay to kill innocent life then all bets are off on people who piss us off, believe differently than we do, harm someone we love, etc.\nThis, then is my response to a fragmented world, one where people have little trust in authority, one where authority has done little to earn that trust, and one where life itself has value only as a political tool to advance a certain agenda among entrenched corporations and the politicians who allow themselves to be bought and sold by those organizations.\nTrack 1 Performed live June 26, 2016-on  stillstream.fm\ntrack 2 performed live June 25, 2016 on  stillstream.fm\ntrack 3 performed live July 8, 2016 on  stillstream.fm\ntrack 4 performed live July 6, 2016 on  stillstream.fm\nReview by Wings of an Angel\nI will immediately put forward that this is one of the best albums of the year, period. it's an AMAZING soothing record with the strongest piano work I heard in ambient as of late. The strings and pads are so lush I could swear it's an orchestra playing live. AN ABSOLUTELY STUNNING ALBUM. Can't praise it enough.\nwingsofanangel.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Eloheh is a word from the Cherokee language. Everything is connected, dependent on each other, needs each other to work as a whole.\nThe following quote explains what motivated us to make this album.\n\"Randy Woodley and his wife Edith have a word for this harmony found in creation: In the Cherokee language, this concept of well-being is often called Eloheh (pronounced ay-luh-HAY).\nThe Cherokee meaning of well-being is deep and resonant and is difficult to translate into English. Eloheh does mean “well-being,” but it means so much more. Eloheh - what some traditions call the way of harmony - describes a state of being in which everything is as it should be or as it was created to be. Eloheh means that people live in peace, not war; that the earth is cared for and produces in abundance so that no one goes hungry.\nEloheh means that people treat each other fairly and that no one remains a stranger for any length of time.\"",

            "about": "For decades, we have been witness to the sad erosion of our society because digital technology has taken the place of the natural and necessary activity of face-to-face communication. It began with texting, moved to social media, and finally, the visual emoji is quickly replacing the English language with pictorial representations of our thoughts and feelings which used to be conveyed by letters and numbers.\nThese days, people gather together in restaurants, spaces of nature and other social venues only to have their phones with them so they can avoid looking at and interacting with each other and instead, become immersed in the screen that blocks their visual field from the people around them.\nThey get into car accidents, walk into buildings or other people, all because they are enamored with the screen on the device which they will be compelled to replace just as quickly as the one they purchased previously.\nThe technology that started out being a mere convenience for most of us, has morphed into a digital drug to which we have become numbingly addicted.\nAdd to that the notion that besides being compelled to remain in a digital bubble of one's own making, there is a collectivist mentality by those who design and distribute the technology which demands that you follow the groupthink of the day, lest you be cast out and summarily deleted from the digital landscape.\nThis album then, has a tongue in cheek title demonstrating the concept that the digital presence you designed for yourself over time, will eventually delete you from reality.\nSo before that happens, protect yourself by stepping away from the electronic device that seems to have a hold on you, go for a hike in the woods, have a real and intimate conversation with someone at a restaurant, but don't get so disconnected that you forget to support me by providing me with some digital currency for a digital product that is making fun of the digital world which we are all a part of.",

            "about": "Exoplanetary shuttle missions have been in full swing, transporting scientists and deep space archeologists to the outer regions in search of undiscovered carbon energy resources. A small group of amateur communication pundits have intercepted celestial signals containing segments of interstellar emissions, causing an emergency reroute of all resources to the HD 24160 constellation - where known violent disruptions spawn perpetual black holes that has caused great disruption of discovery missions in the past. However, due to the complete depletion of natural resources across adjacent solar systems, this seemingly doomed mission must succeed in order to launch the Re-Genesis of life on Earth and surrounding planets.",

            "about": "\"Found deep in a mine in southern Chihuahua Mexico, these crystals were formed in a natural cave totally enclosed in bedrock. When I first stepped into the cavern it was like walking into the Land of the Giants. I have often admired crystal geodes held in my hand, but when photographing these unique natural structures it was almost impossible to get any sense of scale. This is a geode full of spectacular crystals as tall as pine trees, and in some cases greater in circumference. They have formed beautiful\ncrystals that are a translucent gold and silver in color, and come in many incredible forms and shapes. Some of the largest are essentially columnar in shape and stand thirty to fifty feet high and three to four feet in diameter. Many of the smaller examples are four to six feet in circumference, have many incredible geometrical shapes, and probably weigh in excess of ten tons. The columnar pillars are at first the most striking shape, but later I noticed there were thousands of \"sharks teeth\" up\nto three feet high placed row upon row and dispersed at odd angles throughout the caverns. While some of the crystals are attached to the ceiling walls and floors of the cave as might be expected, some exist in great masses of spikes and almost float in air. These crystals seem to defy gravity, as they must weigh several tons.\"\nwww.canyonsworldwide.com/crystals/",

            "about": "This album was originally only available to people who purchased all 4 of my Advent albums which I released in December of 2018. after some people heard it, they suggested that the general public needed to be able to experience this album and so I'm releasing it into the wild.\nEve of Morning is a 77 minute long-form ambient guitar track. Though there is a track of the same title on my lost archives album, this new version is an expansive reinterpretation of one of the 4 or 5 themes of the original piece.\nThe original Eve of Morning was composed on December 31, 1991.\nif you'd like to hear the lost archive album, which goes back to my roots of composition in the early 90's for the most part, you can visit  scottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/the-lost-early-archives-remastered\nI thank you for your continued support of my life's purpose in sound exploration.",

It really is an outstanding adventure; with moments of romanticism, mellowness, compassion and avant-garde flights to the moon. Like an orbit, it launches off unto deep space - but not without coming back home every once in a while.\"\nWings of an Angel",

            "about": "These tracks were written between May 17 and June 12, 2024 and were inspired by the poetry of St. John of the Cross.\n\"On a dark night,\nInflamed by love-longing—\nO exquisite risk!—\nUndetected I slipped away.\nMy house, at last, grown still.\nSecure in the darkness,\nI climbed the secret ladder in disguise—\nO exquisite risk!—\nConcealed by the darkness.\nMy house, at last, grown still.\nThat sweet night: a secret.\nNobody saw me;\nI did not see a thing.\nNo other light, no other guide\nThan the one burning in my heart.\nThis light led the way\nmore clearly than the risen sun\nTo where he was waiting for me\n—The one I knew so intimately—\nIn a place where no one could find us.\nO night, that guided me!\nO night, sweeter than sunrise!\nO night, that joined lover with Beloved!\nLover transformed in Beloved!\nUpon my blossoming breast,\nWhich I cultivated just for him,\nHe drifted into sleep,\nAnd while I caressed him,\nA cedar breeze touched the air. . . .\nI lost myself. Forgot myself.\nI lay my face against the Beloved’s face.\nEverything fell away and I left myself behind,\nAbandoning my cares\namong the lilies, forgotten.\"",

What he submitted was nothing less than an epic, three CD-length release that was an immediate challenge.\nWhen Scott says that he has a “minimal album in mind” he isn’t referring to the scope, size or the concept of a project. Even the single track that comprises the first part of this series of releases is 78 minutes long.\nScott’s idea was to dig into the realm of sensory deprivation (also known as perceptual isolation): the area of study in psychology which has also been used in alternative medicines.\nThis has been an area of study that has been interesting and controversial on a number of levels. Some psychological studies have shown there are benefits to using sensory deprivation within limited time frames, while others have shown there are severe negative effects that can occur when the human mind and body are isolated from external stimuli.\nOn this first part of the series, Scott Takes on the broad concept of this subject: Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy or REST as it is commonly known. REST is the name given to several different treatments that have been used in studies over the last 50 years. The concept for these sensory deprivation based therapies were derived originally for military use in interrogating prisoners.",

The individuals were locked into chambers deep inside a nuclear bunker for forty eight hours. At the conclusion of the experiment several of the participants were unable to complete simple tasks, it was estimated their\nmental capacity had deteriorated, with one subjects facilities deteriorating by 36 percent. All of the men in the study were also found to be much more suggestable, although the women were not.\nTheta State is the brainwave that is seen as marking the transition from being awake to sleeping. During some types of tests / therapy (primarily Flotation REST) the Theta State can last for several minutes, This state is often seen as contributing to enhanced creativity or problem solving.",

Some psychological studies have shown there are benefits to using sensory deprivation within limited time frames, while others have shown there are severe negative effects that can occur when the human mind and body are isolated from external stimuli.\nPart Three of this series deals with the two most common forms of Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy: Chamber REST and Flotation REST.\nChamber REST is a form of experiment / therapy where the subject is instructed to lie on a platform for 24 hours in a room that reduces sound to a low\nlevel (typically around 80db). No mechanical devices are used to restrict the subject, only the instructions define the restrictions. Food, water and bathroom facilities are at the decision of the tester, Subjects are generally allowed to leave before the 24 hours has concluded, but few do.\nFlotation REST is a form of experiment / therapy where the subject is instructed to lay supine in a tank containing a specially prepared solution of water and Epsom salts. Attempting to turn over in the solution requires special effort. The test typically lasts for approximately one hour, during which the brain’s activity remains active emitting either alpha or beta brainwaves for about forty minutes. However, during the last twenty minutes of the experiment,\nthe brain typically starts emitting theta waves for an extended period (several minutes as opposed to the brief occurrences prior to regular sleep).\nThere is much debate over which of these treatments is a better form of therapy due to their inherent differences. Each of the treatments has a different emphasis on the type of questions being asked, and the nature of the human mind.",

            "about": "These 6 tracks were created from short wave broadcasts, no synthesizers were utilized in the creation of this album.\nIt's a strange psychedelic trip in the context of a rather simple event, falling asleep while the television is on, a normal thing that happens to a lot of people. However, what this person encounters in dreams and hypnogogic imagery is anything but normal, dreams of drowning, murder and imprisonment all come to the surface during the night as his sleeping mind meanders from scene to scene as the television gives off a comfortable glow and continues to broadcast it's programming.\nThe audio samples in encountering the ghostly vision of Tatyana Prikhodko were taken from the October 28, 2013 broadcast of the American edition of the voice of Russia, at 2300GMT-9395kHz.\nThe audio samples in into the blackness goes the unwilling prisoner were taken from the October 29, 2013 broadcast of the American edition of the voice of Russia, at 2200GMT-9395kHz.\nThe audio samples in Slowly She sips the nectar that will transform her world were taken from the October 6, 2013 broadcast of the American edition of the voice of Russia, at 2200-2400GMT-9465kHz.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nThe Fetish Emporium is a project I've been working on over the last 5 years during which time I brought together some alternative versions of previously released tracks along with a lot of new material.\nThis album of 58 tracks clocks in at just over 39 hours, and represents the largest amount of noise, industrial and dark ambient i've ever assembled in one singular collection.\nThis is certinly not the last we'll hear from our ladies of lust, perversion and debauchery as these unsavory characters still have a lot of experiences to bring forth and they love sharing and playing with others.",

            "about": "These 14 tracks were written between April 25 and April 30th 2024 and, though this project wasn't intended to be an album, that's what happened.\nHere's the story:\nBeing a member of The Cousin Silas Emporium on Facebook for a number of years, there was an invitation to be part of a compilation album where artists wrote a track inspired by that American art collective known as the Residents.\nFor a month or so, I didn't feel that I had the capability of writing such a track as the residents wasn't a group I was very familiar with, outside of their 1973 debut album called \"Meet the Residents\".\nI sent Cousin Silas the track called Collywobbles and he liked it so this gave me the confidence to try my hand at a couple more tracks.\nSubsequently, I sent him Arfvedsonite, Cattywampus, Zonked and Floccinaucinihilipilification, the title track of this weird album.\nI couldn't let this idea go so I wrote more and more until the project grew to 14 tracks at almost 80 minutes of genre jumping nonsensical sonic meanderings whose titles are just as outrageous as the music itself.\nThe intention was to find the silliest words possible but to select only those which, at least in my mind, had a relational connection to the sound or feeling I was attempting to convey through these improvisations or, in some cases, the intentionally careful stacking together and placement of loops in relationship to each other.",

            "about": "prepare ye for the worst political election in decades with the two worst candidates to ever have the desire to be president. Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump are both equally unqualified for the mantle of leadership they seek and this album suggests where they really should be, buried under the foundation and concealed behind the wall of isolation that will make America great again.\nIf you are fed up with the corrupt two-party system in America and the ineffective deplorable candidates it produces, I urge you to vote your conscience and consider a third-party alternative, all the while, ignoring the fools who will try to convince you that a vote for such a candidate is a wasted effort.\nAll source material for this new political protest album came from the first and second shit shows which were wrongfully classified as presidential debates.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nAfter having several successful Scott lawlor and Friends compilations, I decided to do something similar with my noise side project.\nThese 12 tracks were recorded between June and August of 2023 in many parts of the world including The united States, Malaysia, Austria, The united Kingdom, France and Canada.\nyou'll hear collaborations among musicians and sound alchemists who I have collaborated with over the years as well as new people who I have had the pleasure to work with for the first time. My deep gratitude goes to each of them for giving me the opportunity to collaborate with them, improvising over material which they have provided for the project or them improvising over sound worlds that I have given to them.\nThis album consists of around 3 hours of brand new music in collaboration with 12 fantastic artists, all of whom, you should check out and support where you're able. All are listed in the credits section.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nAfter having several successful Scott lawlor and Friends compilations, I decided to do something similar with my noise side project.\nThese tracks were recorded between June and October of 2023 in many parts of the world including The united States, Malaysia, Austria, The united Kingdom, France, Poland and Canada.\nyou'll hear collaborations among musicians and sound alchemists who I have collaborated with over the years as well as new people who I have had the pleasure to work with for the first time. My deep gratitude goes to each of them for giving me the opportunity to collaborate with them, improvising over material which they have provided for the project or them improvising over sound worlds that I have given to them.\nThis album consists of around 2 and a half hours of brand new music in collaboration with 10 fantastic artists, all of whom, you should check out and support where you're able. All are listed in the credits section.",

            "about": "I return to more ethereal drones and extended choral melodies on this album. These 5 tracks were improvised with no overdubbing in mid 2017.\n\"There is always a moment of peace and tranquillity that can be found from an album by Scott Lawlor, he has truly set himself solidly within the ranks of the most excellent of ambient musicians of the 21st century and here today we are going to take a musical voyage into the very far reaches of the universe with this new offering entitled From The First Breath of a Star.\nI have been very much into the ambiance of space music lately, it brings a certain serenity to the soul, and as we start our voyage, we are gifted a piece that does just that from the off called, Mysterious Life Filled the Night. This is an extremely floaty opener, one that contains a mysterious but almost infinite ethereal voice to guide us, and Lawlor’s synths manifest a vast realm to walk within.\nIf you adore long form music then you are going to be elated with this next vast offering called Lost In The Process Of Earthly Dissolution. Scott Lawlor as a musician has always been an artist that speaks to me, his music is the apex of what we would call ambient music these days, and here on this lengthy offering one can simply drift within its halls of utter breath taking quality. The smoothness of this piece has an almost atmospheric energy of being totally limitless. This is also a very clever arrangement too, as we arrive at around the seven minute mark, there seems to be a level of apprehension, a sense of suddenly realising a sense of loss perhaps, one that seems to increase as we float forever on the winds of a timeless dimension.\nWe now seem to find a fixed point to focus on and this is called There is Naught but Space and Shadow. This is a moment of clarity perhaps and the energy of the music brings us a gentle, but totally empty void to be becalmed within. The performance on synths here is now on another level entirely, and Lawlor seemingly is creating an oasis of tone for us to view our journey from, one that has been delicately put together like a rich tapestry of shade and hue, a very crafted an intelligent offering indeed.\nWe have now arrived at the penultimate offering of the album which is also the longest track off the release; this is called Like a Drop of Water Into the Ocean. One of the things I adore about the music of Scott Lawlor is the consistency of ambience you get from his compositions and here is a perfect example, with over twenty minutes of utterly atmospheric pitch and timbre. As you listen to this track may find yourself just staring out of the window at life, time passes almost incidentally; Lawlor has perhaps created the ultimate timeless offering here, in an almost meditative musical moment of ambient bliss.\nSo were here, at the very last portal of the album called From the First Breath of a Star which also happens to be the title track. There is a real sense of power here that seems to be increasing in volume and intensity within the construction of this composition. This last gift from the artist probably shows us our original birthplace, from the continuum that resides at the very core of each and every star in the universe. The performance here is quite empowering, and continues to elevate the energy of the arrangement as it continues towards its conclusion.\nFrom the First Breath of a Star is without doubt true ambient music, it allows us the listener to drift in its vastness and enjoy the calmness of its serene tones. Scott Lawlor, with the release of this album has gifted us an album of tranquillity, a collection of music that one can just be at total peace with, I think this is one that I personally will enjoy playing endlessly, as I hope you will as well.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nGerontophilia is a sexual preference for people that are much older. People with gerontophilia, known as gerontophiles, may fantasize about older people and choose them as sexual partners.\nThe term gerontophilia was first used by the German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing in 1901. It comes from the Greek word geron, meaning elderly person, and philia, or love.",

But give to me, your servant, a spirit of sober-mindedness, humility, patience, and love.\nYes, O Lord and King, grant me to see my own sins and not to judge my brother, since you are blessed to the ages. Amen.\nSaint Ephrem the Syrian (303–373)",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nHamartophilia refers to strong sensual urges resulting from doing wrong or going against the moral code of society. It brings to mind the likes of Bonnie and Clyde, who were partners in the bedroom and in crime. The danger of doing bad deeds gets the heart pumping from fear of being caught. For those with hamartophilia, danger also increases sensual desires.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nHierophilia is a fetish for religious or sacred objects, places, and people. People afflicted with these urges feel sexual arousal at the sight and feel of these things and people.\nThey may fulfill these urges by masturbating with religious paraphernalia, such as crosses and church pews; or, performing sexual acts in places of worship, such as altars and confession booths.\ninstruments used on this album:\nMysteria by native instruments\nAlien skies, deep impact, and Dark Skies by zero-g\nall tracks run through a combination of guitar rig 6 and reaktor by native instruments.",

            "about": "A brand new collaboration and this one is a bit noisier than the other three. The idea came aobut when I asked Wings of an Angel to do a remix of my track called \"I No Longer Love Blue Skies\" from the compilation of the same name. You can find the entire compilation at the following link.\nsound4good.bandcamp.com/album/i-no-longer-love-blue-skies\nThe subsequent two tracks are remixes of his remix with additional synth work by me on the last track of the album.\nAs always, thank you for listening and for your support of our music.",

The story in the East is divided into two separate persecutions of the\nCatholics, at the end of each of which stands the figure of an image-worshipping Empress (Irene and Theodora).\nFor further reading, visit  www.newadvent.org/cathen/07620a.htm",

            "about": "commentary by George De Bruin:\n\"On Improvisations for Piano, Scott Lawlor has entered a territory that is familiar to many artists and yet isn’t as common as it probably should be.\nOne artist paying homage to another artist within their work is a fairly common practice. Typically they do this within the body of their own work: find\nsome little nooks or crannies in which to work in a reference to another artist, or adapt a certain part of that artist’s style to fit their own.\nHowever, in some cases, an artist can be so moved by another's work that they set out to write a whole piece in that artist’s style. In the extreme, they might write a whole series of works in that artist’s style.\nSuch is the case of Improvisations for Piano. Scott Lawlor has created a whole body of works inspired by the work of composer Galina Ustvolskaya (1919-2006).\nUstvolskaya was known for developing her own, unique style of composition.\nTaking Ustvolskaya as a starting point, Scott launches into considerable depths exploring unique choices of instruments: cello, flute, bass clarinet and\norgan, all paired with piano.\nIt’s a work that is a fascinating listen, engrossing from beginning to end. It’s an exploration of the intersection of ambient, jazz and classical music.\"\n\"Improvisations For Piano is a very dark ambient album from Scott Lawlor, one of the most prolific composers on the planet. The five tracks on the album are improvisations for solo piano, piano and cello, piano and organ, piano and flute, and piano and bass clarinet. Experimental, edgy, dark and moody are words that come to mind while listening to this album. In other words, if you are looking for a Jim Brickman clone, this album probably won’t work for you. Some of this music is downright spooky and some of it feels like deep space music with atmospheric droning and ethereal reverb. The five tracks range in length from eight minutes to seventeen, so each improvisation takes the listener on a sonic journey to places that are sometimes peaceful, but are more likely to be somewhat unsettling. The liner notes explain that this album was inspired by the work of Galina Ustvolskaya (1919-2006), a Russian composer of classical music. I am not familiar with her music, so I can’t make a comparison, but Ustvolskaya studied with Shostakovich during World War II and was known for developing her own unique style of composition. The liner notes also refer to the album as “an exploration of the intersection of ambient, jazz and classical music.” That’s a broad enough description to be quite accurate.\nImprovisations For Piano begins with the only solo piano track. Actually, there are some synth shadings behind the piano which make it even more atmospheric. This is the most peaceful track of the five and my favorite. It’s still edgy and very ambient, but isn’t nearly as dark as some of the other pieces. “Improvisation For Piano and Cello” gets really dark and murky and would be perfect for a very intense film soundtrack. Some of the cello parts seem to go much lower than the normal range for an acoustic cello, but the deep bass tones create an inky black mood and feelings of being very lost or in imminent danger, possibly in deep space. “Improvisation For Piano and Organ” is the seventeen-minute track with the organ and piano taking turns in the foreground. While in the background, the organ produces mostly a drone sound from the deep bass, and sometimes it produces a low rumble that the higher notes flash and flicker around. This one doesn’t really feel like space music to me, but it is definitely dark and ambient. I suspect that the flute in “Improvisation for Piano and Flute” is a bass flute because of its tonal range. This improv is a little bit lighter, although much of the piano part stays in the deep bass, giving it weight. The last track is “Improvisation for Piano and Bass Clarinet.” With both instruments residing mostly in the bass range with occasional flickers of light in the upper octaves of the piano, this one also stays quite dark and “spacey.” It could heighten the suspense and intensity of a movie or television show as well as providing a rather unusual background for a social gathering!\nImprovisations For Piano isn’t for everyone, but it is certainly different from anything I’ve heard or reviewed recently. If you’re up for a unique listening experience, the album is available from Amazon, iTunes and Bandcamp.\"\nKathy Parsons\nMainlyPiano.com",

            "about": "This album was originally released on the Cerebral Audio label in mid 2018 and I've decided to upload it here after doing a bit of remastering of the tracks with software I didn't have when first submiting this release.\nHere are the liner notes that George De Bruin originally wrote for the album.\n\"Scott Lawlor returns to CerebralAudio with a new Piano Improvisations release.\nUnlike his previous release, he has turned his hand to using electronics instead of natural instruments. This adds a different set of textures and depths to this recording which brings about a completely different quality.\nScott takes the electronics works in very different directions on this release. Sometimes noisy and harsh, sometimes soft and subtle. There is no single type of style of electronics, nor any single school of synthesis that he focuses on.\nThe piano work on this release is as multi-dimensional as his use of electronics. Sometimes soft, sometimes harsh. Sometimes melodic, while other time rhythmic. Scott seeks to find different grounds between tonality and atonality in this work, often finding complex tonalities between the worlds of the acoustic and electronic.\n(And he even sneaks in a child's nursery rhyme or two along the way for good measure.\"",

            "about": "Nominated for ambient album of 2018 by One World Music Radio and Included in Kathy's list of favorites for that year:\nmainlypiano.com/favorites/kathys-favorites-2018\nThe death of my baby brother is something I never thought I'd live to endure, after all, it's not the natural order of things. It brings chaos of unspeakable proportions internally and shows itself externally in simple things like forgetting things I would usually remember or reacting emotionally to events or words which otherwise wouldn't have such an impact on me.\nIn this moment, I still feel like it's a bad dream, something that happened to someone else and yet, when I write these words, I am emotional so it must have really occurred on that Thursday night in November of 2017.\nGrief is a strange animal, it comes and goes unexpectedly and unpredictably, one moment washing me to the depths of a bottomless ocean of unrelenting tears and then, a cognitive denial that says \"this didn't happen because I wasn't in the same room he was in when he died after taking his last rasping breath\".\nThis album then, is an album of grief and sorrow because I will never be the same after losing a part of myself. At the same time, it is a forward looking concept because The reality is that I have to create a new normal and know that there is healing after grief, and the healing comes in the memories, the times when I will be able to talk about Joe and not cry because of the emptiness but smile and look fondly on the memories I have of the life and legacy that he left for all of us, himself, his humor, his love, the great man that he was and the spirit of calm that he will always be, watching over all those who he held dear, knowing that he's just around the corner, on another plane of existence, waiting for the time when we will all be reunited in love when the afterlife is upon us and we all travel through the door of eternity to a new cosmic address.\nThere are few who understand the pain of grief other than those who go through it, and then arrive on the other side of the darkness of this most testing of emotions, this release entitled In a Dark Room, a Single Candle is Lit in Memoriam for Those Whose Lives Were Incomplete, is the continuing journey from that darkness of the loss of his younger brother for the artist, the healing grows with each minute that passes and this cathartic voyage of sound will most certainly help that process immensely.\nThe stillness and lack of linear time in the first, and quite emotional and breath taking opus of, If You Watch, You Will See the Hand of God Putting the Stars Back in Their Skies One By One, is outstanding. The deepness of this track must not be skimmed over; here is a sense of vastness that only the infinite universe can provide, the ethereal and mystical elements of Lawlor’s synths manifest something almost incalculable in terms of a dimensional musical infrastructure, when you listen to this, you are completely there, with no form, like we all must be at some stage, at one and within the all-encompassing nature of this vast continuum called the universe.\nIf Tears Could Build a Stairway has the energy of light and shadow about its overall construction. On one hand, the performance has a lighter mood about its essence, but the underlying juxtaposition of musical genius holds firm with such a deeply felt sense of sadness. This duel natured offering holds the reality of an imploring emotive truth, that if he could, he would build a river of musical tears, to bridge the void and change time itself.\nWe can now, with great respect move to the next piece entitled Your End, Which is Endless, Is As a Snowflake Dissolving In the Pure Air. The cleverness of arrangement and creation of composition is strong in this one, and if you listen closely you will indeed get a sense through the performance on keyboards, of that very snowflake disappearing into what appears to be a state of nothingness, but as we know there is more than a single snowflake, and when ones form changes, it then manifests itself into something new entirely, so listen to this track intently and feel what you hear.\nOn Tears Are the Natural Bleeding of An Emotional Wound, we have a strong and empowering long form composition, the process of feeling the pain grows with an intensity that is like nothing else you will ever feel. This near on twenty minute opus of reflection and emotion contains some of the most incredibly played synth work you may have heard in the ambient genre. The organ here is paramount to the power of the piece, the floating nature of the track partners that perfectly with an almost symbiotic level of musical attraction. This isn’t just an arrangement of a dark ambient nature; Scott Lawlor is literally opening up realms of sanctuary to heal within, one after the other.\nWe now arrive at the portal of Unable Are the Loved to Die. For love is Immortality. The title of this track is a statement of complete truth, but there are many weaves and corridor’s to navigate and travel within it before you find your own refuge. This dream like arrangement is a powerful safe harbour to reside in; its swirling synths create a determined sense of energy that is quite addictive to get lost within and manifests the energy of a latent feeling of hope.\nClosed Eyes, Heart not Beating, But a Living Love, this is our last room of musical emotion that we will visit on this venture through grief. At just short of half an hour, we have a true long form symphony of the soul, perhaps even representing a journey of souls? Musically this is so very moving and quite heart rendering, but even through desperation we can get inspiration. The composition perhaps relays the reality of the ending of the physical body and the transition to that universal oneness I spoke of earlier. However those left behind; still have to deal with memory, the quietness of silence and feelings of regret. All this is within here for me, it is a most vast and lengthy arrangement, but trust me, you will not even notice the time at all, if you simply let go and allow the senses to bathe in this quite powerful opus of emotion.\nIn a Dark Room, a Single Candle is Lit in Memoriam for Those Whose Lives Were Incomplete, is Scott Lawlor’s continuing journey of healing, and music is the key to that door of emotional freedom; it is the panacea to cure all ills, and within this release Lawlor’s honesty and integrity shines powerfully, and his musical genius makes him the creator of six ambient realms and a myriad of musical dimensional sanctuary’s to take refuge within.\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio\n\"In my review of Scott Lawlor’s previous work Transition, I introduced him and his unique artistry with an overall suggestion inspired when I realized he\nhas over 200 releases in the ambient music genre. I wrote: “If you are into soulful, thought provoking and consciousness expanding ambient music, Scott\nLawlor is a composer and artist who needs to be on your musical radar.” A casual visit to his bandcamp site  (scottlawlor.bandcamp.com/music)  can\nbe a bit overwhelming because of so much content that reaches back a long way. So where to begin immersing in these sounds, poetic titles and essays about\nhis inspiration? It’s wonderful when artists are so prolific, but everyone needs the perfect entry point.\nFor me, that point is the incredible trilogy (so far) which he has written in tribute to his beloved brother Joe, his struggle with stage 4 cancer, his\npassing/transition and now the emotional struggle in the wake of losing a beloved soul far too soon. The first recording, the “open door” to the experience,\nwas Look Unto the Heavens, an expansive search for a meaning to suffering that sets up Transition.\nLawlor’s just released third recording in this series has a more elaborate title, perhaps indicative of the multiple levels of emotional upheaval the grieving\nexperience, followed by a generally sanguine acceptance of the reality of what has happened and an attempt to discover a place in his heart for creating\na new normal – even though nothing will ever be the same. In his general notes on “In a Dark Room, A Single Candle is Lit in Memoriam for Those Whose Lives\nWere Incomplete,” the  artist writes that smiles propelled by wonderful memories that help fill the emptiness. Lawlor mentions Joe’s “humor, his love,\nthe great man he was and the spirit of calm that he will always be, watching over all those who he held dear.” As we listen to Lawlor’s emotional, sometimes\nturbulent but ultimately soothing and healing outpouring, we can sense that his brother is not far off, guiding Lawlor’s hands over the synth and piano\nand then easing away to wait for a heavenly reunion that faith will bring them one day.\nLawlor sets the stage for the 70+ minute journey with a nearly 11 minute, chorally enhanced piece that introduces his sense of faith and artful imagery\nconnected to his music: “if you watch, you will see the hand of God putting the stars back in their skies one by one.” I love how he provides such a gorgeous\nvisual for us as we close our eyes and listen in on a choir crying out reverently but also with questions (like the Psalmists of old) to the Almighty.\nAs the spacey ambience grows in intensity, those voices seem to rise to become part of a higher realm deeper universal truth. The voices likewise ease\nfrom soft to loud and back as if trying to find their way between mourning and healing. It’s a beautiful tension.\nExternal YouTube frame\nPlay\n5:32\nExternal YouTube frame end\nThe voices are in a full embrace of our senses to help guide the way to the second track, “If tears could build a stairway,” a hypnotic, meditative peace\nthat moves from heavier dark droning tones (presumably, the heaviness of a heart in transition) to a lighter atmosphere underscored with the sense of darker,\nlingering sadness. It’s as if a stairway is being constructed with sadness at its base, and with every step we rise higher into a slightly less burdened\nfuture – all the while knowing that the sadness will be at the core of everything for a long time.\nJust as I loved “The Last Goodbye” on Transition, I connect powerfully to track 3 because of Lawlor’s gorgeous piano melody, which brings all the light\nand dark tones of universal contemplation down to a very tangible human level. “Your end, which is endless, is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air”\nis stark but thoughtful, offering a beautiful way to view the ephemeral nature of love. It’s here, its physical manifestation stays for a time, then dissipates\ninto a much larger and ultimately more meaningful realm. The shifting shades of darkness and light, divinity and humanity are stunning too behold here.\nOn “Tears are the natural bleeding of an Emotional Wound,” Lawlor introduces the sacred realm with dramatic long notes on an organ as transcendent harmonic\ncolors swirl around, pull back and re-emerge. As the 20 minute piece progresses, the organ takes powerful precedence then recedes and returns – implying\ntension, wanting to be reverent in the presence of the divine, but still having doubts in its goodness and ability to heal and reconcile. Emotions are\nmessy, chaotic things sometimes and they get in the way of the peace we seek. But we are always striving.\nThe symphonic crescendo at the end of Track 4 bleeds into the beginning of the next piece, “Unable are the loved to die. For love  is immortality,” a louder,\nbrasher, bolder expression of love, hope, faith and all the struggles inherent in embodying the better angels of our nature in the light of what we have\nlost. There is a clanging bell sound, prominent then distant, the perfect metaphor for the gathering then dissipating chaos. Lawlor takes his time with\nthe closing 27 minute track “Closed Eyes, heart not beating, but a living love,” a bright awakening full of horn sounds creating light above the swirl\nof emotional ambience beneath it.\nThe title of this piece sums up everything about the transition of a loved one and our response to it. They’re at peace, eyes closed, heart not beating,\nbut yet they live, their love fills us endlessly and becomes part of the universe in ways it could never achieve in human form. Lawlor infuses this expansive\nsoundtrack to those powerful contemplations with moments of rising light and dark echoing emptiness, but ultimately fills that sense of loss with heavenly\ninfusions of energy that helps our hearts and love itself go on.\nUltimately, what anyone writes about a project like In a Dark Room…or its predecessors are simply words that point to an experience that cannot be quantified.\nIn losing a dear musician friend once, I wrote a whole book about him and our friendship, to celebrate a legacy and inspire. I was limited by language.\nI feel a similar limitation in listening to so called healing songs with lyrics that are specific and don’t capture the whole experience. The incredible\nthing about what Lawlor has done is opening a door to this dying/mourning/longing/healing realm that is beyond language and thus not subject to words trying\nto capture what ultimately cannot be expressed with them. His music is a blessing to all who have been there, and all who will be – and all those who simply\nwant to discover what ambient new age music is all about.\"\nreview by Jonathan Widran\nwww.jwvibe.com\n\"In a Dark Room, a Single Candle is Lit in Memoriam for Those Whose Lives Were Incomplete is the third ambient album in a trilogy by Scott Lawlor. The series began when Scott’s younger brother, Joe, was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer and was at stage four of the disease. The music explores the search for answers and the strength to get through such a crisis. Look Unto the Heavens (the first album) was released in July 2017. The second album, Transition, was composed very shortly after Joe’s death and describes some of the feelings and experiences Scott had during that time. It was released in December 2017. This third album is an expression of the emotional aftermath that such a traumatic event has on those who remain - grief, disbelief that the event ever happened, and the long process of healing. It was released in May 2018. As I mentioned in my review of Transition, I sincerely hope that by putting such intense and personal experiences to music, Scott was and is able to derive some of the healing comfort that I’m sure many others will receive from this music.\nAlthough this album contains six individual pieces, there are no breaks between them, offering 74 minutes of uninterrupted music. This album is much darker and more despairing than the previous two and reflects that the full impact of a loss such as this is often delayed for months or even years. In Scott’s words: “Grief is a strange animal, it comes and goes unexpectedly and unpredictably, one moment washing me to the depths of a bottomless ocean of unrelenting tears and then, a cognitive denial that says ‘this didn't happen because I wasn't in the same room he was in when he died after taking his last rasping breath.’”\nThe six tracks all have very descriptive titles and range in duration from just under five minutes to twenty-seven minutes. The album begins with “If you watch, you will see the hand of God putting the stars back in their skies one by one,” an expression of deep grief with choral voices (no lyrics) and ambient orchestral sounds. “If tears could build a stairway” expresses profound loss and a sense of unreality - the numbness that follows a crisis. “Your end, which is endless, is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air” adds the piano to the ambient strings and voices, expressing a strong feeling of solitude. “Tears are the natural bleeding of an Emotional Wound” exchanges the piano for the organ, going into a pitch black expression of despair and loss. “Unable are the loved to die. For love is immortality” offers fragile feelings of hope. “Closed eyes, heart not beating, but a living love” is the 27-minute sixth track and is a bit more orchestral, although still very ambient. Emotions gradually flow from one to another with subtle changes as healing begins ever so slowly.\nScott Lawlor has created a monumental work with these three albums. It is intensely personal and yet expresses feelings that are universal. Through this music, Joe Lawlor’s spirit and the love that his family and others had and have for him will live on and continue to touch many lives.\"\nKathy Parsons\nMainlyPiano.com",

            "about": "A mother warns her son that if he does not behave she will summon the Noon Witch to take him away. He does not behave, and the witch arrives at the stroke of noon. The witch, described as a horrible creature, demands the child. The mother, terrified that the witch has actually come, grabs her son, and the witch begins chasing them. Finally the mother faints, grasping her child. Later that day, the father arrives home, and finds his wife passed out with the dead body of their son in her arms. The mother had accidentally smothered their son while protecting him from the witch. The story ends with the father's lament over the terrible event.\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Noon_Witch\nSevenism and I reworked the Noonday Witch by Antonín Dvorák into a haunting suite of three tracks which we hope will chill you during this frightful season of Halloween.\nNox Intempesta is the project of myself and Sevenism begun in 2015 on the ambient online forum at  ambientonline.org.\nYou can find other works by Sevenism at\nsevenism.bandcamp.com\nsoundcloud.com/sevenism",

            "about": "Wouldn’t it be a relief to simply press a button and erase the abhorrent memories in your mind? Or would you rather confront the truth, whatever it may\nbe, and learn from it instead? In Greek mythology, you were presented with a choice. You could either remember all your knowledge and experiences when\nyou passed into the afterlife, or forget everything. What would you choose?\nLethe is one of the five rivers in Hades, the underworld\nin Greek mythology. In classic Greek, Lethe means oblivion, forgetfulness or concealment. In keeping with classical mythology, Lethe was also the name\nof a Greek spirit: the spirit of forgetfulness and oblivion.\nThe Lethe River is believed to have flowed through the caves of Hypnos, the god of sleep, in the underworld. The entrance to the cave was said to be populated with poppies and other hypnotic plants. No light or sound ever entered the cave. The river bordered Elysium, the paradise where only heroes, and mortals related to gods, were sent to live an immortal life of happiness.\nAll those who drank from the river experienced forgetfulness, and Lethe’s murmuring sound would induce drowsiness. When the souls of the dead passed into\nthe afterlife, they had to drink from the river in order to forget their past life and be ready for their reincarnation.",

            "about": "“The Flowing Light of the Deity” is one of the most important German works of women's mysticism.\nMechthild of Magdeburg (c. 1212-c. 1282) was the first woman to write poetry in German as a mystic and theologian in the 13th century.\nShe did not spend the majority of her life in a monastery, but lived in the middle of the city of Magdeburg and took part in life. As a woman, she discussed\nin the social discourses of the time, which was extremely unusual. With her contemporary criticism of the real religious life in the church, she consequently caused a sensation.\nHer book “The flowing Light of Deity” describes the mystical process of the marriage of the human soul with Christ and represents her life's work.\nWhat does this have to do with ambient music?\nI began this album with the thought that it is often an arduous path to want to explore the secrets of life that have to do with spiritual growth, with personal maturity. You often try, fail and start all over again, until perhaps success rewards all effort, whatever that may look like individually.\nScott had the inspiration during our collaboration to connect this woman, who has clearly lived her convictions passionately and without compromise, to these sounds.\nThe intensity of the sounds of our album carries her passion into our time.",

            "about": "Last year, around this time, I released Theotokos, an album of short tracks inspired by the advent meditations given by Rev. Kimberly Braun.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/theotokos\nOne year later, she reached out to me and asked me if I would be open to composing original minimal music to serve as the background for the meditations of the current Advent season.\nI was honored that she would make such a request and have been enjoying creating these tracks and so have decided to release them for your listening pleasure and perhaps for your personal journey of spiritual growth and meditation, if you have such a belief system.",

Kimberly Braun.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/theotokos\nOne year later, she reached out to me and asked me if I would be open to composing original minimal music to serve as the background for the meditations of the current Advent season.\nI was honored that she would make such a request and have been enjoying creating these tracks and so have decided to release them for your listening pleasure and perhaps for your personal journey of spiritual growth and meditation, if you have such a belief system.",

            "about": "You hadn't planned for it to happen, you were just playing outside like most children did in those days, and then the brutal attack that left you hovering at the threshold between life and death.\nYou were aware of your impending death but, simultaneously, there was something else happening, an exit from this dimension to another plane of existence where you encountered an all-encompassing supernatural presence, she called herself the guardian of the sky and she told you that it wasn't your time to go.\nYou returned to this life with much trepidation and sadness, rebelling against love and hope until the moment came and you realized that you had a greater purpose here, something to overcome all the bitterness and rebellion, and it was your mission to give the dying hope and love during their journeys from this life to the next.",
            "credits": "released July 16, 2021\nI'd like to thank Bruce Moallem AKA God Body Disconnect for his invaluable feedback in helping this album to be what I feel is one of my finest sonic achievements to date.

            "about": "700 million light years from Earth lies a virtually empty area of space so vast and with galaxies so distant from each other that if our galaxy, The Milky Way, were to be located there other galaxies would not have been discovered until the 1960's. This vacant region is known as the Boötes Void.\nWelcome to the spookiest part of the universe, where the emptiness immerses the traveler as a barren, blank and black sea of nothingness.\n\"Journey Through the Boötes Void\" is an aural guided tour through this enigmatic 250-million light-year expanse, the largest known void in our universe. Sit back, clear your mind and prepare yourself for an expedition of space focused both outward and inward.",

            "about": "This dark ambient work was inspired by an astronomical event that occurred during the week of July 16th through the 22nd, 1994, where fragments of a comet called Shoemaker Levy 9 slammed into Jupiter.\nBesides my Ensoniq TS12 synthesizer, I also incorporated the sounds of Jupiter, though mangled a bit as explained a bit later.\nYou can find the video and audio referenced in the following description at\nwww-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/voyager/v2pws_jupiter_arrival.html\nHere's some information on how these signals were recorded as taken from the above citation itself.\nVoyager PWS VOYAGER-2 PWS:\nARRIVAL AT JUPITER\nThe PWS plasma wave instrument on Voyager 2 recorded these signals as the spacecraft was approaching Jupiter on July 2, 1979, between 15:56 and 16:45 spacecraft event time (essentially UTC), near the bow shock in front of the planet's immense magnetosphere. A variety of plasma wave phenomena heralded our arrival, including Langmuir waves, ion acoustic waves, and others. These are the authentic \"sounds of Jupiter\" unmodified and presented at their original frequency.\nThe PWS wideband waveform instruments on the two Voyager spacecraft sample the electric field on the dipole wire antenna at a rate of 28800 4-bit samples per second, using an automatic gain control. Consequently, the audio is just slightly better than telephone quality. Packets of 1600 samples are acquired, separated by the equivalent of 128 missing samples. Running these packets together results in the playback taking less than real-time (by a factor of 1600 / 1728), and also introduces a slight audible flutter. The amplitudes at the edges of these packets have been smoothed to reduce this flutter, but this is the only modification to the signal.\nThese are by no means the only \"sounds\" that Jupiter makes, but there is nice variety during this hour interval. All of the available measurements during this interval are present but since there are time gaps, the total run time is approximately 27 minutes.\nSome of the audible features unfortunately are the result of onboard interference. The constant tone at 2.4kHz is caused by the spacecraft power supply. The occasional sound like someone pounding a bass drum is the result of spacecraft attitude thruster firings. The sound more like thumping on an oil barrel that tends to occur about 7 seconds into each frame, but sometimes more frequently at a regular cadence, is due to a stepper motor on another instrument. The tones with harmonics that build slowly and end abruptly and appear as multiple horizontal lines in the spectrogram are due to the grid modulation of another instrument. The rest of the signals are the naturally-occurring plasma waves that this Voyager instrument was designed to detect: These are the genuine \"sounds of Jupiter\".\nNow, what do we mean by \"sounds of Jupiter\"? First, the sounds are not typically produced at the planet itself, but in the magnetosphere, the magnetic bubble surrounding the planet. In this particular case, most of the signals are generated from the interaction of the supersonic solar wind colliding with the bow shock ahead of Jupiter's magnetosphere. These waves are not the same as the pressure waves in the atmosphere that we normally think of as sound. However, they do have some similarities. Even though space is an excellent vacuum, it is \"filled\" with particles at a density of typically a few to several hundred particles per cubic centimeter near planets. Most of these are charged and constitute what we call plasma. Being charged, these particles interact with each other without the need to \"collide\" as they do in the atmosphere. Moving charged particles both produce electromagnetic fields and waves and also are moved by electromagnetic fields and waves generated elsewhere. These are \"plasma waves\". Many of these interactions occur at frequencies that are audible to humans. This doesn't mean that a human ear could hear them in space -- the\npressures are far too small -- but it is conceivable that an ultra-sensitive microphone could measure them. In practice, however, it is far easier to measure the oscillations in the accompanying electric and magnetic fields with antennas, and that is just what we do. To produce sound we can hear, we simply do the moral equivalent of hooking our antennas up to an amplifier in order to drive speakers. Plasma waves can be considered \"space audio\".\nThe video shows a series of 48-second-wide spectrograms with an animated cursor that shows the time of the audio track. The amplitude of the signals is color coded with dark blue for the weakest and red for the strongest signals. Low frequencies are at the bottom of the plot and high frequencies are at the top. Time ranges from left to right.\nFor more information on the Voyager project, see  voyager.jpl.nasa.gov\nFor more information on the Voyager plasma wave investigations, see\nwww-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/voyager/\nFor access to the specific data used to produce this video, see:\nwww-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/voyager/data/VGPW_2001/EXTRAS/HTML/JUPITER_ENCOUNTER/V2P2_056/V2P2_056.HTM\nwww-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/voyager/data/VGPW_2001/EXTRAS/HTML/JUPITER_ENCOUNTER/V2P2_057/V2P2_057.HTM\nreview by David Murrieta from A Closer Listen:\n\"If ambient consists of an environment built and modified, then field recordings consist of an environment interpreted and described – the first has architectural\nleanings, while the second is more in the spirit of looking at the world as text. So what happens when, with a bit of humor, you make both come together?\nI am not talking, of course, about the use of found sounds in a wider composition nor the humanist intent of musique concrète, but the union of the conceptual\nunderpinnings of both genres into a music that is fundamentally systemic, made by machines for machines in a mode of communication that is forever speaking\nof mathematical wholes. The result is an imposing feeling of vastness, of echoes growing echoes, of an infinity that, like many of the stars we see every\nnight, has already ended and yet we can still gaze at its life in all its brilliance.\nJupiter is a Cosmic Vacuum Cleaner is based upon the collision of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter as observed in 1994, an event from which astronomers\nwere able to deduce that the largest planet in our good old solar system attracted and absorbed a great deal of comets and asteroids that would otherwise\nimpact upon the surfaces of the rest of the planets. Using the ‘sounds’ of Jupiter’s magnetosphere as collected by the Voyager 2 in 1979, Scott Lawlor\nprocesses the aural qualities of our very own cosmic home appliance in order to construct a place of electronic beeps, scratches, and drones, while at\nthe same time presenting us the way in which the spacecraft ‘interpreted’ the function of the planet. It is significant that the study included in the\nliner notes, written by a NASA scientist, reminds the reader that even if the waves’ frequencies are audible to humans, it doesn’t mean that we could hear\nthem as they are, first in and then from space, as we would a field recording: a machine hears for us, a machine listens and interprets according to its\nown (by now) dated equipment, generating its own noises in the process, one in which there is only a machine-to-machine communication, one in which there\nis no artist to make a second take, to look for an appropriate location to place devices, to listen first and then decide to make art out of what is heard.\nIn this way, this album is both ambient and field recording, situated amongst those rare explorations of the music of the spheres, of the music generated\nby a system that in principle we can understand but is still out of reach, both aurally and conceptually; its drones, while human, also feel irrevocably\nother, strangely harmonious in the manner only engines and electric devices are often capable of being. It is true ‘space music’, all signals, all unknowns\nand humorous – but apt – analogies that can only highlight a cybernetic intuition that details the encounter as a deeply mechanical recognition of interconnectedness,\nbecause to every tone there is a semi-tone there is a micro-tone there is a noise that drones, on and on, something we are not even being able to notice\nwithout the constant reminder that we don’t know how most of it works. The only thing we know is that there is something keeping it all together, but the\nway this album works makes even that seem alien, always already out of reach, always already expanding into yet another electronic sound originated deep\ninside the bowels of some machine or other, be it cosmic or earthly.\"",

Hit more to expand this section to read them all.\nA fantastic vision of Iceland has emerged from this international collaboration, but at the end of the journey it was just a magical dream.....or was it\nEpisode I\nLove, War & Trolls\nIn the rugged, volcanic landscapes of Iceland, a pair of trolls, Grimnir and his wife Yrsa, lived deep within the mountains. With skin as tough as stone and eyes that gleamed with an otherworldly light, they were formidable beings. Yet, despite their fearsome appearances, they lived a life of peace, mostly keeping to themselves and occasionally wandering to a nearby town. They could only travel during the night, because, as legend goes, a troll's body will turn to stone when exposed to sunlight.\nGrimnir and Yrsa had a fondness for the treasures of humans. They would sneak into the town under the cover of darkness to collect shiny objects, food, and sometimes livestock, which they found fascinating. The townspeople had heard tales of the trolls and their nocturnal visits, but the creatures were so stealthy that they had never been caught in the act.\nOne cold, clear night, Grimnir and Yrsa descended from their mountain home to the town. As they prowled through the quiet streets, Yrsa's eye was caught by an ornate silver mirror displayed in a shop window. Entranced by its beauty, she reached out to take it, but in doing so, she stepped into a patch of moonlight, casting a large shadow that caught the attention of the town's watchman.\nStartled awake, the watchman raised the alarm. The villagers quickly rallied, grabbing torches and weapons. Grimnir, realizing they had been spotted, urged Yrsa to retreat to the safety of the mountains. While Grimnir, swift and agile, managed to escape, Yrsa was not as lucky. The villagers, emboldened by their numbers and the rare opportunity to confront the legendary trolls, pursued her into the mountainous terrain.\nYrsa, hindered by the steep and rocky landscape, stumbled and fell near the base of a towering peak. The villagers surrounded her, using thick ropes and chains to bind her to the ground.\nGrimnir, having safely reached the depths of the mountains, waited anxiously in the darkness. He could not risk exposing himself to the sunlight, but he felt a deep, growing dread as he sensed the unfolding events. With dawn breaking, a faint gleam of light through the rocks told him that the sun had risen. Grimnir knew what this meant for Yrsa, though he could not witness it himself. He felt the shift in the world as Yrsa, caught in the sun's rays, let out a mournful cry that echoed through the highlands. Her voice suddenly silenced, and he knew her fate.\nGrimnir's heart shattered, consumed by an overwhelming grief and a fiery rage. As night fell once more, he emerged from the mountains, his mind set on revenge. Descending upon the villagers with a fury unmatched, he unleashed his wrath on the unsuspecting town. The villagers, caught off guard, were powerless against his might. In a devastating rampage, Grimnir destroyed everything in his path, leaving no one alive. The town was reduced to ruins, a grim testament to the tragic tale that had unfolded.\nWith his vengeance complete, Grimnir returned to the mountains, his rage dissipating into profound sorrow. He sought out the spot where Yrsa had been turned to stone. There, at the base of the mountain, stood the petrified form of his beloved, her expression frozen in a mix of fear and sadness. Grimnir approached her, his hand gently touching the cold stone that had once been warm and full of life.\nAs dawn began to break again, Grimnir knew his time was near. He sat beside Yrsa, looking out over the landscape one last time. The first rays of sunlight touched him, and he felt a strange peace settle over his heart. Slowly, he too began to turn to stone, his body becoming as still and cold as the mountain around him. Side by side, the two trolls stood, transformed into eternal stone figures, becoming one with the harsh and rugged landscape.\nWhen the sun rose higher in the sky, casting menacing shadows across the ground, a raven, black as midnight, flew down from the sky. It circled above the stone figures for a moment, as if inspecting this new addition to the mountain's scenery. With a gentle flutter, the raven landed on top of Grimnir's stony head. It remained perched there for a bit, a solitary sentinel, as if paying tribute to the trolls' final act of defiance and love.\nEpisode II\nSparkling Night\nSomewhere in Iceland there was a small village, nestled between rugged hills and ancient forests. And in that small village there lived a small but curious boy named Oskar. He was known for sneaking out during the evening or at night, exploring the wilderness beyond the safety of his home. One day, as the late afternoon sun dipped low and shadows ran across the forest floor, Oskar followed the gentle sound of a nearby river stream. The water sparkled under the fading light as it wound through the trees, leading him to a secluded clearing. The air here felt different, lighter, almost humming with energy. He stood still, taking in the peaceful scene, but then suddenly... from the shadows of the surrounding trees, figures started to emerge: tall, graceful beings with pale skin and golden hair. Each one carried a silver plate filled with delicacies: cakes that glistened with sugar, berries that seemed to glow from within, and goblets filled with a shimmering, golden liquid.\nOskar hesitated, remembering the stories his elders had told him. He knew the dangers of accepting gifts from the Hidden People, he had heard all the tales of people who had been lured by them and were never heard from again. But the food smelled so sweet and their voices were so soothing. As they presented their offerings and assured him everything would be alright, he found himself unable to resist. Despite his better judgment, he reached out and took a piece of cake, biting into it. It was more delicious than anything he had ever tasted.\nAs soon as he swallowed, a deep, drowsy feeling came over him. The Hidden Peoples' laughter echoed around him and the forest seemed to spin and blur. They continued to offer him more, but with each bite, Oskar felt a part of himself slipping away. He started feeling like a passenger in his own body, idly watching as his hands moved against his will, filling his mouth with more and more food. The sweet taste turned bitter as an overpowering weariness settled over him, his vision blurred and slowly the world around him began to fade...\nHours later, or so it seemed, he awoke alone in the forest. The people had vanished and the clearing was empty, except for the remnants of the feast. Feeling strange and disoriented, Oskar hurried back to his village. But as he approached, nothing looked familiar. The houses looked uncanny, the paths were overgrown and even the trees were different, they seemed somehow... larger? Oskar, feeling increasingly disoriented, ran through the now-unfamiliar village. Panic gripped him as he approached what should have been his home. He burst through the door, calling for his mother and father, but the house was empty, cold, and silent. Confused and frightened, Oskar stumbled back outside, searching for any sign of his parents.\nAs he wandered into the garden, he stopped abruptly, his heart sinking. Before him stood three weathered tombstones. His breath caught in his throat as he read the inscription on the small one in the center:\n\"Oskar. Our beloved boy who never returned. May God rest your soul.\"\nEpisode III\nWild Water: Spirits of the Geyser\nBeneath the moss-covered hills, in an unnamed valley, a hidden world churned with fire and water. Deep underground, veins of molten rock heated the earth, creating unseen rivers that flowed with scalding heat. It was a place where nature breathed, exhaling steam from the land in bursts of fury, it was where the geysers lived.\nOne such geyser, known as Eldstrokur, had a life of its own. For centuries, it had been a guardian of the land, although its eruptions were both feared and revered. Villagers spoke of it in hushed tone, telling tales of how the geyser's eruptions were not random but a form of comunication, sort of a message from the earth. According to legends of old, the geyser often whispered to those who passed by it, offering them advice and solace during difficult times, and people had begun to accept and respect its wisdom, as if it were something of an oracle, deeply connected to the land itself. It was evident that a profound intelligence was at work, albeit beyond human comprehension.\nOne autumn morning, as the cold winds began to whisper over the plains, something strange occurred. Eldstrokur, normally predictable in its violent release of steam and water, had grown silent. The usual rumble beneath the surface was absent, replaced by an eerie stillness.\nA young woman named Runa, who had grown up hearing the legends, felt a pull to visit the geyser. Ever since it grew silent, she had felt a deep and hollow emptiness within her. She trekked across the rocky terrain, her breath visible in the crisp, cool air, and approached the ancient site. As she stood before the silent crater, a deep, resonant hum began to rise from the earth. She could almost make out voices emerging from the depths below, deep, calm and majestic. It sounded like chanting or singing, almost like a religious hymn or a psalm.\nSuddenly, the ground shook. Eldstrokur erupted with more force than ever before, sending a plume of water and steam high into the sky. But instead of receding back into silence, the geyser spoke through its roar. Runa watched, transfixed, as the mist formed shapes—figures that danced and swirled in the air. They were ancient spirits, guardians of the land, who had been dormant for centuries.\nBut the figures weren't wild or menacing. As they danced in the mist, their shapes grew clearer, becoming almost human. They moved with a graceful, fluid energy, beckoning to Runa with outstretched hands. There was no fear in her heart, only a strange sense of longing, belonging and kinship: as if these ancient beings were calling her to something she had always known but had forgotten. She felt something awaken inside her, something that had always been there, yet had never found its way into her consciousness.\nThe geyser's roar became a melody, a deep, resonant hum that filled the air, and in it, Runa heard voices—not harsh or commanding, but soft, almost inviting. The figures called her name, their eyes shining with a light that seemed to pierce through time.\n\"Join us,\" they whispered, their voices carried on the steam and wind. \"You belong with us, Runa. The earth, the fire, the water—they are part of you, as you are part of them.\" Although she didn't understand, she knew that what they were saying was true, in a way she had always known.\nWithout hesitation, Runa stepped closer to the edge of Eldstrokur. The heat from the geyser was intense, but it no longer burned. Instead, it felt welcoming, like a warm embrace. The figures continued to call, their voices growing louder, and in that moment, Runa understood that this was where she was meant to be.\nShe took one final step and leaped into the heart of the geyser.\nThe steam enveloped her, and for a brief moment, there was only silence. But Runa felt no fear and no pain, only a profound sense of belonging. She became part of the mist, the water, the ancient power that surged beneath the earth. The figures surrounded her, their forms dissolving into light, and together, they vanished into the gloomy depths below...\nEldstrokur erupted once more, higher and stronger than ever before, as if welcoming its newest guardian. The land was quiet again, but those who passed by in the years to come would tell stories of the woman who had been called by the geyser - who had become one with the earth itself.\nEpisode IV\nFire Heart\nBeneath one of Iceland's most active volcanoes, a small village had thrived for generations, nestled close to the steaming vents and the ever shifting ground. Here, the people had learned to live with the land's volatility, adapting to its steady tremors and occasional eruptions. Their saying, passed down from one generation to the next, was simple but fitting: The land gives what it will and claims what it will.\nArnar, a geologist born in the village, had always been captivated by the secrets locked beneath the earth's surface. Raised on legends of Iceland's fiery heart, he became consumed with an insatiable need to understand the mountain's secrets. The volcano drew him in, its unpredictable fury a puzzle he was determined to unravel, even if it meant standing at the edge of death itself.\nBut the mountain was not all that had captivated his heart and soul. Arnar had also fallen in love with Freyja, a farmer with deep ties to the land. She was grounded, practical, and resilient - the perfect counterbalance to his restless curiosity. They married and built a modest home on the village's edge, dreaming of a future where they might raise a family, undisturbed by the mountain's looming presence.\nOne summer, the volcano began to stir ominously. Arnar watched in horror as the seismic readings confirmed his worst fears: the earth was preparing for a major eruption, one that would devastate everything in its path. Racing back to the village, he gathered the people and urged them to leave, but many were reluctant. Generations had lived and died on this land, and abandoning it felt like abandoning a part of themselves.\nAs dawn approached, Freyja found him, her face etched with worry. \"I believe you, Arnar,\" she said softly, \"but my family can't imagine abandoning the land. They don't believe it's as dangerous as you say, and they won't leave—even if I try to convince them.\"\nArnar's heart twisted. He knew he could never force Freyja or her family to abandon their home, but he couldn't bear the thought of losing them.\nDesperate, he devised a final, daring plan. He knew of a fault line on the volcano's slope where a controlled explosion might divert the lava flow away from the village, channeling it safely into an empty valley. It was risky - an almost impossible task - but it was the only way to protect his people and the woman he loved.\nWith only hours left, Arnar and a few brave villagers climbed the mountain, carrying the explosives he had prepared. Ash rained down as they approached the fault line, the ground trembling beneath their feet. Arnar worked quickly, setting the charges with precision. He told the others to run, but as the mountain rumbled, he realized the ground was shifting faster than he'd calculated. The explosion would need to be triggered manually to divert the flow in time.\nKnowing what this meant, Arnar lit the fuse and braced himself, watching as the others retreated down the slope. The explosives detonated with a deafening roar, and the ground beneath him trembled violently. The lava began to flow, diverted just as he'd planned, away from the village and into the valley.\nAs the molten river surged past, Arnar felt a rush of heat engulf him. He stayed rooted to the spot, watching the redirected lava with a mix of relief and acceptance. In his final moments, he thought of Freyja, imagining her safe in the village below. And then, the fire took him, consuming him in an instant.\nEpisode V\nJust a Dream\nThe city was perfect, almost impossibly so. Elva wandered through its pristine streets while her footsteps echoed against the polished stone. The air was quite heavy, faintly scented with rain and pinewood, though no clouds were visible in the pale and gray skies above, and not a single tree was in sight. Every surface here was gleaming, as if freshly washed, but there was no sound, no wind, and no sign of life.\nShe took a turn onto a narrow street. The houses along the street were smooth and windowless. The air was silent and her footsteps were the only sound she could hear. The road curved and twisted until it opened onto a wide but empty plaza with concentric stone benches circling a single structure: a tall clock tower. The face of the tower was blank and its hands were slowly moving, ticking away slowly. Something about it tugged at her, a feeling she couldn't quite shake.\nDespite this, Elva didn't linger. She walked down another street. This one sloped downwards and lead into a tunnel carved through a solid wall. The air grew damp down there, and her breathing was getting louder against the tunnel's silence. She quickened her pace until she saw light ahead and walked back into the open air, relieved, as a faint gust of wind gently ran across her face.\nThe clock tower loomed before her once again, impossibly tall and menacing. She noticed that the hands on the clock had stopped moving and the clock was stuck at 12 o'clock.\nHer pulse quickened as she stared up at the tower. How did she end up here again? It seemed impossible. She turned abruptly, choosing another street without hesitation. This street went in a straight line, leading away from the plaza. It felt endless, the buildings growing taller, the air stifling, and she could feel the wind change. She walked faster and faster, glancing back once more to see only darkness swallowing the way she had come, as if she had come from nowhere at all.\nThe street suddenly twisted sharply at a ninety-degree angle, and she stepped into the same plaza she had just left moments before.\nElva's breath hitched as she began to turn in circles, scanning the streets leading out of the square, certain she had walked far enough to be somewhere else. Her chest tightened as fear crept in, it was as though an invisible weight pressed down on her chest with every breath she took.\n— Panic.\nThe clock tower loomed above her and its shadow stretched like a blade across the plaza. She noticed that at its base, faint words were etched into the stone: \"Why did you forget?\" Her stomach twisted and she backed away, her mind racing, until her eyes caught something new: a small, plain red door at the base of the clock tower. She could have sworn that it hadn't been there before, yet there it was.\nElva hesitated and her hands began to tremble. The door felt eerie, heavy with an unseen weight, but it called to her somehow, and it had a strange hint of familiarity to it. Slowly, she stepped towards it, her feet dragging as if the air resisted her.\nThe handle felt cold against her fingers and when she pulled, the door wouldn't move at all. She noticed that beside the door was a small bucket of paint and a brush. The paint bucket read \"Paint it black\". She immediately opened the bucket and painted the door black with broad and coarse strokes of the old, weathered brush.\nShe then attempted to open the door once more. This time, the door opened to darkness.\n— She stepped through.\nThe air grew heavy and the ground shifted beneath her. The city had vanished, replaced by a room that felt both foreign and familiar at the same time. Its walls were lined with photographs, hundreds and hundreds of them scattered all over the walls in chaotic ensemble. Each frame held a frozen moment from her own life — her childhood home, her parents' smiles, the last argument she'd had with someone she used to love.., there were way too many to count, and she began to feel overwhelmed.\nThe images were vivid, yet somehow they seemed warped — the smiles on people's faces were stretched too wide, their eyes too sharp, their features too exaggerated somehow. Although all of these memories were undoubtedly her own, they felt uncanny, as if they belonged to someone else. As if someone else had lived them. As she took in the scenes from each frame, forgotten memories, buried feelings, and long-lost thoughts surged back into her consciousness, immersing her completely, as though she were living them all over again.\nShe turned her face away from the photographs and looked around. At the center of the room there stood a mirror, its surface shimmering like water. Elva stepped closer, her reflection staring back at her with an intensity that made her pause in her tracks. \"What is this place?\" she whispered. Her reflection smiled and locked eyes with her sharply, she could feel them pierce her mind — then a cold, hollow grin, and her reflection looked away for a brief moment. \"You know,\" it said. Its voice echoed her own but it was deeper and heavier.\nMemories surged through her mind: a fight, a terrible decision, a car crash. She saw herself walking away, leaving someone behind, carrying the weight of guilt she had tried so hard to forget. The mirror darkened, and her reflection's eyes burned like fiery embers. \"You built this city to hide from yourself,\" said the reflection. \"But you can't stay here forever, you know.\"\nShe looked back at the photographs on the walls, only this time they felt closer, more real, more her own, not uncanny but familiar and present. Among the photographs, she saw faces she recognized: Grimnir, her childhood friend, his face twisted in pain as she ran away during a fight that had left him bruised and bleeding; Yrsa, the neighbor she had refused to help during a harsh winter, her warm smile replaced with tears in the memory; Oskar, her mischievous cousin, whom she had blamed for her own mistake, watching as he took the punishment without complaint; Runa, her wise teacher, whom she had abandoned in her final moments of need, ignoring the older woman's cries for help in a storm; and Arnar, the boy who had once asked for her forgiveness, his outstretched hand left hanging as she walked away. Each memory came rushing back, their voices filled with pain, their eyes pleading with her. They weren't just pictures now but fragments of her guilt, pieces of herself she had tried to bury, and the weight of it all threatened to crush her .Tears streamed down her face as the room began to crumble. The photographs burned, the mirror cracked, and the darkness closed in. Elva screamed, reaching out, but there was nothing to hold onto. \"Now you know\", she heard the voice whisper once more.\nShe woke abruptly, gasping for air. Her room was dimly lit and the hum of the real world slowly began to return to her ears. But as she sat up, she felt a strange weight pulling her down, as if she was carrying something heavy. The clock in her room ticked softly, she lay back down and listened to it for a few minutes and then heard it stop abruptly. Looking up she saw that the clock read exactly 12 hours. As the clock stopped, she felt no more guilt, no more remorse or regret, as if a heavy weight had been lifted off her. She sat back up again. Across the room, her reflection in the mirror stared back, its lips moving silently. Elva didn't need to hear the words. She already knew:\n\"It was just a dream.\"",

            "about": "\"Lauda Sion\" is a sequence prescribed for the Roman Catholic Mass for the feast of Corpus Christi. It was written by St. Thomas Aquinas around 1264, at the request of Pope Urban IV for the new Mass of this feast, along with Pange lingua, Sacris solemniis, and Verbum supernum prodiens, which are used in the Divine Office.\nThe Gregorian melody of the Lauda Sion is borrowed from the eleventh-century sequence Laetabundi iubilemus attributed to Adam of Saint Victor.\nThe hymn tells of the institution of the Eucharist and clearly expresses the belief of the Roman Catholic Church in transubstantiation and in Real presence, that is, that the bread and wine truly become permanently and irreversibly the Body and Blood of Christ when consecrated by a validly-ordained priest or bishop during the Mass.\nLauda Sion is one of only four medieval sequences which were preserved in the Roman Missal published in 1570 following the Council of Trent (1545–1563) by Will of Saint Pius V—the others being Victimae paschali laudes (Easter), Veni Sancte Spiritus (Pentecost), and Dies irae (requiem masses). (A fifth, Stabat Mater, would later be added in 1727.) Before Trent, many feasts had their own sequences.\nThe existing versions were unified in the Roman Missal promulgated in 1570.\nThe Lauda Sion is still sung today as a solemn Eucharistic hymn, though its use as a sequence is optional in the Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite. Before the reform of 1970, it was sung on Corpus Christi as a sequence between the gradual Oculi omnium and the Gospel of the day, after the verse of the Alleluia.",

For those who are new to my music, this is a glimpse into my beginnings as an ambient artist and one of a select number of releases from the past which I will be reissuing here. I thank you, as always for your support and for making my music a part of your lives. in a world where there are so many choices, I am humbled that you would choose my audio excursions as sonic companions on your life's journey. I appreciate all of you greatly.",

            "about": "When d york approached me about sampling some Nutcracker toy soldier music box like recordings he had made, I was immediately inspired to do something with them. The no longer available piece called \"Silent Night, Shepherds Quake\" by archive was the impetus for me to explore just how to mangle these recordings.\nI ran them through some reaktor and molecular effects, sent them back to David who then reimagined them through Bitwig and other modular synthesis tools.\nUpon hearing the new versions, I reimagined one of them a second time to which he applied even more effects and we both agreed that this re-re-reimagined track would be the perfect way to end the album you're about to hear.\"",

            "about": "Included in Kathy's list of favorites for 2018:  mainlypiano.com/favorites/kathys-favorites-2018\nwhen searching for meaning in suffering, when trying to process the unfathomable and you discover that there are more questions than answers, that is when\nyou hear the quiet whispering of strength that is often drowned out by the unrelenting noise of the world.\nThis album is dedicated to my brother Joe and his family who I hold dearly in my heart as they go through the trials and tribulations of the disease of stage 4 cancer which he has contracted. It has metastasized from a spot on the kidney to the lungs, lymph nodes and adrenal gland. His wife was also diagnosed with breast cancer and will be starting radiation treatment shortly.\nThey have a 6-year-old little girl who is very precious and who I have become quite fond of.\nThe inspiration for this album came from conversations between Joe's wife and I about the book of job that we would have late into the night as I recently visited the family.\nThank you very much from me and my family for your support, your prayers and your thoughts of comfort during this time.\n\"Scott Lawlor is an artist in more than one sense of the word, he is a creator of music that touches the soul, and he is also an artist who paints with music in such a way, that it reflects exactly on this condition we all have called, humanity. The vastness of the soundscapes that Lawlor brings into our realm are without parallel, and now we can journey together, through yet another realm of inner dimensional music, via the project called Look Unto the Heavens.\nSo let’s enter the portal and embrace the tones, our first experience is called, Clothe Me With Skin and Flesh and Knit Me Together With Bones and Sinews. You will find that most of the titles, like the tracks are long form, but this ultra-descriptive narrative is exactly what we need. This offering is some of the finest ambient styled work I have heard since Eno; we can allow our imagination to see humanity in creation mode through this simply wonderful fluid composition.\nI have listened too much of Scott Lawlor’s work, and with each listen I become an even bigger fan, so let’s stay in the flow with the next piece called, The shady trees cover him with their shadow. This is one of my personal favourites from the release, I have a love for the ambient genre and Scott Lawlor brings so much to it, but on this 12 minute plus opus he generates a whole new realm to explore, so let’s close our eyes and let our powers of visualization come to the fore. This is paced so well and created with so much thought, that we can with ease be the watcher within the forest, and the guardian of this musical glade.\nScott Lawlor’s talent is sublime in manifesting quality soundscapes, and within the offering called, And behold the clouds which are higher than thou, we have a real and tangible chance to sample the lighter energy of Lawlor’s artistry. This is just about perfect with regard to the subject matter and Lawlor’s gentle but careful hand on the keyboards and synths create a resonance so peaceful and light to float upon.\nEach track seamlessly moves into each other, and creates a backdrop so enticing that at each corner, we’re never quite sure what to expect next. On the piece entitled, For he wounds, but he binds up, that reality is explored in far more depth. There is a deeper and a more sombre mood to this construction, but also one that, so very carefully begins to grow with a distant positive intensity.\nWe now float with serenity into the following composition called, He shatters, but his hands heal. This merges so well with the previous track and musically this is an opportunity to watch perhaps a rebirth. To grow again we must let go, so we can shatter from what we once were and then transform into something much more. Lawlor’s attention to detail here is quite breath-taking, especially around the 5 minute mark, where there is a distinct elevation in energy, perhaps as the one constant in the universe takes place, change!\nAnd our days on earth are but a shadow, this is our musical footpath to explore, for those of us who realise that our short time on the face of this planet is fleeting, this has to be the anthem for that belief. Lawlor’s skills here are supreme in creating a new landscape, perhaps a hillside, where we can watch the shadows crawl across a scenic vista, and know that despite all of our desires and hopes, we are but a shadow of futures past and present. Scott Lawlor in this one incredible piece has manifested pure music for thought and contemplation through honesty.\nApart from being easily the longest title I have ever written about or even seen, For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease, is one of the most beautiful ambient slices of music I have merged with for some time. Eno used to like to create space between music, so much so, that the space was just as important as the music itself. Lawlor here has done something similar, the piece seems to ebb and flow, like the encroaching sea line on the coast of the western ocean, but never loses its cohesion. The long notes are as equally important as the narrative that is drawn by the music, one of hope, one of life. Once more after the half way point, you will hear a smooth, but slight elevation in power, and this will give you exactly the same sensation as seeing a ray of sunlight break through the clouds on a dismal cloudy day.\nThe mood on this next piece is akin to a new dawn and is called, Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning. This is perhaps a composition of perspective. Life does indeed change constantly, but the perception that life can be altered for the good, by acceptance of actual change. This in my view is one of the cleverest pieces off the album, one that shines shards of light into a dark room, and creates sparkling images of musical possibilities along the way; here is a piece that seems to constantly reinvent itself, as it unfurls itself into our reality.\nAnd those who mourn are lifted to safety, is our penultimate offering, Scott Lawlor allows us to breathe on this piece, and no matter what trauma we encounter, at some stage we will be lifted and raised from our sorrow. This is a truly cathartic arrangement from Lawlor and again one that offers hope along the highways of life’s rich and sometimes confusing patterns.\nYou will find something quite outstanding awaiting you at the end of the album, as track 10 delivers a 4 part opus of grandeur, one so in-depth and so well performed. This is the title of the entire concept, and of course called Look unto the Heavens. Here Lawlor explores the inner realms of what some describe as heaven, and with each and every brush stroke of ambient brilliance; he manifests a musical reality that one could totally be at peace and harmony with. We can drift seamlessly through one island of utter harmonic bliss and then be raised in a stunning vibrational energy, through the simplest of choral harmonies, into another. Lawlor’s creation expresses itself with an arrangement that best describes infinity and brings into reality a place in music, where we become the watchers of time and tide.\nScott Lawlor will always remember this album; it’s a benefit release to help his brother who is suffering from Cancer. He will be proud of this creation; he has manifested something here that is special and deeply peaceful. Look unto the Heavens is an album of sanctuary, a place that he has musically created that is free from pain, a sojourn for his brother, a respite for all who need to stop and breathe and an album of some of the best ambient music I have heard for many years, this healing journey of a release must be saluted for its incredible self-expression, and we all hope that Scott’s brother enjoys his moments in the realm of this album and receives all the love, light and healing he can get from it.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio\n\"Look Unto the Heavens is the first of a three-part series of albums composed and released by Scott Lawlor between mid-2017 through May 2018. The series is dedicated to Scott’s brother, Joe, who was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer that had metastasized and later took his life. Look Unto the Heavens is two hours and twenty-two minutes of soothing ambient music that suggests the enveloping peace of the heavens while trying to make sense of this horrifying disease here on earth. Lawlor explains it this way: “when searching for meaning in suffering, when trying to process the unfathomable and you discover that there are more questions than answers, that is when you hear the quiet whispering of strength that is often drowned out by the unrelenting noise of the world.” Lawlor goes on to say that the inspiration for this album came from late night conversations with Joe’s wife about the book of Job during a visit with the family shortly before composing the album.\nThe ten tracks flow together seamlessly to create a very tranquil atmosphere over the full length of the album. There are subtle variations within each track, but they are mostly ambient sounds layered with occasional instrumental phrasings. While there are feelings of vast space in the music, this doesn’t feel like “space music” to me, as that often feels kind of lost, dark and even frightening. This music is dark, but much of it expresses of warmth, comfort and even reassurance.\nThe individual tracks range from a bit over six minutes to over an hour, and each has a descriptive title. Read consecutively, they form an interesting message: “Clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews. The shady trees cover him with their shadow and behold the clouds which are higher than thou. For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal, and our days on earth are but a shadow. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease. Life will be brighter than noonday, and darkness will become like morning, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.” The last track, which runs for more than an hour is the title track of the album.\nLook Unto the Heavens is a profound ambient musical work by one of its masters, Scott Lawlor.\"\nReview by Kathy Parsons of  mainlypiano.com",

            "about": "\"“Strong gravity slows time,” Sam explained.\n“In fact, for my right hand, time would pass at half the rate of my left.\nIf you had a time-lapse camera and watched these hands for years, you would see my left begin to wrinkle and discolor while my right barely aged.\nThat is gravity’s effect on time.\"\nA.G. Riddle, Lost in Time\nIngrid N:\n\"I processed my live played gongs so that sometimes only an extreme\nvibration signal remained.\nThis gave me a feeling of complete freedom on my musical journey. And\nthe gongs could be seen from a new perspective.\nThey offer so many unusual sound possibilities.\nScott and I could not foresee where this sound experiment would take us But I am convinced that in all music the essence of the soul that created it becomes visible.\"\nAfter listening to these more experimental gong improvisations which Ingrid sent me, I decided to be as equally experimental in contributing to them.\nTwo compositions by Morton Feldman informed my choices of instrumentation and direction for the improvising, Rothko Chapel (1971) and for Philip Guston (1984).",

            "about": "This album was originally published on the Slithering Black Records label in March of 2024 so if you purchased it from there, no need to repurchase it from my personal page.\n\"In the desolate alleys of an abandoned city, whispers of dread echo among the decaying buildings. A malevolent outbreak has engulfed the once vibrant streets, spreading like a sinister shroud suffocating hope. Shadows dance with sinister glee as twisted figures lurk in the darkness, their eyes gleaming with malice. The air is thick with the stench of decay, mingling with the agonized wails of those consumed by the virulent plague.\"",

            "about": "This album was originally published on the Slithering Black Records label in July of 2023, so if you purchased it from there, please don't buy it again. I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nAn alien civilization far from our own. A creation process is finishing the last steps. The final bits of data are being transferred into the organism. Moving away from the machines, you fly over the piles and piles of rejected clones. Some are still aware of their condition. They call out for mercy.\nAt the Analysis Center, new organisms are reviewed to see which ones will be selected to proceed. The creator reviews each and revels in the beauty of each, yet misses a slight flaw. Blood begins to flow within the newly created being and it will soon be added to the millions of inhabitants of the station.\nSoon after being introduced into the civilization, the imperfection takes control. The organism turns against society and begins ripping it apart. Yet in its mind, it has found its purpose. It has found bliss. The defect takes over the organism and the system slowly shut down until consciousness fades away.\nFrom Slithering Black Records:\n\"Manufacturing Defects is a testament to the power of collaboration and the ability of sound to plunge the human psyche into unexplored depths. It is a journey that challenges perceptions, blurring the line between reality and nightmare. Lawlor and Insectarium's masterful manipulation of sonic textures weaves a narrative of desolation and malevolence that captivates the senses, leaving an indelible mark on the soul.\"",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nThe concept of fearing breasts may seem strange in a country when the media and culture frequently accentuate them. But for some, this anxiety is a real, upsetting reality known as mastrophobia. This phobia is characterized by an extreme fear of breasts, which can seriously affect daily comfort and interpersonal connections.\nThe phobia can complicate personal relationships, social interactions, and even activities like going to the beach or watching movies. The impact can be as strange as the phobia itself.\nIn some cultures, breasts are highly sexualized or considered taboo, which can contribute to developing a fear of them.",

            "about": "In November of 2015, my wife had surgery on her heel to remove a bone spur that had been there for the past 21 years or so. She was on some pain medication and I kept track of when she would need subsequent doses.\nThis long-form ambient track was based on a time interval and since I'm using a timer to measure when she needs to take her meds, I figured, why not put the time to another artistic use by creating a drone? She is always saying that I make my drones by putting a brick on the keys so I used the eventide space pedal and resting it on some black keys to create the main portion of the drone, I had an effect set up with one of the knobs that I turned every so often while simultaneously playing random notes along the way to help the drone evolve.",

            "about": "This album was inspired by mike Benoit's \"The Spore collection\" which you can find here.\nmikebenoit.bandcamp.com/album/the-spore-collection\nI created a 30 minute dark drone and sent it to a number of collaborators who all added their sonic magic to the original track.\nAs a result, you'll be hearing a wide variety of moods, timbres and different expressions of collaborative efforts that are simply amazing.\nI'd like to thank everyone who took part in this project. Their contributions are what really made this a very special and unique release. Please check out their web presences, listed in the credits.",

            "about": "2016: for a lot of people it was a very difficult and tumultuous 12 months.\nAs a country, we experienced police brutality, domestic terrorism, the most divisive election cycle in modern history,, the cold calculated murder of police officers, the loss of a great number of artists who have changed history and had a very positive impact on our culture and humanity and to top off what an unbelievable year this has been, the unlikely, astonishing and very disappointing election of a reality television personality as well as a bankrupt narcissist to the office of president of the United States.\nMany people have been counting down the days until 2016 is over and so, to that end, I present, on the last day of this year, a requiem for 2016, a dark menacing 74 minute soundscape which I believe communicates the emotions that a lot of us felt as a result of the cultural and political upheaval we have been unwilling witness to.",

            "about": "These tracks were written between July 26 and August 23, 2023 and were responses to various Naviar Haiku challenges over that time.\nThis is also my last album composed in Texas where my lovely wife and I, along with our children, have made our home for the last 20 years.\nI think the title Morning Solace fits the concept, as it's the beginning of a new life for all of us going forward.\nMorning Solace was inspired by naviar haiku 500\nLull in the Rain was inspired by naviar haiku 501\nCumulus Clouds was inspired by naviar haiku 499\nMetamorphosis was inspired by naviar haiku 503\nLong Days and Warm Nights was inspired by naviar haiku 498\nEveryone Gone was inspired by naviar haiku 502",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nNecrophilia is a term for the sexual attraction to corpses. Psychologists cite that in 68% of cases, the most common motive for necrophiliacs is a desire\nto control a partner who does not resist. It is classified as a paraphilia by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association.\nNecrophilia is believed to be rare. Even where it exists, it is most often carried out in the form of fantasy or role-playing.\nThere are three primary forms of necrophilia:\n• Necrophilic homicide, when the necrophiliac kills someone to obtain a corpse for sex;\n• Regular necrophilia, when the necrophiliac has sex with corpses that weren't murdered by the necrophiliac;\n• Necrophilic fantasy, when the necrophiliac simply fantasizes about sex with corpses and never acts on the fantasies.\nAccording to psychologists, there are other motives including the wish to be with a now-deceased partner (21%), attraction to corpses (15%), feeling isolated\nand in need of connection (15%), and the need to exercise power over a victim (12%).",

            "about": "\"This release was inspired by Gustav Holst's \"Neptune, the Mystic\" from his suite \"The Planets\", as well as by the planet for which the piece was composed.\nI have always been fascinated by this, the outermost planet in our solar system and so felt the desire to compose my own music to bring the listener on an imaginative journey to Neptune: the mystical blue world.\"\nFrom Hypnagogue Music Reviews\nSpacemusic fans, please queue up in an orderly fashion to procure tickets for the voyage that is Scott Lawlor’s Neptune. Inspired by the distant planet\nand Holst’s classical paean to it on The Planets, Lawlor grabs hold of familiar spacemusic tropes, wraps them in drones, and gives his listeners a deep\nand image-filled ride. This is familiar territory, done well. The rushes of stellar wind are here, the choirs of celestial voice pads, the sense of passing\nthrough the vast stellar distances—all intact and used properly. Lawlor laces in a recurring motif of icy temple-bell chimes and marks passage with them\nvery conservatively. When they ring out against his layered pads and drones, it’s a beautifully sharp call that really works. There’s a great trade off\nbetween stretches with softly administered melodic passages and those that just whisper and drone. The opening track, “The Mystical Blue World,” is the\nformer. After setting us adrift, Lawlor lays in a slow-moving phrase that sounds just familiar enough to make me expect David Gilmour to slip in and fire\noff a riff. “Neptune’s Rings” goes the other way. Opening with scale-ascending bell chimes, it slowly melts into a lush, windy drift. Lawlor really lets\nhis pads stretch to the far reaches here, and it’ll take conscious thought with it. Between this and its followup, “The Great Ocean,” we’re afforded over\nhalf an hour of the deepest material on the release. “…Ocean” makes up 20 of those minutes. It’s packed with drones that take their time rising up in intensity,\nand everything is underscored with a persistent whoosh that is equal parts wind and the far-off sound of the ocean. He manages to convey and excellent\nsense of drama throughout this piece, and really holds the listener’s attention for 20 minutes. “Wizard’s Eye” sounds reasonably similar, but arcs upward\ntoward the end into higher-register pads. Here I find myself hearkening back to the lighter parts of Roach’s Magnificent Void. Overall, this is a disc\nthat demands long-term looping.\nStepping into a genre that’s as trope-heavy and well-trodden as spacemusic can be a tricky proposition for an artist. There’s not a lot of new ground,\nso what you lay down needs to have a certain something that hooks the listener in. I can say that Neptune has such a hook. Have you heard it before? Sure,\na bit. But if you love good spacemusic, this album follows the rules and lays out the sonic sights you love, and it does so very, very well. I like Lawlor’s\npatience in the way he layers his pads. There’s no hurry and, unlike a lot of spacemusic, there’s no need to build to some big celestial moment—you know,\nthe ever-present supernova sound that births out into a big helping of choral pads. That’s not what this is; what this is is a spacey voyage you’ll take\nmany times, finding yourself in the musical moment at different stages, always discovering a fresh side of it. Set aside the time, bust out the headphones,\nand head out, space cowboy.",

            "about": "lyrics for Footprints Scar the Snowflakes:\nIt swallows the light\nstretched out beyond the heaven’s reach\nConstricting the radiance of all matter\nAll is shadow\nLife decays from the death of the Sun\nPitch black\nNothing can no longer be seen\nWith all living things blinded by the absence of the daylight we once knew\nOur new world\nOur dark world\nAll now resides in gloom.\n\"You would never take a rose from a beast.\nIf his callous hand were to hold out a scarlet flower, his grip unaffected by pricking thorns, you would shrink from the gift and refuse it. I know that is what you would do.\nBut the cunning beast will have his beauty.\nHe hunts not in hopeless pursuit, for fear would have you sprint all the day long. Thus, he turns toward the shadows and clutches the rosebud, crunching and twisting until every delicate petal is detached.\nOne falls not far from your feet, and you notice the red spot in the snow.\nThe color sparkles in the sunlight, catching your curious eye. No beast stands in sight; there is nothing to fear, so you dare retrieve the lone petal.\nThe touch of temptation is velvet against your thumb. It carries a scent you bring to your nose, and both eyes close to float on a cloud of perfume.\nAs your lashes lift, another scarlet drop stains the snow at a near distance. A glance around perceives no danger, and so your footprints scar the snowflakes to retrieve another rosy leaflet as soft and sweet as the first.\nYour eyes shine with flecks of golden greed at the discovery of more discarded petals, and you blame the wind for scattering them mere footprints apart. All you want is a few, so you step and snatch, step and snatch, step and snatch.\nSoon, there is enough velvet to rub against your cheek like a silken kerchief. Your collection of one-plus-one-more reeks of floral essence.\nDistracted, you jump at the sight of the beast in your path. He stands before his lair, grinning without love. His callous hands grip at thorns on a single naked stem, and you look down at your own hands that now cup his rose. But how can it be?\"",

            "about": "Halloween provides an opportunity to confront the multitude of fears which lurk in the subconscious mind, allowing us to acknowledged them through ritual which includes the social aspects of trick or treating and dressing up in costumes which represent physical manifestations of the very fears we attempt to demystify on this day.\nin reality, they live in the dark corners of our collective psyche, creating a multi-faceted dimension of the human experience, combining light and shadow which give all of us the complex personalities which make us unique and special.\nThe demystification of such fears, which have lurked in our subconscious minds for centuries, can turn old nightmares into new stories, a concept we have tried to capture in the album you are about to experience.",

These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. I try to vary the sound as much as the substance so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nOur hookers are making fun of this overly commercialized nonsensical day in the middle of February where candy stores, flower shops and card makers make profits off of the shallow sentimentality of the traditions of cupid and his stupid arrows.",

            "about": "Ambi had this to say about our collaboration.\n\"Scott Lawlor invited me to collaborate on his Nocturnes series.\nHe kindly sent his 7 drone-type tracks.\nWorking on the Nocturnes became quite an adventure for me.\nFirst I treated them with respect and some TLC.\nThen after a couple of times listening to a track I came up with ideas supplementing the track. Challenging me to think outside my regular comfort space. And started composing, playing and recording.\nAs extra challenge I used only softsyths and samplers, which I hadn't used for ages.\nGradually the album grew and now it's finished I must say I really like the final result.\"",

This is my second collaboration.\nI can honestly say it is very rewarding to work with others - especially someone as talented and experienced in the ambient realm as Scott.\nI took Scott's 7 Nocturne drone tracks and added recycled modular synth patches, Bitwig and MiniFreakV synth. We are both happy with the results and hope you like it too.\" 😊",

The self of man disappears,\nthe divine can take its place within him and a space is created in which something new and beautiful can be “forged”.",

            "about": "\"‘There are so many positions of love:\neach curve of a branch,\nthe thousand ways your eyes can hold us,\nthe infinite shapes each mind can draw,\nthe spring orchestra of scents and sounds wafting through the air,\nthe currents of light combusting like passionate lips,\nthe revolution of the universe’s skirts,\nwhose folds contain other worlds,\nour every sigh that falls against the inconceivably close,\nomnipresent divine body.\"\nHafiz\nIngrid N:\nGongs vibrate so intensely that they can reach the deepest parts of our body, as well as our soul.\nYou can explore this on your own body, so to speak, if you give yourself over completely to the sounds of the gong and immerse yourself in them.\nTo have a dialog with another musician who combines his world of sound with that of the gongs is something very special.\nUltimately, it leads me to the experience that we are all connected - especially through music - regardless of where we live and what language we speak.\nWe are brothers and sisters, we are human beings. A connection with gong sounds is a connection from heart to heart.\nGongs schwingen so intensiv, dass sie die tiefsten Stellen unseres Körpers erreichen können, ebenso unserer Seele.\nDas kann man sozusagen am eigenen Leib erforschen, wenn man sich Gongklängen ganz und gar anheim gibt, darin aufgeht.\nEinen Dialog zu führen mit einem weiteren Musiker, der seine Klangwelt mit denen der Gongs verbindet, ist etwas sehr besonderes.\nLetztlich führt es mich zu der Erfahrung, dass wir alle -insbesondere durch Musik - miteinander verbunden sind, unabhängig davon, wo wir leben und welche Sprache wir sprechen.\nWir sind Brüder und Schwestern , wir sind Menschen. Eine Verbindung durch Gong Klänge ist eine Verbindung von Herz zu Herz.",

He added briliant improvisations with a number of his analog synthesizers and the result is truly sublime and one that I hope you'll return to time and again.\nplease check out the complete compilation using the link in the credits and if you've purchased it already, pleas don't buy my track again. I upload things to my page that are submitted to other labels presuming that we both have different audiences.",

            "about": "The 9 tracks for this new solo piano album were improvised during the month of August 2017.\n\"Scott Lawlor has to be one of the most creative musicians around today, normally known for his long form synth work; Lawlor has gained the reputation for being one of the most prolific ambassadors of ambient electronic music this decade. However here on this latest release Open Arms, we are treated to a performance based on purely the piano; this collection of fine solo works starts with the artistic opener Open Arms part 1. There is something quite calming about this piece that I adored, I love the ambience that Lawlor creates, but here the tone seems elevated and with a certain lightness of spirit.\nLawlor is one of music's painters with tone, and on Dream of the Empath we see just why that is. This spacious opus of grandeur gives us ever eager listeners the opportunity to roam freely within the music, to perhaps discover what we may, perhaps like the empath picking up on emotions and feelings from others. There is a wonderful expression of suspense and a hovering attitude of potential possibility within the very structure of this extremely creative performance, one too easy to get lost within.\nThis has to be one of the most artistic musical collections I have heard for some time and Lawlor continues and excels further now with the piece Come Away With Me Into The Cool Twilight. The approach here is once more calming and tranquil, Lawlor has really worked hard here and crafted a piece that at times reminds me of music from the film Blade Runner, so an ambient Vangelis connection is created in what is truly a thoroughly deep, but soothing narrative of musical mastery.\nWaiting for One Day continues the ambience beyond anything you may have heard before, personally I really adore the solo piano work of Lawlor, it reminds me of the U.S ambient pianist Michael Harrison and that is certainly not a bad thing. To be honest music like this I could have on repeat for hours, it becomes part of your life without any interruptions and manifests a soothing atmospheric reality around you, one that you can be very productive within.\nTime to go long form now with the composition entitled Loves Reverie. One will detect a real mood of calmness and a pleasurable motif of happiness within this arrangement. The best thing of all is that we have exactly 12 minutes to enjoy this light and uplifting opus, but Lawlor has been clever here, whilst creating positivity in mood, the track never loses its ambient roots, and contains its spirit beautifully in a cohesive musical form.\nWe now move ever onward and enter into the deep pathways of this forest of beautiful music called Open Arms, and now come across something really colourful within this next composition called A Gentle Embrace. The fluency here reminds me in parts of US pianist Attila Gibson, especially the latter half of the arrangement which picks up energetically until its conclusion.\nThe longest offering on the album is this one, it's called My Tranquil Refuge, and at just shy of 13 minutes it's a wonderful moment of long form genius that I find personally fascinating. I have had some stressful times in my life and during these unwanted sojourns I used to immerse myself into the art work of painter Howard Hodgkin whilst listening to Eno. Now I have a track that can equally be my new refuge when times get tough, I can gaze into the afternoon haze and be a part of this incredibly descriptive soundscape, and just lose myself entirely.\nWe have now reached the penultimate track off the album and it is entitled Waltz With An Angel. Apart from this being an eloquent and somewhat expressive title, we have a gentle serene offering that would grace any new age album from the early part of this century with ease, those golden years of the genre would have loved this piece, but fortunately for us we have it right now before us to enjoy and bathe in.\nSo, we now conclude with Open Arms Part 2, we draw to a close this charming journey of sound with the summing up of the entire project with this last\narrangement. This ending piece is just another fine example of Lawlor's\nexpressive charm and a soothing final offering to finish the album with indeed.\nOpen Arms by Scott Lawlor in my opinion is Lawlor's best solo piano work to date; it was a moment I never wanted to end, and the creative skill he employs of this album is indeed thought provoking, but one that truly manifests a wonderful refuge away from the stresses and strains of modern day living. Lawlor's artistic endeavours have seen him bring into our world one of the finest slices of ambient piano work I have heard for years, and as such thoroughly recommended.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard One World Music Radio\n\"The nine tracks on Scott Lawlor’s Open Arms were improvised during August 2017 and although the album is listed as solo piano, there is a lot of alteration to the sound using reverb and/or electronic keyboards in addition to the piano. The music could have been recorded with a digital piano that has a lot of bells and whistles, but this isn’t a strictly acoustic solo piano album. That said, Scott Lawlor continues to be one of the most creative (and prolific!) musicians in the ambient genre both as a solo artist and as a collaborator. I was astonished to discover that he has 242 album titles available onbandcamp! As has been true of most of Lawlor’s music that I’ve reviewed (this is the seventh album), the music on Open Arms tends to be dark and somber, but there is a very deep emotional quality in this music that is often very beautiful and always very expressive.\nThe album begins with “Open Arms, Part 1,” a very open and spare piece that begins in the bass of the piano and gradually works its way up the keyboard, elevating the mood of the music as it goes. “Dream of the Empath” opens with a shimmering sound that suggests the feeling of being in a dream state. Dark and mysterious - a little spooky, even! - the dream is intense and not very pleasant, but it has its own kind of beauty, gently resolving at the end. “Come Away With Me Into the Cool Twilight” is much more peaceful and really does make you feel the cool air and quiet stillness of an evening walk or ride. “Love’s Reverie,” a dark and gently melancholy 12-minute piece, leisurely unfolds while seeming to look within to explore a range of emotions that are relaxed but not really happy. Very delicate and minimalistic, “A Gentle Embrace” feels more optimistic and contented. The 13-minute “My Tranquil Refuge” is both peaceful and hypnotic, weaving ambient themes together to create a misty, atmospheric sound that is easy to get lost in. “Waltz With an Angel” is interesting because it isn’t in 3/4 time until the end. It is lighter and somewhat more rhythmic than the other tracks, but is still very much in the ambient genre. Similarly to Part 1, “Open Arms, Part 2” is very spare, darkly mysterious and possibly even mournful. It trails off at the end and closes the album somewhat unresolved.\"\nReview by Kathy parsons of mainly piano.",

            "about": "This album was originally published on The Church of Noisy Goat in June of 2023, so if you purchased it from there, please don't buy it again. I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nSpank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.",

I loved how the playfulness of the sound, unexpectedness and mental power this music unleashes on the innocent listener. It's a sea of sounds in which sometimes we swim towards quasi-cacophony but at the same breath oftentimes we hear transcendent sounds that uplift the soul towards a beautiful state. A truly authentic, sincere and outstanding work of postmodern sound art.\"",

            "about": "The events of a life can be compared to pearls that are placed, pearl by pearl, in the velvet box of a human life.\nOne has the choice to view it as a gift, even though this pearl may be associated with a challenging event.\nEven or especially in dark times you can learn something, find something that has a certain use.\nThe album is the creative result of communication without words on this topic between Scott Lawlor and Ingrid N - from one end of the world to the other.\nMay the sounds, strung like beads on a string, bring joy to everyone.",

            "about": "This album was inspired by the 10 plagues of egypt most of which are represented with very dark ambient interpretations. Creating ambient music inspired by literature and horror fiction is a field that I've grown quite fond of and as a result, I give you another unsettling album that I hope brings to life the wrath of a cosmic entity who directed his anger towards those who held his children in captivity.\nThis album is a horror masterpiece that sonically reads as a novella, ala early stephen king. The production is dense, beautiful, rich and varied. It's an excellent atmospheric journey, like some kind of haunted castle film from the fifties. The titles are fantastic too and allow the listener to surrender and submerge into the depths of this production.\nMy favorite track is 05 - An Incidious Infestation of Lice thanks to its delicious psychedelic soundscapes and special effects [even though usually i'm not the greatest fan of such effects, here it works so well!!!].\nTruly an outstanding creative adventure.\nWings of an Angel\nwingsofanangel.bandcamp.com",

In particular, its extremes through atmospheric and ambient interpretations of such phenomena as the Polar Night and the Cryosphere, which is the frozen part of the earth’s water system.",

            "about": "A month after the horrific terrorist attack in Orlando Florida, (and yes, it was an act of terrorism, not a shooting) I am coming out with a much more controversial statement regarding the matter.\nThough my condolences for those who have been left behind will never fade and though there is a profound sadness in my heart for the condition of our world, I also feel a rage and fury towards two very distinct and destructive ideologies which I believe to be responsible for the attacks here and abroad, those being ISIS and political correctness.\nThis album will certainly offend the hell out of the politically correct crowd but I believe it is about time that this group of people got a rude awakening because they have twisted and perverted a concept of tolerance and respect into submissive acquiescence and capitulation by surrendering their own beliefs and values to appease the mob rule of the crowds who will never be satisfied with their efforts to compromise and agree with them on whatever the political or cultural issue of the day may be.\nThis album is also a message to the political elitists who have made the world a more dangerous place in which to live because of their absolute refusal to call out religious extremists for their barbaric attacks on American soil and around the world.\nThis is a glimpse into a future not too far off, one in which the forces of absolute evil plunder and destroy because there was no one left with courage to stand for civility and to meet such barbarism with oppositional justice. They were all too timid, too full of fear, too concerned with offending anyone lest they be met with scorn and derision and as a result, their fragile feelings were more important than their very lives and in the end, the planet was left decimated and void of human activity.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on\nvery explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nFor a panty fetishist, panties are eroticized to such a degree that simply looking at them in a store or catalog is extremely arousing. Something as simple\nas being asked to choose a partner's panties can be sexually gratifying.\nWhile some people love omorashi and wetting in general, others have very specific preferences. For many kinksters, this may relate to their first experiences\nin the kink - and their attempt to recreate that initial enjoyment. People into this kink are only turned on by wetting in a specific item of clothing.\nOther clothing items may produce no arousal, or may actually be a turn-off. Particularly popular examples include \"panty wetting,\" \"skirt wetting,\" or\n\"jeans wetting.\" Within those categories, there may be even more delineation such as \"thongs,\" \"hipsters,\" \"bikinis,\" etc.",

            "about": "\"And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a Virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the Virgin's name was Mary. And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women. And when she saw him she was troubled at his saying, and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be. And the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary; for thou hast found favour with God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a Son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David. And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end. Then said Mary unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man? And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God. And behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, she hath also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren: for with God nothing shall be impossible. And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.\"\nSt. Luke 1.26-38\nThese 7 tracks were taken from William Byrd's Gradualia ac cantiones sacrae, Liber Primus, performed by The Cardinall’s Musick, Andrew Carwood and run through effects from guitar rig, replica XT, Reaktor and Molecular to create the dark yet mysteriously beautiful reinterpretations of the sacred reminder of the annunciation.",

You were transferred to your heavenly home, O Lady, Queen and Mother of God in truth.\"\n\"The Assumption completes God's work in her since it was not fitting that the flesh that had given life to God himself should ever undergo corruption. The Assumption is God's crowning of His work as Mary ends her earthly life and enters eternity. The feast turns our eyes in that direction, where we will follow when our earthly life is over.\"",

            "about": "The north holds a fascination for us all, and those of us who make ambient music are constantly entranced by it. The barrenness, the starkly drawn horizon, the piercing cold — it makes for excellent subject matter. And who better to be considered the composer of the north than Jean Sibelius, composer of “Finlandia” and the “Karelia Suite”? When we think of Sibelius, we think of dramatic, vivid symphonies that recall the Lakeland grandeur of the Finnish landscape. But Nox Intempesta has put an entirely new spin on the music of this master with these three deconstructions that ironically may do more to invoke the desolate atmosphere of a northern landscape than Sibelius or Grieg ever did.\n“Tempestate Part 1 (Quercu)” reduces the composition to an ominous, slightly shifting drone, like trudging across a never-ending snowfield. Slight shifts in the tones may signify a rocky outcropping or a lone bird in the sky.\n“Finlandia” boldly reduces the famous piece to a half hour of stormy white noise with faint choral overtones; if this is Finland, you’re on the northern tip in the middle of a squall. Finally, “Tempestate Part 2 (Chorus ex Ventus)” again contains hints of ghostly voices, finally allowing elongated string tones to intrude into a disquieting tranquility akin to Bass Communion’s finest.\nThis is not comforting music; this is an immersive experience that doesn’t promise joy, though it does offer some enlightenment. And it’s a nice complement to other albums of deconstructions like Biosphere/Deathprod’s Nordheim Transformed.\nthegatelessgate.bandcamp.com\nNox Intempesta is the project of myself and Sevenism begun in 2015 on the ambient online forum at  ambientonline.org.\nsevenism.bandcamp.com\nsoundcloud.com/sevenism",

            "about": "Political correctness is the disease it purports to cure. We’ve become so enamored to curbing our minds, filtering our thoughts, policing our tongues that we’ve forgotten the ability to be independent. Instead we’ve conformed ourselves to a tedious gray-toned existence where the Zombie minds commingle in a self-revolving turnstile of mindless chit-chat that cannot escape the iron law of GroupThink Inc. Ours has become Orwell’s nightmare in inverse relation, rather than Big Brother listening in on our conversations, we have each other to thank. We’ve become victims of our own overzealous rage against the infractions of a thousand years of bigotry, racism, and prejudice so that now we have built walls and fortresses around our minds so that the irrational thoughts of the human animal cannot escape its own belligerent and feral desires. It has caged itself in a merciless and tyrannical hivemind where thought-control is the last order against the anarchy of thought itself. We’ve become the decadent children of an overloaded world of fractionating codes, guided by an algorithmic necessity we now live for better or worse under the tutelage of self-imposed command and control systems where only we are to blame. The Law of Unintended Consequences could not have envisioned a better stepchild.  socialecologies.wordpress.com/2016/04/29/rage-against-the-night-of-political-correctness/",

            "about": "“In creating this, the final chapter in my Rain Trilogy, I used the same equipment set up which I utilized on the previous two installations. This time,\nI was influenced by Palancar and his track entitled ‘She and I, Watching the Rain’. Where the first rain piece was more ominous with its\nthunder and organ drone, and the second much colder with the minimal chords and snowfall, I present to you a warmer interlude which presents the nearness\nof the spring season and the rains that give vitalization to a world recently gripped by the ice, snow and cold.",

            "about": "This album is a bit unusual for me in a number of ways, and not just regarding the music, as I have done many different things insofar as musical output is concerned over the years.\nYesterday I was playing around with blocks primes and decided, for the hell of it, just to stream what was playing randomly on my youtube channel, because, why not?\nThis morning, I did something similar, using some different patches from blocks primes but added delays and allowed the time of the stream to be determined by a random event that would occur, specifically the completion of the first wash cycle of the day.\neven the artwork is random as I just picked something that I felt would fit the music, getting no input from anyone sighted on the image or it's quality as I usually do.\nSo, as you can tell, this album is truly random in every sense and aspect in which I normally do my art just because, why not do something once in a while that is totally chaotic and undetermined?\nTrack 3 is an alternative extended version of track one, demonstrating that what is recorded in reaper can be very different from what streams, especially if you forget to enable some parameters for your tracks before recording. Again, more unanticipated randomness and thus, why this album is titled the way it is.",

Kimberly Braun.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/theotokos\nOne year later, she reached out to me and asked me if I would be open to composing original minimal music to serve as the background for the meditations of the current Advent season.\nI was honored that she would make such a request and have been enjoying creating these tracks and so have decided to release them for your listening pleasure and perhaps for your personal journey of spiritual growth and meditation, if you have such a belief system.",

The exception is track 11, \"Wind Through the Pines\". I wanted to create a very dark atmosphere of the middle of a forest of pine trees in the dead of a winter storm, to paint a different picture than you might automatically associate with a phrase like Wind Through the Pines.\nReflecting Light inspired by naviar haiku 279\na mountain stream splashes out inspired by naviar haiku 278\na Clear day inspired by naviar haiku 283\nShadows of the pines inspired by naviar haiku 170\nMagnolia Sky inspired by naviar haiku 282\nTwirl among the trees inspired by naviar haiku 273\nSummer Grass inspired by naviar haiku 281\nMoon Gazing inspired by naviar haiku 277\nIcicles filled the long window inspired by naviar haiku 171\nMoon Gazing (Extended version) inspired by naviar haiku 277\nWind Through the pines inspired by naviar haiku 170\nReflecting Light (extended version) inspired by naviar haiku 279",

            "about": "This is a collection of songs for the Christmas season some of which have appeared on various compilations between 2013 and 2018.\nThese 9 tracks have all recently been remastered, however there is a \"lost archive\" feel to some of them as the technology I had when making these recordings isn't as advanced as what I am currently utilizing.\nThe tracks here range from the sublime ethereal ambience of the title track and one less at the Christmas Table, written for my brother Joe in 2018, to more experimental tracks like Demented Memories and Furniture polish which is mangled treatment of the sample of a music box.\nDrone for Christmas was originally released on the BFW Christmas 2013 compilation:\nwww.bfwrecordings.com/releases/Christmas/2013/\nFor Whom the Bells Toll on Christmas Day was originally released on the Christmas 2015 compilation:\npetroglyphmusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-xmas-compilation-2015\nDemented Christmas Memories and Furniture polish was originally released on the Christmas 2016 compilation:\npetroglyphmusic.bandcamp.com/album/507-christmas-2016\nAngels We Have Heard While High was originally released on the Christmas 2017 compilation:\npetroglyphmusic.bandcamp.com/album/585-the-x-mas-compilation-2017\nOne Less at the Christmas Table was originally released on the Christmas 2018 compilation:\npetroglyphmusic.bandcamp.com/album/623-petroglyph-x-mas-compilation-2018\nI encourage you to download and check out these compilations as all the music is amazing and the artists are top notch in their respective genres of ambient and electronic music.\nThank you for your continued support of my work in sound and imagination. I wish you a most joyous and merry Christmas.",

            "about": "Regretz sans fin (“Endless Regret”) is one of the most poignant chansons by Josquin Desprez. 1450-1521), a great master of Renaissance music. In artful polyphony, he transforms the grief about a lost love and an irretrievable time into sound, a work of art that still deeply touches listeners until today. Intertwining voices paint a picture of painful longing, while Josquin's harmonic boldness broke the boundaries of the music of the time. It is a chanson, a secular vocal composition that was popular in France and the Netherlands during the Renaissance. Although it is not entirely clear when it was composed, in the late 15th or early 16th century, the piece reflects the spirit of an era in which secular music was valued just as much as sacred works at the courts of northern France and Burgundy.\nJosquin, who composed for princes and popes, combined courtly elegance with deep human feeling. This melancholy beauty continues to inspire people from all over the world to this day. This piece is not only a musical jewel, but also a timeless testimony to how art can transform deep human emotions into harmony.",

            "about": "These 3 tracks were taken from various sacred choral material and run through effects from guitar rig, replica XT, Reaktor and Molecular to create the dark yet mysteriously beautiful reinterpretations of the sacred reminder of one of the most pivotal events in the history of the world.\nEven though it was miraculous, what happened on that fateful day must have also been horrifying to the disciples and my reinterpretations attempt to capture not only the profound beauty of this event but also the very human feelings or fear and astonishment which must have been experienced by all who saw Jesus upon his resurrection.\nHaving seen the Resurrection of the Lord was performed by the National Academic Choir of Ukraine 'Dumka'\nInvitatorium 'Surrexit Dominus' (Dominica Resurrectionis) was performed by the Schola Cantorum of Amsterdam Students\nResurrection Canon was performed by the Kyiv Chamber Choir",

            "about": "Waiting is not the strong suit of many of us in our hurry-up culture. Everything is urgent. Hope is foreign to people who expect quick relief, cures, and solutions. We struggle to guard Advent jealously because popular culture short-circuits this season of hope: We are tempted to go directly to celebrating Christmas without getting in touch with the part of ourselves that is longing, hoping, and trusting.\nThe following pieces, written and performed in 2015 on  stillstream.com,  are intended to help with your wait, help you take your foot off the accelerator and just be. Christmas Day will come, just don’t let it come too quickly.\nTwo tracks from this album were originally released on the weareallghosts label on December 20, 2016. They have been enhanced and a third track from the rex Gentium sessions was added to the album.\nad-venire was performed live on  stilstream.com  December 12, 2015\ncome and free the prisoners of darkness was performed live on  stilstream.com  October 13, 2015\nRex Gentium was performed live on  stilstream.com  December 23, 2015\nartwork by Thomas Mathie of weareallghosts",

            "about": "Engineer Braddock's commercial space tug has been badly damaged and he and his men are left floating in alone in space. Their distress beacon is detected\nby a mysterious ship governed by the eccentric geneticist Dr. Moreau. However, this ship is home to more than just the enigmatic doctor. The S.S. Moreau\nis a biological space station brimming with life. Deep within the jungles of the ship are creatures that are, in fact, the hybrid products of his experiments\nupon various species of alien lifeforms. As Moreau and his assistant hurry toward their horrible goal of creating the ideal life-form, the beasts revolt,\nthreatening not only the captain and his team of scientists but Braddock and his crew as well.\nRich with industrial textures and deep bass driven spacey drones,\nthis is one dark ambient experiment you won't want to miss.",

            "about": "This album was originally published on Gates of Hypnos in July of 2023, so if you purchased it from there, please don't buy it again. I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nSpank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nScopophilia is a psychiatric term that literally translates as the love of looking. People with this fetish, known as scopophiliacs or scopophilies, become aroused or achieve sexual gratification by openly looking at naked bodies or erotic acts.\nSigmund Freud coined the term in his Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality, published in 1905. It entered in the common vernacular in the early 1920s. The term scopophilia is a combination of the Latin word scope, meaning to see, and philia, meaning attachment or attraction.\nScopophilia is also known as Scoptophilia.\nfrom gates of Hypnos:\n\"Spank Hookers comes back with another colossal, slowly evolving opus dedicated to scopophila, a sexual fetish focused upon looking at nudity and erotic arts. Distant windy dark ambience, distorted drones and variety of samples create a dreamy, disturbing atmosphere to sink within.\"",

My deep gratitude goes to each of them for giving me the opportunity to work with them and improvise over their excellent sounds and drones.",

            "about": "This is the fourth volume of the on-going series of collaborative efforts between myself and other very talented friends in the electronic and ambient community.\nIn this fourth volume, which was recorded between August and November of 2021, you'll hear collaborations among many musicians and sound alchemists who I have collaborated with over the years as well as new people who I have had the pleasure to work with for the first time. My deep gratitude goes to each of them for giving me the opportunity to collaborate with them, improvising over material which they have provided for the project or them improvising over sound worlds that I have given to them.\nI hope you enjoy almost 6 hours of brand new music recorded with 25 fantastic artists, all of whom, you should check out and support where you're able. All are listed in the credits section.",

            "about": "This is the third volume in a series of collaborative efforts.\nInspired by the wildly popular and successful \"Cousin Silas and Friends\" concept, I have decided to try something similar myself with collaborators old and new.\nIn this third volume, which was recorded between June and August of 2018, you'll hear collaborations among many musicians and sound alchemists who I have collaborated with over the years as well as new people who I have had the pleasure to work with for the first time. My deep gratitude goes to each of them for giving me the opportunity to collaborate with them, improvising over material which they have provided for the project or them improvising over sound worlds that I have given to them.",

            "about": "This is the first volume of what will hopefully become an on-going series of collaborative efforts.\nInspired by the wildly popular and successful \"Cousin Silas and Friends\" concept, I have decided to try something similar myself with collaborators old and new.\nIn this volume, which was recorded between March and May of 2017, you'll hear collaborations among many musicians and sound alchemists who I have worked with over the years as well as new people who I have had the pleasure to work with for the first time. My deep gratitude goes to each of them for giving me the opportunity to work with them and improvise over their excellent sounds and drones.",

A scream tore through the stillness, raw and jagged, echoing into the void. It clashed against the dullness, swallowed by the gray, as though even sound had no place in this desolate space. The flickering light wavered, but the shadows remained, unmoved, as the scream faded into nothingness, absorbed by the endless dimness surrounding it.\"",

I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nOriginal notes from SBR:\n\"Screaming at the Light\" is a mesmerizing dark ambient album by Scott Lawlor, marking his first release on Slithering Black Records (SBR). This entrancing musical odyssey delves into the world of enigmatic sounds and eerie harmonies, showcasing Lawlor's prowess in creating immersive soundscapes that transport listeners beyond the realm of conventional music. Each track on the album offers a journey through shadowy atmospheres, punctuated by hauntingly beautiful sonic textures that seem to emanate from a hidden source, as if truly 'screaming at the light.\"",

            "about": "\"2013 belongs to Scott Lawlor....\nTake a look at his discography from this year (and the year is only 3/4 over as I write this...).\n• Complex Silence 36 - Treetrunk Records\n• Times Escape - We Are All Ghosts\n• Constant 29 - Treetrunk Records\n• Dark Mind - Buddhist On Fire\n• Rain 1 - Webbed Hand Records\n• Desert Winds - 45 Echoes Sounds\n• Like A Pelican of The Wilderness - We Are All Ghosts\n• Haiku 03 - Subterranean Tide\nNow add to that\n• Seeking Rest - Free Floating\nThen add to that The Blind Flight podcast and Stillstream radio show and I'd say it will soon be time to nominate him for the Brin Coleman Award for Prolificacy\nin Ambient Music.\nBut I completely get Scott's motivation. Once I entered into the ambient music community on the Internet I was inspired to share and create in much the\nsame way that Scott has been.\nAs you can hear from Seeking Rest, that inspiration has resulted in some beautiful ambient music. According to Scott, this piece was born from two earlier\npieces he composed in the 1990's but never released. He reworked them into this track in one take with no overdubs. That's what Scott is capable of.\nI'm sure you'll agree that this track is perfect for Free Floating. It moves slowly and subtly, taking you with it through the clouds. If you can't find\nrest with this piece, then I don't know what else would work for you.\nThis one is highly recommended to play on repeat to keep you floating peacefully all night (or day).\"\nBrad Ross-MacLeod\nVancouver, WA",

            "about": "This series was originally conceived resulting from a post on the  ambientonline.org  forum way back in 2014. The original thread is no longer available but a good many artists came onboard to execute the science fiction concept I had in mind at the time.\nIt was originally released in early 2016 and since I have gotten a great number of followers since those early days on bandcamp, I decided to upload the series here for pay what you want.\nI had created 24 hours of drone material using my Ensoniq TS12 synthesizer and some other audio processing software which I subsequently sent out to several members of the ambient community and the results are a stunning collection of soundscapes and immersive drones in a 6 volume series under the project name of the Vega Chronicles.\nYou'll find links to the artist pages in the credits of each volume and I encourage you to follow them and support their amazing work if you're able to do so.\nPrologue\nIn the far distant future, a select group of people begin having strange dreams and visions of a distant alien culture.\nIn the night sky they see a faint flickering glow, the last great gasp of a collapsing star, Vega.\nAs the glow weakens, the visions and dreams multiply, compelling some of the people to use sound to transcribe these visions and share them with others.\nYears before, on a small planet orbiting the star of Vega, the sentient inhabitants had evolved to be able to communicate vast distances through a form of telepathy.\nDiscovering Vega would soon destroy the only home they knew, the best astronomers of their civilization searched the heavens and located a few other beings who would be able to receive these telepathic transmissions.\nThe civilization gathered the most talented, learned, and wise teachers, historians, and artists to transmit the history of the planet; from its distant past to the turbulent present before the dying star consumed their world.\nThe only hope for their race to be remembered was if an alien species could understand, translate, and share this cultural archive with others. This was the last and best chance for them to be able to say \"we were here\".\nForeword\nThis project is an archive of translations of those transmissions that are only now reaching Earth after traveling the interstellar distances that separated our two worlds.\nArtists from around Earth have been in contact with each other in order to compile an archive containing this treasure of information.\nThis archive is now known as The Vega Chronicles.\nThe Vega Chronicles is presented in a series of 6 tomes, divided into 4 chapters each.\nIn total, they comprise a 24-hour aural encyclopedia of culturally and historically significant events of this world which was blown into oblivion by its star.\nBecause of the effort of this group of highly skilled artists, engineers, teachers, cultural anthropologists, and other great minds from across all manner of sociological and theological disciplines of this far away planet, it's culture will live on in you, the final witnesses to a planet's culture and its inhabitants, now gone but not forgotten.",

            "about": "This series was originally conceived resulting from a post on the  ambientonline.org  forum way back in 2014. The original thread is no longer available but a good many artists came onboard to execute the science fiction concept I had in mind at the time.\nIt was originally released in early 2016 and since I have gotten a great number of followers since those early days on bandcamp, I decided to upload the series here for pay what you want.\nI had created 24 hours of drone material using my Ensoniq TS12 synthesizer and some other audio processing software which I subsequently sent out to several members of the ambient community and the results are a stunning collection of soundscapes and immersive drones in a 6 volume series under the project name of the Vega Chronicles.\nYou'll find links to the artist pages in the credits of each volume and I encourage you to follow them and support their amazing work if you're able to do so.\nPrologue\nIn the far distant future, a select group of people begin having strange dreams and visions of a distant alien culture.\nIn the night sky they see a faint flickering glow, the last great gasp of a collapsing star, Vega.\nAs the glow weakens, the visions and dreams multiply, compelling some of the people to use sound to transcribe these visions and share them with others.\nYears before, on a small planet orbiting the star of Vega, the sentient inhabitants had evolved to be able to communicate vast distances through a form of telepathy.\nDiscovering Vega would soon destroy the only home they knew, the best astronomers of their civilization searched the heavens and located a few other beings who would be able to receive these telepathic transmissions.\nThe civilization gathered the most talented, learned, and wise teachers, historians, and artists to transmit the history of the planet; from its distant past to the turbulent present before the dying star consumed their world.\nThe only hope for their race to be remembered was if an alien species could understand, translate, and share this cultural archive with others. This was the last and best chance for them to be able to say \"we were here\".\nForeword\nThis project is an archive of translations of those transmissions that are only now reaching Earth after traveling the interstellar distances that separated our two worlds.\nArtists from around Earth have been in contact with each other in order to compile an archive containing this treasure of information.\nThis archive is now known as The Vega Chronicles.\nThe Vega Chronicles is presented in a series of 6 tomes, divided into 4 chapters each.\nIn total, they comprise a 24-hour aural encyclopedia of culturally and historically significant events of this world which was blown into oblivion by its star.\nBecause of the effort of this group of highly skilled artists, engineers, teachers, cultural anthropologists, and other great minds from across all manner of sociological and theological disciplines of this far away planet, it's culture will live on in you, the final witnesses to a planet's culture and its inhabitants, now gone but not forgotten.",

            "about": "In 2015, I released this album on the weareallghosts label, my first in what would become an annual cycle of Easter related projects.\nSeven last words is a more meditative approach to the events leading up to the celebration of Easter and what is the defining event in the Christian religion, the resurrection of Christ.\nIn 2017, I went back to the original tracks of this album to remaster them and add a few more subtle layers throughout to further relay some of the emotion and sorrow that was a part of many moments of the time when Christ was pronouncing his seven last words from the cross. I especially wanted to bring this out in what has been said is the favorite track by a lot of people on the album (The 3rd Word - Mater Dolorosa) and so I added some additional cello. For the rest of the album, I added a new layer of bells which I believe sound better than what was available to me at the time of original composition.\nIn 2018, I decided to alter the ending of the album and to remove the resurrection track in favor of a darker extended version of the 7th last word. This makes the album almost 80 minutes of meditative reflective ambience for Easter or any other time you need music to calm the mind and take an inward journey.\nreview by Steve Sheppard of One world music radio:\n\"Scott Lawlor is known across the world for his vast productions of dark ambient music, ones that cerate wide open landscapes of sound that literally travel through time and space, in this latest release he has taken on the topical subject of Easter, of giving his interpretation of the Christian faiths religious celebration and explains in his own words, \"Seven Last Words is a more meditative approach to the events leading up to the celebration of Easter and what is the defining event in the Christian religion, the resurrection of Christ\"\nFor me, it is another chance to dive into the deep waters of the mind of the artist, and navigate each and every track along the way, giving each creation credit on its own merit and standing, and enjoying something that Lawlor does so well and that's creating opuses of vast intent, with a multi-dimensional quality, like the opening piece, Introduction - Love, Loss, Redemption and the proclamation of the Seven Last Words. Here stands a composition of sublime understanding, one that has an underlying texture of realization bathed into the arrangement.\nThe chime of the bell at the start of The 1st Word - 0 pateras tous synchoref giati den xeroun ti kanoun is a really nice touch and adds a deliberate effect of ambience to the overall composition, creating an artistic juxtaposition between the beauty of the days cadence, to the tragedy of events about to unfurl, this, like all the tracks flow into each other with a seamless transition.\nWe are then transported into the following narrative of The Foreshadowing of Entombment. This maybe short form in size, but compared to many other tracks off the album it is easily the darkest, I have been into a tomb here in Cyprus and I can tell you first hand it is an ominous experience, and this track would fit that experience perfectly.\nThe chimes now usher in a second word and that title is The 2nd Word - simera tha eisai meg mou ston paradeiso. There is a real distinct elevation of energy here; one can feel the floating essence of Lawlor's synths really take hold, it is like the music is literally lifting you up as you listen. This musical rhapsody floats with a pristine quality into the following narrative called The 3rd Word - Mater Dolorosa. This I would say was my favourite piece from the release, the cello sound here is deeply moving, but manifests a whole new reality of sound and depth within the album. I rate this, which is one of the longest offerings off the album, to be the cleverest. Again there is a juxtaposition of music being played out here, the lightness of the synth work which has elevated three fold, but the darkness and sombre narrative of the Cello, totally and utterly classy indeed.\nThe next sojourn of music takes place at the track entitled, The 4th Word - Eli Eli lama sabachthani. Here lies a lighter touch; a truly sensitive approach that is quite delicate to perceive; this gossamer winged opus manifests something quite breathtakingly beautiful but also sorrowful and deeply haunting in within its musical complexities.\nWe now find ourselves in waters uncharted musically speaking, as we come across a composition called, The 5th Word - ah-NEE tsah-MAY. These next two offerings are shorter in length than the spine of the rest of the album, but both with, The 6th Word — Tetelestai being the following offering, create an uplifting sense of reality within the release, one could feel that within the music, we are being offered a tableau of change, of rebirth perhaps, both pieces float beautifully together in a virtual ascendency of musical symbiosis. These two fine examples of musical cleverness are what make Scott Lawlor one of the foremost electronic musicians of his age.\nThe very last pathway of tone and timbre now stands before us in all of its glory and it is called The 7th Word - Pater in manus tuas commendo spiritum meum. This arrangement is the longest offering off the album at 15 minutes long and from the hovering synth work and back drop of distant angelic harmonious voices; it seems to be a composition of a completion, one of\ntransmutation of sorts. The skill set of Lawlor is such that he literally feels each note he creates and thus establishes a creator's relationship with it. Here he brings you an end of the album, as such it is, but one that maybe leaves the listener questioning their thoughts in a final piece where there are more questions left than answers.\nScott Lawlor has stood strong and created this vast iconic work of art with his heart on his sleeve, and his mind open to all possibilities. This is what makes this album for me enticing, there can be no doubt that Lawlor is a prolific electronic musician, and within this offering entitled Seven Last Words, he has created an album that will be adored by the legions of dark ambient fans around the globe, and will intrigue each and every listener it comes into contact with.\"",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nA sexorcism is a sex act designed to extract a demon or evil spirits from a person’s body\nwhich is typically a rough sexual encounter.\nThe term is a portmanteau of the words sex and exorcism, the latter being a ritual designed to drive an evil entity out of the body.\non this album, I took a track from my enormous archive of unreleased old drones, ran it through some glitchmachines plugins, imported that result into komplete, ran it through molecular, then added instrumentation from Sample logic's xosphere, Native Instrument's Mysteria and zero-g's alien skies, running those presets through guitar rig and molecular and mastering it all with ozone 9.",

            "about": "This album was originally published on The Church of Noisy Goat in June of 2023, so if you purchased it from there, please don't buy it again. I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies of all time and being inspired by the work of Cory Strand and his many movie reinterpretations, and since I reinterpreted the Green Mile back in 2016, I decided to go ahead and release my interpretation of this classic movie and soundtrack in a series spanning several volumes.\nThis is a combination of noise and dark ambient tracks which were created in 2016.\nOriginal notes from the Church of Noisy Goat:\n\"Listen today on @noisygoatchurch to the new album by our supporter and Ambient Music artist renowned on the Bandcamp scene: Scott Lawlor. This is the first volume in the series of reinterpretations of the film Shawshank Redemption, which Scott Lawlor made inspired by the seventh art masterpiece of the French director living in the United States: Frank Darabont. It is strongly recommended that you watch this visceral film and download the album to have it in a high quality format. The next four volumes should be released in the future here at the Church. The darker mood of drama cinematics is portrayed by Scott Lawlor expressively and introspectively with his drone instruments. Adding to the sound layers are some field recordings that add positive value to relaxing and immersive listening. Listen carefully to this release from start to finish and pay tribute to this giant of spectral music who is starting a brand new special collection just for you.\"",

Delving into the Dark Ambient, he created this series of albums inspired by the movie Shawshank Redemption, which tells the story of two inmates held at the famous ShawShank State Prison in the USA.\nThe depressing and morbid climate of a movie chain is musically portrayed in an extremely visceral and introspective way by Scott Lawlor in two long tracks with a vaporous, cinematic and very dark atmosphere of homogeneous electronic sounds. An album that should greatly please and satisfy lovers of contemporary Dark Ambient is about to be all yours and savored by you in those moments when you want to be alone with music that can give you goosebumps if you let it.\"",

This series, within the Bandcamp scenario, is already practically an alternative soundtrack to the film, in the field of dark music with sinister and creepy drones. We are doing our part to keep it on top and you can help us by getting a copy of this and the previous two volumes in this collection by visiting our website. This is already the collection of albums preferred by ten out of ten music lovers, moviegoers or not, who are tied to Dark Ambient and follow the Church. If you appreciate Dark Ambient like we do here at the Church, you will certainly recognize Scott Lawlor's innate talent in the meticulous description of the film's soundscapes, which is a drama of the most visceral possible, that is, a rich source of references from which Lawlor is worth and applies with mastery in his powerful music.",

I typically upload albums that have been on other lables assuming that I've got some followers who may not follow those other bandcamp sites.\nThe Shawshank Redemption is one of my favorite movies of all time and being inspired by the work of Cory Strand and his many movie reinterpretations, and since I reinterpreted the Green Mile back in 2016, I decided to go ahead and release my interpretation of this classic movie and soundtrack in a series spanning several volumes.\nThis is a combination of noise and dark ambient tracks which were created in 2016.",

The music for this enormous 12 and a half hour album was completed in November of 2022 using a combination of shortwave broadcasts and different virtual instruments such as bioscape, Dronar Master Edition and haunted spaces.",

            "about": "These 11 tracks were inspired by different Haiku poems and, in some cases, were submitted to the Naviar haiku project, a weekly challenge where artists are given a poem and then have seven days to compose a piece of music inspired by that haiku.\nThese compositions were inspired by haikus 065, 120, 049, 123, 010, 116, 078, 089, 031, 011 and 065 respectively and were recorded between June of 2015 and September of 2016.\nTo learn more about the project and view past archives, you can visit  naviarlab.tumblr.com/archive\nThis recording shows the amazing versatility of Scott Lawlor as a musician and a thinker. A lot of his material is dark, even noisy, and yet here is an album of celestial beauty that hearkens back to the vintage days of early new age/ambient.\nCosmic synth melodies abound over beatific textures in a set of pieces that can be traced back to the influence of Suzanne Ciani, Steve Roach, Vangelis, Jarre, Kitaro, and other new age pioneers, but like all great music, Lawlor’s music has a piece of his own soul in it — a distinct yearning for spiritual peace that sets his vision apart from others.\nThis is a stunning achievement and something every fan of the beautifully melodic end of ambient should and will enjoy.\n—Allister Thompson  (makeyourowntaste.com,   thegatelessgate.net)",

            "about": "The sound of rain: a favorite ambience, especially on a cold day sitting in my favorite chair with a warm cup of coffee. The children have been dropped off at school and the house is silent. For those moments, I am just being, simply existing, enjoying the quiet as the gentle sounds of nature play outside my window.\nThese 11 improvisations are a guide to listening to the rain and an encouragement to slow down a bit, stop and just be.\nPlaying the album on sort is encouraged as this will create different narratives for your mind with each subsequent listen.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nThis most recent outing by our luscious ladies of lust and debauchery comes courtesy of me remixing one of my older tracks from the album Improvisations for piano and electronics. You can find the original track here.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/track/improvisation-for-piano-and-electronics-7\nOur hookers depend on physical closeness to facilitate their particular brand of fetishism but due to the pandemic and physical distancing, they are out of work. what ever will they do with their time now? Soul searching, deep self-reflection on their life choices? Hell no, they're pissed off at the politicians for putting them out of work and when the mandates are lifted, they will return in full force to unleash more debauchery, more perversions and more eroticism than the world could have ever imagined and they'll have more work than ever.\nFor now, listen to the closing of the first series of their adventures in lust and filth, an hour of shifting dynamics that serve as a requiem, a temporary good-bye as they isolate themselves to flatten the curve, not theirs.\nPlease understand that This album is not intended to make light of the seriousness of the virus which has impacted many but to bring attention to the issues related to the very tangible problems effecting sex workers who, because of their trade, can't collect unemployment and don't qualify for subsidies which are afforded to employees of other businesses effected by the political decisions of sate and local officials.",

            "about": "Included in Kathy's list of favorites for 2018:  mainlypiano.com/favorites/kathys-favorites-2018\nThis album was inspired by the profoundly touching story of Nancy Rynes and her near death experience. Her radio interviews moved me to tears and struck a chord within myself for the longing of a divine presence which I had connected with earlier in my life, a presence which I walked away from consciously long ago but on a more profound level, the longing was still there, drowned out by the busyness of life and dysthymia, a mental condition not as deep and episodic as depression but one which is more longstanding, like a faint shadow of gloom over most of my existence.\nFor many years, tainted by the dogma, rigidity and inflexible rules of different Christian denominations I had tried to embrace at different points in my life, and wanting nothing to do with those interpretations of spirit, I came to the conclusion that yes there was a god but he was impersonal, an intelligence who set the universe in motion and just let it run down with no intervention.\nStill in shock over my brother Joe's death last year, and then finding out that I recently lost another dear friend in an automobile accident, the need to reach out beyond myself and try to connect with the spirit world was rekindled along with a profound desire to be open to signs that those who I love are doing okay in the afterlife.\nAfter hearing Nancy's account of her experiences and those of others who have had NDE's, (I took comfort and solace in hearing the stories and accounts of those who have gone and returned)\nI felt a calling to respond to what was happening internally and so, as usual, music is the vehicle for those internal responses and it is my hope that this album will have a profound effect on you, the listener and that it will take you on a journey to the interior where you will also encounter your own divine presence by way of a profound soul journey.\nTo Learn more about Nancy and her work, visit  nancyrynes.com\n\"There is something so transcendent about the work of electronic musician Scott Lawlor; he has in his time created great cathartic symphony’s through the medium of his synths, and to be honest it is always a wonderful musical journey I travel each time I get to review a new Lawlor album.\nIn my opinion Lawlor’s work has steadily improved from release to release and now on Soul Journey those floaty synths seem to be the master creator at manifesting such ambient landscapes that seem to stretch into infinity, like the first track off this new album, which is rightly the title track.\nSoul Journey and the journey of souls has been a work in progress for me for many years, even more so after the incredible work of Michael Newton and his book Journey of Souls, then the thought came to me, I can read that book again and listen to this album, it seems so fitting, its spacious and calming and the music seems to float all around me, without any intrusions, the perfect ambient offering indeed.\nScott Lawlor has an ability to truly feel his music, so that when he releases it, he immediately connects with his audience in a soul to soul way, now listen to the charming narrative of our current voyage of souls through the piece Divine Presence. The style reflects more towards the ambient side of the new age genre here, in fact this track reminds me a little of Deuter but without the flute, the reference to this new age giant is that Lawlor seems to have manifested in a similar style, a perfect state of oneness on this offering, and by adding the bells and choir, given the arrangement a true ethereal feeling to enjoy.\nStructure of Love is our third track off this four piece album and is another splendid slice of tranquillity from the artist. However it feels like a new narrative is being drawn here, one can sense both a reality of lightness within this offering as if something is being constructed ever so slowly, with great care and attention to detail. There is something quite beautiful about this offering that seems to transcend the normal use of the word, beauty as in, deep within the structure of the very essence of love perhaps. Scott Lawlor’s performance here is sublime and with each note played he manifests a whole new dimension of ambience.\nOur last piece from this four part album is called Celestial Guide, the movement here across this wide expanse of music is profound, and at this juncture perhaps we are meeting the energy of our soul teacher, our guide through this realm. This is the longest piece off the release at well over half an hour, and I urge you not to look at the timings when listening to this album, they are largely irrelevant, the journey is the main thing here, by giving yourself to this release with an open mind and heart, you will find it a most pleasurable and peaceful experience indeed.\nI found Soul Journey by Scott Lawlor a truly healing voyage of great electronic music, in my view this is his best work so far, the elevation of purpose and energy this album manifests is blissful, this is a wonderfully fulfilling and ethereal escape into the realms of ambient music, one that is filled with an abundance of love and letting go. Soul Journey by Scott Lawlor would be perfect for any meditative practises, or just for a restful sleep, as this superb new album creates all around you, an atmosphere of tranquillity like never before.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio\n\"Scott Lawlor’s Soul Journey was inspired by the story of Nancy Rynes and her near-death experience after being hit by an SUV while riding her bicycle. Quoting from her site, Rynes explains: “I should have died, but while surgeons worked to repair my traumatized spine, my spirit was in Heaven. Instead of dying, I was overcome by a powerful beauty, love and joy - and allowed to return to Earth to share what I learned.” Profoundly moved by listening to Rynes’ radio interviews, Lawlor found himself longing for a divine presence that he had connected with earlier in his life, but walked away from long ago. Still reeling from the deaths of his brother and a dear friend, Lawlor found that a need to “reach out beyond myself and try to connect with the spirit world was rekindled along with a profound desire to be open to signs that those who I love are doing okay in the afterlife.” Feeling a call to express some of these internalized emotions and reactions, Lawlor did what he does best and went to his synthesizers and keyboards to create the music for this album. His hope is that it is “a journey to the interior where you will also encounter your own divine presence by way of a profound soul journey.”\nSoul Journey consists of four ambient, ethereal tracks that are soothing, but truly feel like a journey. This is the fifth of Lawlor’s many albums that I have reviewed, and his music always seems more “musical” than that of many ambient artists. I’m not sure what that special something is, but Lawlor’s albums go far beyond the categories of “space music” or “healing music” to a realm of deep emotional expression coupled with a bit of magic.\nThe title track begins the Soul Journey. Dark and mysterious at the beginning, strings, voices and orchestral and atmospheric sounds surround the listener, beckoning him or her to follow, effortlessly soaring heavenward. The darkness lightens and the pace slows to a graceful feeling of floating through an endless calm and gentle warmth. I’m fascinated with Lawlor’s ability to convey power and a soothing peacefulness at the same time.\n“Divine Presence” is the second track. Ethereal voices, strings, pipe organ and chimes create an atmosphere of beautiful light that surrounds the listener/traveler with warmth and a profound comforting of the spirit.\n“Structure of Love” is somewhat more mysterious, adding flute sounds to the gently flowing instrumentation. It’s 14 1/2 minutes of heavenly bliss!\n“Celestial Guide” is by far the longest of the tracks at almost 32 1/2 minutes, but what a wonderfully uplifting guided tour through the stars and heavens. and what a gift to be able to escape to a place where all is well, and there are no conflicts, diseases or unhappiness.\nSoul Journey is an exceptional ambient musical experience by one of the genre’s most exceptional artists!\"\nReview by Kathy Parsons of  MainlyPiano.com",

            "about": "Ingrid N:\n\"This was a close and intense collaboration with Scott Lawlor,\naccompanied by a sense of mutual support.\nThis album is centered around the theme of spiritual growth and\nstumbling forward with confidence in exploring the mysteries of life\nhere on earth.\"\n\"We tend to encounter God’s reputation before we (knowingly) encounter God. We gather all sorts of bits and pieces of information about God, some of it good and useful, some of it wildly off-centre and frankly harmful to us and others. . .\nIf we are to speak of God as [God] is, then, we need to check what we say as often as possible against the touchstone of our experience of living towards holy encounter. And acknowledging that both our individual experiences and accounts of the common experience of the Church can be bent out of shape by prejudice, stereotype and idiosyncrasy, we need always to hold what we say and hear with a certain provisionality. Though this worries many people, there is no contradiction between this and faith. . . . As is often said, the opposite of faith is not doubt but certainty.\nFrom many directions, from the Bible and from philosophy and from the Church’s practical experience of prayer as understood down the ages and wrangled into shape by theologians, there is agreement: God, who reaches out to us in love and mercy, through the life of Jesus Christ and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, who meets us in worship and sacrament and prayer and in moments of grace in the natural world and in human relationships, is at the same time far beyond our reach. The words we use to describe God are more like gestures to point our attention in the right direction than they are like a scientific description or dictionary definition. . . .\"",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nThis album explores the raw unbridled passion of the art of the spanking and implementing this as the giver of pleasure from a dominant\nhooker to her submissive. It's the act of disciplining, the concentration of her power through erotic domination which allows her to explore her own eroticism.",

            "about": "I present to you a more experimental collaboration, something that took me in some unexpected directions with my piano playing in an interesting concept as outlined in the below notes from Mike.\n\"This album has been an idea that I have had in my head since the first Covid shutdown. I met Scott through his own generosity on bandcamp. We had been chatting music for a little bit when I brought the idea for this album up to him. I originally had the idea of turning music into a walk to and from a mirror...as if you walked right up to it from a good distance, once you came up to it, literally walking backwards away from it. The funny thing about reflections is the unknown. Is it an image of you or a different side of you or a doorway somewhere else. Even if it resembles the same being in front of it, it is never exactly the same. We shot out to do the same with music. This project took on its' own form and became something that is a reflection of itself and still stood alone. I have to thank Scott for his help putting this together, there was help from another who respectively asked to be left a silent help. I still need to at least say thanks publicly because without all involved this wouldn't be what it is. I am quite proud of this and glad for all the assistance I have had putting this together.\"",

            "about": "“But as he stands before imminent death, he grasps its nature also, and the cosmic import of the step to come. His creative imagination constructs new, fearful prospects behind the curtain of death, and he sees that even there is no sanctuary found. And now he can discern the outline of his biologico-cosmic terms: He is the universe’s helpless captive, kept to fall into nameless possibilities. From this moment on, he is in a state of relentless panic.”\n― Peter Wessel Zapffe, The Last Messiah",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nStygiophiles are attracted to kinky, \"sinful\" sex which they believe will send them to Hell. It’s the thought of damnation, rather than the sex itself,\nthat really turns them on. They may also be turned on by the idea of being surrounded by heat and flames. Many stygiophiles express their preferences through\nartworks of sexual acts taking place in Hell, which they may find or post online.\nStygiophilia is closely related to pecattiphilia, which is sexual arousal inspired by commitment of sins and feelings of guilt.",

You continue to floor me with your work. I love the piano all throughout all the tracks, but especially in the title track (I admit I'm a bit of a sucker for piano). This whole album sounds as though Chopin and Debussy had a baby, and I love it.\"\nladycuniverse.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "The man stood resolutely, remorsefully, as the thick fog enveloped his figure, a lonely physical form on a bridge, overlooking the calm river, 200 feet below his feet.\nHe was out here on a mission, well, in his mind it was a mission, even if the goal was a passageway into the afterlife.\nThe afterlife, it had to be better than the life on this planet, the life he has lived for so many unfulfilled years, or was it decades, or even centuries...it seemed eternal.\nwhen had this gradual descent into the chamber of darkness begin? Maybe it has always been there, calling him, whispering to him hauntingly, beckoning him to embrace it. It was always so desolate in the dark, surrounded by nothing but regret, wrong turns, the steps that seemed to go nowhere, climbing aimlessly, always being out of focus, feeling that there was something more but wondering, yes wondering how to obtain it, and if he could, maybe there would be hope.\nBefore he had walked onto this bridge in the middle of the city shrouded in fog, he had come from a church. Actually, it was a cathedral.\nLike every night when his work was done, he was alone with his dark intrusive thoughts, the black images that wouldn't leave his mind. So he walked out the door, leaving his life behind, it wasn't really unusual since he had always gone for walks at night to try to clear his head before returning to his home for a few hours of repose before he arose in the morning and had to do it all over again. Day in and day out, it was always the same, no variation, nothing different, just the same script that he had to read from, the lines that he had memorized that had been repeated so often that he could no longer distinguish between who he really was and what he was pretending to be.\nHe walked through the giant door of the cathedral. It was empty but for a couple of people who were kneeling in prayer. Prayer, what was that? He used to know a long time ago, used to talk to God all the time, he had believed what they had told him about God and his Son, that Jesus was the author of peace, the bringer of life and those who were thirsty, he'd give them living water, and to the tired, he'd take their burdens. these words were more abstract than the fundamentalists he'd run into later at college, the ones who would tell him that he needed a \"personal relationship with Jesus\".\nNow that he was in this sacred space, it all came flooding back to him, the memories, the promises, the hope which was professed to be real by the speakers of the truth.\nAs Pontius Pilate had said before the crucifixion \"what is truth?\" Then he had washed his hands...of what, the upcoming deed or the truth which external forces were trying to impose on him?\nHe looked up at the cross and felt abandoned, the head told him that the man hanging there had died for him. \"he died for all of us because he loved us\", fundamentalists had said over and over, maybe in different words but the message was the same. He couldn't fathom it in his heart, a being of any kind that could love him so much that he'd take the form of a man, be humiliated, put on trial for crimes he didn't commit and then be brutally executed for him? Why?\nIt made no sense, none at all to his logical mind where every action had a reaction and every choice had a consequence.\nStill looking up at the cross, he heard the words again that he had heard as a child. \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him, shall not perish but have everlasting life\". That was close enough for the man in the cathedral.\nThe debt must be paid, the debt must be paid and yet, conventional wisdom or, what he had come to conclude was mindless dribble, had told him for years that the only way to repay the debt of the death of God was to accept the gift of eternal life.\nit was a paradox that he couldn't get his mind around, it confused him, flew in the face of all he had logically determined as truth for himself after so many years without God.\nAnd yet, the invitation to \"be Still and know that I am God\" was still there after all this time. He continued staring at the cross, his mind screaming no!!! This isn't logical, I don't want his love!!!\" Why? because he knew that it would be impossible to love another being as deeply as this one would love him, and that was an enormous obligation that he knew he could never fulfill.\nSo he ran out of the cathedral and kept running, feeling all the while that he was being chased by something or someone. While he was running faster and faster, he remembered the story of the hound of heaven. Wasn't that the story where a man was running from himself and he was being chased relentlessly by a hound and when he turned around, it was God? Never mind, it didn't matter. If he was going to live, he'd look it up on Wikipedia just so he'd have the story straight in his own mind. exact quotes didn't matter so much but having a narrative the right way in his mind was important.\nHe felt a presence, actually, he picked up the scent of perfume and while standing on the bridge over the calm river 200 feet below, he heard the soft footfalls. Now he knew that his sense of being chased wasn't an illusion at all.\nThe woman put a delicate hand on his shoulder and whispered softly \"a dream of Beauty is an illusion in a life of loss\".\nThe man turned around and realized that she was right. His life had been full of dreams of beauty, but he had always lost all of them by foolish actions, choices that demanded consequences. For him, the consequence was inevitably loss, followed by profound loneliness and isolation.\nnow he felt his sanity slipping away, a foreshadowing of the life that would be lost at any moment by a choice that he was determined to make.\nHe stepped closer to the rail and then paused. He had expected her to instinctively pull him back from the rail but she didn't. did she want him to die? That would be unspeakably cruel and heartless, to want a stranger to die with no cause whatsoever.\nHe laughed inside at the irony of the situation. Here he was, ready to take his own life because he felt it was empty and yet, he felt that a stranger allowing him to do the very thing that he had come here to do was unspeakable. it was another paradox he couldn't comprehend.\nHe turned around to face her, his hound of heaven and she said \"I am your dream of Beauty in a life of loss\".\nHe asked \"Are you God?\" She said \"today I am and tomorrow He'll be someone else for another person in desperate need of living water and eternal life. Your afterlife is here, you've just been unaware of it all this time.\"",

            "about": "At the beginning of 2013, it was very obvious that we needed a new washer and dryer set so the night before we were to get rid of the old appliances,\nI decided to have some fun with the dryer and record a bunch of different household objects taking tumbles in an appliance that would soon meet it's demise.\nMy son helped out with the project and we had quite a bit of fun throwing brick fragments, metal bowls, loose change, shoes, plastic coat hangers,\nwooden alphabet blocks, silverware, a chair leg and even sweet potatos into this metallic beast which had outlived it's usefulness.\nAfter creating a couple of ridiculous versions of the recordings for people with really short, long and eternal attention spans, I decided to scrap the project, no pun intended.\nA friend of mine actually kept the documentary of symphony for prepared dryer and a year and a half later, after I heard someone on twitter do a piece for microphones in really bad places,\nI decided to give the set another creative chance and the results are much more manageable to listen to and I feel, much more creative than the treatment I had given them when I originally thought up this concept.\nI'd like to thank Rune Martinsen & Øystein Jørgensen for their album called Triumph Standard 12\narchive.org/details/TriumphStandard12\nwhich gave me some direction in ways to consider manipulating these recordings.\nSo now, I invite you into a dark ambient experimental realm, a world where everyday objects are tossed around in a whirlwind of mechanical tumbling, but except for the titles of the tracks,\nyou probably wouldn't know what the items really were.\nThe album includes the original documentary where you can listen to us enthusiastically throwing items into the dryer as well as hearing the objections of my wife regarding other creative endeavors which I thought would be fun to record but which didn't happen.\nAlong with this release are the original samples for remixing and mangling if people are interested in such ideas.\nI only ask that if you do decide to remix and/or mangle the samples, I would appreciate attribution and notification about where I can hear the results via the contact email address on the site.",

            "about": "Take a journey through the frozen distant past of Mars as you explore glacial formations, enormous ice fields and peer into the icy abyss of one of the largest canyons in the solar system. It was 3.5 million years ago that such glacial activity was to have occurred, according to recent scientific discovery. This then, is a soundtrack to a journey through the frozen regions of the planet next door. Be prepared to be immersed in an eternal ice-age with Metadronos and Yours truly as your guides.\nThis reissued edition includes new artwork and an extended improvisation composed exclusively for this version of the album, a track titled Colles Nilli.\nReview from Ambient Exotica:\nDuring the annual Winter Ambient Review Cycle that takes place at AmbientExotica every December, I officially invite artists to submit their works without delineating the concept. This is done on purpose: firstly, there is not much to explain per se when this sequence of words (Winter + Ambient + Review + Cycle) appears. Secondly, it is superfluous to outline the concept of icy or glacial albums to those who create them in the first place. Finally, the opaque approach is in fact inverted, turned upside down more often than not and suddenly becomes as transparent as can be when there are no rules attached. I’m asking for submissions of wintery and cold albums or EP’s, true, but that’s not to say that the aurally depicted locales need to be real, let alone earthbound. Texan synthesist Scott Lawlor and Koszalin, Poland-born patch/stem luminary MetaDronos team up to prove a different kind of winterized hibernation called The Ancient Glaciers Of Mars.\nOriginally released in November 2014 on Xenomorph Recordings located in Dundee, United Kingdom, it encapsulates seven tracks of synthetic Space Ambient. These entities at first deliver what the listener expects: dark matter drones, diffuse diffractions of eclipses and lights, a few distant pulsating blebs and molecular paroxysms. These things do indeed appear, but in a tastefully streamlined form. These viridian glaciers are not so much cinematically pompous and daunting; they rather seem like a primordial soup. What this means for the genre compatibility in general and a winter-related circumambience in particular will be further carved out below, including a powerful cloak-and-dagger coup de main conceived by both artists.\nTime and the universe go well together, for a human’s concept of time is tested – detested even – when one is brave enough to let his or her mind ponder the endless vastness of the spatial abyss. As such, the state of the opener Rivers Of Ice Flowing From Mount Sharp is consequentially elasticized, with its opening phase being prolonged for two minutes of slow, cavernous fade-in sequences and hexangular drone cataracts in the distance. Curiously calorific due to the depth of field and increasing voluminosity of the low frequency hydrazine, MetaDronos and Scott Lawlor fathom the quasi-heterodyned epiphany of the differing surfaces: in lieu of histrionic darkness and exogenous percolations, everything flows. Faraway temple bells and ethereal stokehold engines pass by, vitreous flashes of pluvial chimes glitter in the distance. As the seraphic main synth grows and prospers, the endemic photometry turns increasingly glaucous and tends to resemble the human grasp of wintery landscapes much better than before.\nSaid comprehension is then amplified in Winter In Herbes Chasma whose limewashed haze of alkaloidal swooshes is ennobled by a dangerously iridescent ignis fatuus. Its prolonged sustain is luring and autochthonous at the same time; the amethystine glow is luminous enough to feel like paradise, but the attached contretemps and compunction only let the experiencing subject observe these events from afar. The droning monotony has to be heard to be believed. The light neither flickers nor increases, it is a consistently oneiric source of uneasiness and solace, a dichotomous cotyledon amidst raging storms and thus a classic Space Ambient aureole. Meanwhile, Streams Of Ice In Echus Chasma inherits the streamlined plateau-esque physiognomy but is otherwise willfully tame and remains under the radar. This is actually a great endeavor, as the close inception of the textures’ focal point and compatibility allows for a magnanimous process of senescence. There are laser-like wind gusts in the background, resembling efflorescent sirens, but their appearance aside, the third piece is drowned in a veneered rubicund granuloma, droning on independently regardless of any observation or witty remark. The adjacent Fluvial Channels Of Melas Chasma absorbs the same pattern but sees the collaborating duo multiplex a seraphic-ecclesiastic high-energy drone; its helicoidal viscidity spawns thermal heat and crimson warmth. It has the classical flavor of a finale, a divine apotheosis, but in fact serves as the album’s apex, with three more tracks to come.\nThe first of that triptych is Icy Echoes Of Valles Marineris where the first-ever intrinsic element penetrates the cosmic epithelium: a spacy potassium crystal pierces its way through an arcane antrum, its haunting mucoid scheme emanating etiolated hoarfrost. In tandem with the frizzling gusts of pink noise and the repellent murkiness of the rufescent drones, coldness has entered MetaDronos’ and Scott Lawlor’s spheroidal braiding, leading to the stupendous Glaciers Of Ius Chasma and their beguiling polyphony of cauterized lanthanoids and perennial tendrils. This droning concoction is as fuzzy and coevally tangible as ever, but sees its synthetic anhydride altered yet again by a new element: a spiky ebow. The darkly energetic power scythes and cuts like a transfigured disk saw. Traversing the mauve-tinted pericarp ad infinitum, it leaves a lasting impression floating into the endpoint Glacial Activity On Aeolis Mons. Clocking in at 18 minutes, this final piece augments a strangely sylvan-sylphlike lightness with the softly clandestine chromaticity of stacked flumes of light. In lieu of brummagem ornaments, the duo ends the album comparatively peacefully, spawning light-resistant expectorations of energy and chlorotic-aeriform jitters. Roaming freely in this languorous ether of coldness, they spend solar solace and annihilate the glacial shape while fading out in a state of benthic fluidity.\nNo jagged prongs, no jitters, zero lavabos or tramontane protrusions, The Ancient Glaciers Of Mars is a clear-cut Space Ambient affair that focuses on the eruditely celestial and gelidly evocative heritage of the genre. There is a surprising – but entirely refreshing – omission of ornamental helixes such as pulses, quasars or other electric vesicles that grace similarly themed albums. And why should there be such things, given that MetaDronos and Scott Lawlor candidly reveal the concept. Winter on Mars differs from hibernal landscapes on Earth, but the duo never succumbs to an adamant alienation and rather prefers to create transformative aurorae. The album does not sound particularly Mars-like, if such a remark even makes sense. In this regard, the artistic approach seemingly fails, for isn’t this what is promised via the album title and with the help of bold futuristic letters on the front artwork? Aye, but there’s an important supplement to this notion that is more than a mere appendix: both synthesists do not present Mars “as is,” but want the listener to “take a journey through the frozen distant past of Mars.” This, then, is the album’s gimmick and clear-cut embodiment of the oft-cited term retro-futurism. The 70’s vibe is admittedly missing, as is the kind of heroic positivism found in Space Operas, but what The Ancient Glaciers Of Mars – luckily! – lacks in these regards, it gains in the buildup of Mars’ nullspace, an interstice not yet available for human inspection. As such, Winter and Mars are not directly targeted by the soothing sound waves and alluvial circumambience. It is the superimposition of genre markers, conrastive temperature zones and aphorisms that makes this work belong to neither category, caulking even the hindmost expectation with an alloy of mellow contraventions.

I organized the tracks in such an order that they tell a narrative of someone exploring an old attic of forgotten relics and memories.\nI'd like to thank Graham of less than One for sending me the samples and for granting me the opportunity to be a part of this ongoing remix project.\nThese 5 tracks are also available as part of the fencepost reclamation project volume 6\nlessthanone.bandcamp.com/album/the-fencepost-reclamation-project-volume-6-2",

            "about": "This album of 10 solo piano improvisations, written between January and February of 2018, explore some of the ever present emotions as a result of grief and loss. Where \"in a dark room\" approached the grieving process from a more emotional perspective, this one feels a bit more philosophical and reflective, realizing at the most existential level, I am now a different person than I was before and how those differences, though not always obvious to many, have changed who I am at a fundamental level.\nreview by Jonathan Widran \"\n\"This is the truth that all of us who have lost a brother or sister have to live with every day for the rest of our lives: the truth of loss and sorrow are ever present, as a shadow reminding us that we are forever transformed and to many, transformation can be an unsettling and scary concept.\nEven though we are on a journey to a new normal, remembering the day or night that changed our lives makes us stop in our tracks, mourn again for a moment, reflect on the loss and we are reminded of not only where we came from to get to this new normal but that it is a continuous journey, never arriving until we meet our loved ones in the afterlife.\n\"If there is anything I have learned from listening to ambient new age composer, performer and improvisational master Scott Lawlor’s musically expansive\nand consciousness expanding works, it’s that grief and its many stages of acceptance and transcendence take time. In May 2018, I was privileged to experience\nand absorb (for a listener doesn’t merely “hear” his soul-transporting music) his extraordinary recordings Transition and In a Dark Room.\nThese were emotional, deeply hypnotic and cathartic collections created organically in tribute to his beloved brother Joe, his struggle with stage 4 cancer,\nhis passing/transition and Lawlor’s’ intense struggle to find light, new life and perhaps universal meaning in the wake of losing a beloved soul far too\nsoon. Musically, he began the cycle with the introductory experience of Look Unto the Heavens, a powerful opening attempt to seek such meaning amidst the\npain and suffering.\nAs engaging as the previous trilogy but perhaps the most engaging and sonically palatable for the casual fan of new age/ambient music, his most recent\nrelease The Color of Extraordinary is a magnificent continuation of Lawlor’s multi-faceted emotional journey. The other recordings featured some piano\nelements, but this is a full-fledged epic piano collection, infused with pure, raw yet beautiful and lushly flowing pieces – composed in January and February\n2018 – exploring, in his words “some of the ever present emotions as a result of grief and loss.”\nLawlor is an excellent essayist who often quite eloquently expounds in words what he is trying to convey – and his sometimes lengthy track titles are deeply\npoetic. Yet his sparsely arranged music is so honest and intimate that our open hearts would probably be able to feel what is happening inside his heart,\nmind and soul even without his explanatory essay. He tells us that he’s making a transition here from the emotional perspective of “In a Dark Room” to\none that is more philosophical and reflective. It’s lovely, of course, to have that laid out, but those with finely tuned spiritual antennas could intuit\nthis just from the titles and the flow of the music. The album title alone informs us of the solid breakthroughs taking place and the generally serene\nfeeling of love in the light of a slightly deeper sense of acceptance of life’s most perplexing mysteries.\nOne of the most notable shifts from Lawlor’s previous works dedicated to his brother is the fact that eight of the ten pieces are briefer, more easily\nconsumed and connected with than the lengthy, ultra-meditative pieces that previously dominated. His elegiac approach to the piano is immediately soul-satisfying,\ndrawing us in emotionally from the get go – a very different mode of expression from the earlier slow building soundscapes of atmospheric seduction. That\nsaid, the emotional core of The Color of Extraordinary are the two longest pieces, the dark, haunting, endlessly questioning “what if music is what escapes\nwhen the heart breaks” (reminding us that his gift of cathartic expression through rhythm, melody and improvisation is perhaps Lawlor’s true salvation)\nand the stark, spacious, atmospheric and deeply exploratory 18 ½ minute meditative masterpiece “She peered over the ledge of heaven.”\nDespite their overall sense of darkness, contemplation and working through the pain to find connective light somewhere within the tunnel, many of the shorter\nexpressions on the album ease across our consciousness like more commercial, traditional sounding new age solo piano recordings. Whether by design or simply\nthe way his divinely inspired fingers found new life, pieces like the eloquent, moody “The darker the night, the brighter the stars,” the gently meditational\ntitle track (where gloom is shattered at certain moments by brief sparks of light) and the bleak, brooding and deeply philosophical “The deeper the grief,\nthe closer is God” are a bit easier to grasp emotionally.\nLawlor uses the titles of these shorter improvisations to help guide us through the powerful soul-work he’s been doing. “our souls contained more scar\ntissue than life” is slow and soulful, but has some of the collection’s most dynamic melodic movement – i.e. a ray of hope. Where the equally melodic,\ngraceful but daringly optimistic “grief and love are conjoined,” the soft spoken sense of eternal life is more deeply felt on this side of the veil. Lawlor\ncontinues that theme on the last two tracks – “There is no grief like the grief that does not speak” and “But my grief will never go” – to let us know that\neven if shards of light envelop him so that he knows his beloved Joe is alive and thriving in another dimension and feels his love, his pain will not subside\nuntil the two are reunited in the eternal realm. That’s when he’ll know the true Color of Extraordinary, and where the sorrowful music will give way to\npure soul-cleansed joy.\nIf you visit Lawlor’s bandcamp page after listening to The Color of Extraordinary (or the other works dedicated to his brother), you might find yourself a bit intimidated by the sheer output\nof well over 200 ambient releases. Yes, it’s a lot and it may take you a little exploratory time to find another entry point. But once you start immersing,\nand begin healing in ways you could have  never previously imagined, you’ll know why I wrote in my review of Transition: “If you are into soulful, thought\nprovoking and consciousness expanding ambient music, Scott Lawlor is a composer and artist who needs to be on your musical radar. His vast body of work\nwill keep your ears attuned for a long time to both your inner spirit and that indefinable ‘other’ in the Universe.” You might just color the experience\n“extraordinary.\"\nwww.jwvibe.com\nFrom Steve Shepard, One World Music Radio:\n\"Scott Lawlor has been prolific lately with the release of many fine albums, most will know him for his sublime floating synths, but here on this album we explore the solo piano abilities of the artist with the release The Color Of Extraordinary.\nWe start this journey of ambience with the opener The Darker the Night, The Brighter the Stars. I adore this style of piano performance, when I play keyboards I’m aiming for something similar. There is something quite purposeful, yet delicate in this piece, which really sets the scene for the whole album.\nI remember reading an article about Eno once, it was said that he manifested music specifically for an art exhibition at one time, now I am a big lover of modern art, and when in the UK will try and visit the Tate gallery, I may well take this album with me, as it would be perfect for the visit, especially this quite wonderful offering called, What If Music Is What Escapes When A Heart Breaks. This is a true explorative voyage of musical tone and timbre that you’re ever likely to find.\nThe almost minimalistic title track is up next and of course entitled The Color Of Extraordinary. This offering has a slight feeling of awareness about its construction. Lawlor’s skills as an ambient performer are creating here for us many dark and twisting hallways, of where what might be deemed the extraordinary, may lurk.\nI love reading and listening to the works of Edgar Allen Poe, I was only doing so just the other day in a moment of relaxation, now if I had of been playing this album, I would have had the perfect soundscape to add to that twinkling of time, especially this one entitled, She Peered Over The Ledge Of Heaven. This has all the hallmarks of something deep and mysterious, but in his performance the artist also creates something vast and quite breath-taking in an ambient sort of way. Long form at its best here by Lawlor, as he creates an 18 minute plus opus of beautifully spacious music.\nHistory Dressed up in the Glow of Love’s Kiss Turned Grief into Beauty is our next port of call, I mentioned Eno earlier, and perhaps I should remember one of his musical partners in Harold Budd, with this light and floating offering, which is similar in style, one that has a real sense of blissfulness about its overall construction, a nice mood changer here from the musician.\nWe now move into the realms of shade and shadow once more as we come across a piece called, The Deeper the Grief, The Closer Is God. For me there is a real juxtaposition of composition and thought here in this offering, one that is clearly mysterious in energy, deep and brooding in essence, one that explores the very labyrinths of grief, and its relationship with the enigma that is called god, a fascinating and very in depth opus indeed.\nLet’s now open the door to a dimension called Our Souls Contained More Scar Tissue than Life. There was something of an undercurrent about this piece, one that revealed many layers of emotion as it played out to its conclusion. It seemed to work with the realms of both light and darkness, but at all times retained a fluency that seems to hover and drift around the piano itself.\nGrief and Love Are Conjoined is our next offering that fluency continues here with a symbiotic composition of great musical clarity. This would be one of my personal favourites off the album and listening to the performance one could with ease imagine a musical helix, swirling in and out of itself, grief and love combined perhaps.\nThe ever decreasing circle of sadness plunges further within this next piece called, There Is No Grief like the Grief That Does Not Speak. There is a fathomless pit of emotion within this offering that is so very tangible, sometimes the silence of nothingness speaks volumes. The performance here is heartfelt and moving, but one that also creates a void to allow oneself to get lost within, perhaps to escape the grief!\nBut My Grief Will Never Go is our final composition, Lawlor explores the nature of griefs illusion within this offering, this is beautifully played and is lighter in composition and arrangement that one may assume from the title, this cathartic journey through sufferance and pain may continue, but while it may seem like grief will never go, it does in fact eventually transmute into the form of acceptance, and for me that is what I get from the performance within this track, one that has a slight hint of something that we must all have in its tones, hope.\nScott Lawlor and The Color of Extraordinary is a wonderful journey through the darker emotions of ambient piano from the artist, it gives us many moments of sadness and dark moods, but also hiding within the very soul of the album is a little courage and faith. Lawlor’s works are a fine example that music is the panacea that cures all ills and woes; it is the courage and fortitude of Lawlor to express this in music, that gives all of us who have suffered grief in some way, a prospect, an aspiration perhaps of an expectation of hope.\"\nreview by Steve Sheppard of One World Music Radio:\nwww.oneworldmusic.co.uk/scott-lawlor/4594458298\nFrom Kathy Parsons of Mainly Piano:\n\"The Color of Extraordinary is a collection of ten solo piano improvisations by the incredibly prolific (and gifted!) Scott Lawlor. Darkly ambient, this album is something of a postlude to Lawlor’s trilogy of albums dealing with his younger brother’s cancer diagnosis, death/transition, and the grieving process that followed. The Color of Extraordinary was recorded in early 2018 and Lawlor describes the music this way: “….this one feels a bit more philosophical and reflective, realizing at the most existential level, I am now a different person than I was before and how those differences, though not always obvious to many, have changed who I am at a fundamental level.” The ten pieces provide well over an hour of atmospheric music that is easy to have in the background, but more focused listening - perhaps in a darkened room - is the key to fully appreciating the music and experiencing the emotions being expressed. As with Lawlor’s previous albums, the titles to the pieces are fairly long and poetic, providing insight into what he was thinking as he created the music. Reverb is used extensively, adding to the atmospheric vibe of the music and giving it a somewhat otherworldly feeling.\nThe album begins with “The darker the night, the brighter the stars.” By alternating major and minor chord patterns, Lawlor effectively alternates between the sounds of light and darkness as he sets the tone of the album. “What if music is what escapes when a heart breaks” ventures into much darker emotional depths, almost meandering around the piano keyboard searching for answers and perhaps realizing that closure will likely never be fully achieved. The title track isn’t really melodic or rhythmic, but is probably more accessible to those who prefer a less ambient style. I have no idea what the title “She peered over the ledge of heaven” refers to, but this 18 1/2-minute work is the centerpiece of the album. It begins very quietly and mysteriously with open space between many of the notes/passages. The first several minutes are ominous and eery. The next section moves up the keyboard a bit, becoming lighter and more comfortable. Throughout the piece, open space continues to be as important as the notes whether they are in the deep bass of the piano or up in the treble. Improvisation doesn’t always suggest a musical stream of consciousness, but this piece does and is an in-depth exploration of an artist’s musical thought process. The last few minutes feel lighter and more optimistic, with some kind of acceptance or resolution achieved. “The deeper the grief, the closer is God” begins with a return to the depths of despair. At about the midpoint of the piece, you can feel a powerful uplift in the music that gradually brings comfort and a stronger sense of peace. It truly is amazing how much can be expressed with such an economy of notes. “Our souls contained more scar tissue than life” is the piece I like best on this album. Introspective and often poignant, honesty and vulnerability seem to flow from each note. “But my grief will never go” ends the album with an expression of acceptance that permanent change has occurred - an “it is what it is” of sorts. It is far from light-hearted, but my interpretation is that there is now an ability to move forward.\nScott Lawlor is a master of expressing complicated emotions with open space and a minimal number of notes. I always come away from his recordings feeling like I have shared a personal and emotional experience with him.\"\nmainlypiano.com/reviews/scott-lawlor-the-color-of-extraordinary\nreview by Dick Metcalf:\nThis is my first listen to pianist Scott’s deeply moving and evocative solo\npiano work… for me, keyboard playing is best when the artist is immersed so deeply in their work that no external influence can interrupt their thoughts\n(or their playing).  That’s what you (definitely) get as you listen to the (somewhat) dark-toned title track, “\nThe Color Of Extraordinary\n“… Scott is able to use the lower registers to pull forth colors you would never have imagined on this slowly moving composition… it has already gotten\nrepeated listens here.\nScott’s song titles alone clearly show that he gives a great deal of thought to his playing… one of the best examples of that (for this reviewer, anyway)\nis “\nour souls contained more scar tissue than life\n“… it’s almost like he was a “soul surgeon” (so to speak), examining life and finding ways to heal with his music.  I’m very impressed with his playing,\nand if you love well-performed solo piano without gimmicks – this is your ticket… if I were on the “award panels”, this piece would definitely be recommended!\nI searched, but didn’t find, any examples of “live” playing, but Scott has some great music videos… I recommend you\nSUBSCRIBE to his YouTube channel right away\n… I did!\nAfter some personal grieving and loss, Scott’s own words described the process of realizing these tunes as “realizing at the most existential level, I\nam now a different person than I was before and how those differences, though not always obvious to many, have changed who I am at a fundamental level”…\nyou’ll find his emotional explorations on the deeply moving opener, “\nThe darker the night, the brighter the stars\n“, show his total talent for drawing the listener out… in fact, this is my personal favorite of the ten songs Scott offers up on this release.\nThis isn’t your “standard” solo piano album… it requires close listening (preferably with headphones ON) and involvement… I give Scott a MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\nrating for his unique approach, with an “EQ” (energy quotient) rating of 4.98.\ncontemporaryfusionreviews.com/deeply-evocative-solo-piano-works-scott-lawlor-the-color-of-extraordinary/",

            "about": "Hail holy Light, offspring of Heav’n first-born,\nOr of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam\nMay I express thee unblam’d? since God is Light,\nAnd never but in unapproached Light\nDwelt from Eternity, dwelt then in thee,\nBright effluence of bright essence increate.\n. . .\nthee I revisit safe,\nAnd feel thy Sovran vital Lamp; but thou\nRevisit’st not these eyes, that roll in vain\nTo find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;\nSo thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,\nOr dim suffusion veil’d. Yet not the more\nCease I to wander where the Muses haunt\nClear Spring, or shady Grove, or Sunny Hill,\nSmit with the love of sacred Song . . .\n. . .\nSo much the rather thou Celestial Light\nShine inward, and the mind through all powers\nIrradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence\nPurge and disperse, that I may see and tell\nOf things invisible to mortal sight.\nJohn Milton: Paradise Lost (III.1–6; 21–29; 51–55)\nThis album was inspired by the song \"a Saucerful of Secrets\" by Pink Floyd. Headphones are highly recommended",

            "about": "2 years into the plague of suspicious origins that swept over the world and blew open the door for authoritarianism to take over the planet, citizens of the world were seeing their inalienable rights to assemble and bring grievances against their governments disappear before their eyes in real-time through the unfiltered lens of social media and independent journalists. Did God invent the machine of communism which demanded the removal of its creator which left a vacuum to be filled by corruption, greed, tyranny and an absence of morality?\nThe people who applaud the jailing of individuals who have legitimate complaints against rapidly encroaching tyrannical rule are the same people who scatter in fear at the first sign of the light of liberty and freedom. They are content to be locked inside a chain link fence of control and micromanagement while the others, who mourn the loss of the world they knew, look on in horror and shock at the rapid transformation of their society into something unrecognizable which they no longer want to be a part of.",

            "about": "Shortly after completing work on my Nocturnes files for that series, Ingrid asked me if I would be interested in improvising over her gongs and crystal harp sounds.\nI was honored that she'd make such a request so this project is our second collaborative effort.\nUpon careful listening to each of her exquisite soundworlds, I found myself in a very meditative space that lead to intentional improvising which created some very unique and immersive sonic experiences.\n\"The album and track titles were inspired by the writings of Elizabeth of the Trinity (1880-1906)\nfrom Ingrid N:\nScott has taken me far beyond my musical boundaries by inviting me into his incredibly rich and complex sound world.\nWith \"Approximation - Unknown Zone\" and \"Enter the Unknown Zone\" in \"Nocturnes , Volume 12, \" I refer to this.\nThis second album is undoubtedly a valuable addition to my musical experience and our enjoyable collaboration is a great gift to me.\"",

The dialect had changed since the last visit to this planet.\nThe Arecibo message is deciphered as a threat, and a call to war is made.\nThe Consciousness travels across galaxies to return to this forgotten world.\nMankind is divided. agreements cannot be made about the upcoming threat.\nToo many opinions. too many points of view. politics. disagreements. independent thought.\nselfish humans. Concerned with themselves more than with the Whole.\nThe Consciousness sees mankind’s need for unity and begins to insert itself into the minds of the weak. The Consciousness spreads quickly and assumes control once again. A new voice is heard among mankind. One voice.\nhumanity fades as the hive mind regains control.",

            "about": "Inspired by the poetry of Thomas Keating, from the Secret embrace. Song titles taken from The Last Laugh.\nAbout this album, Wings of an Angel says:\n\"I am listening to this album in the background at this very late hour... (01:26 in the night). sometimes it's excellent to go back to home-base. It has a rich sound palette which I love... And after an even closer ingestion and inspection, it's actually one of the best space albums I have heard from you or generally speaking. It's really an ambient masterpiece without a shadow of doubt. It's topping the highest level melodically and harmonically, on par and even greater with the best albums by Altus, Robert Rich etc'. This album has spirit and soul, it's nothing new under the sun, but it's everything spiritually, providing the perfect soundtrack for rejuvenation and mental healing. I am really falling in love with it and will undoubtedly listen to it many times on my long-distance trips. BRAVO MAESTRO!\"",

            "about": "\"Among the great questions of the human heart, none is more central than the question, “Who am I?” And among the great answers of the human spirit, none is more central than the experience of “I Am.” In fact, in the course of an intensely lived human life — a normal human life filled with the search for Truth — this question and this answer eventually run parallel to each other, coming closer and closer together until the question becomes the answer and the answer becomes the question.\"\nJacob Needleman - I am Not I\nThis is another set of cosmic space improvisations done on my Roland fa08 between April and May of 2016.",

Even when we gather in community, we gather each having individual experiences.\nAdvent is a season that highlights our personal inward journey- in a solitary way.\nOpen up to notice what reveals within you when you inquire,\n\"Where is Divine Light vibrant within me?\"\nNotice what comes into your awareness, ideas, concepts, thoughts, images, body sensations, etc...put no limit and take in everything.\nOpen up to notice what reveals within you when you inquire,\n\"Where is there dark within me?\"\nNotice what comes into your awareness, ideas, concepts, thoughts, images, body sensations, etc...put no limit and take in everything.\nMake a pact with yourself to honor all parts of yourself this next four weeks. Choose to welcome all parts, those you know, those that are hidden. This way you will have the opportunity to experience the power of both within you.\"\nThese tracks were inspired by Rev. Kimberly Braun's Advent meditation series given in 2023 and were written between December 4 and December 20th.\nSource of current was inspired by Luke 11:34-35.\nEven Darkness Shines was inspired by Prayers of the cosmos : meditations on the Aramaic words of Jesus by Douglas-Klotz\nPresence of the Breath was inspired by Matthew 17:20\nResponding to the Presence was inspired by Om Svayam Agurutva. by Star BG\nHallowed Silence was inspired by Prayers of the cosmos : meditations on the Aramaic words of Jesus by Douglas-Klotz\nThe Illusion of Separation was inspired by Kimberly Braun's poem entitled making Friends with Emptiness\nAwareness of Countenance was inspired by Matthew 5\nenergetic Flow was inspired by Prayers of the cosmos : meditations on the Aramaic words of Jesus by Douglas-Klotz\nThe Night is as Light as Day was inspired by the Spiritual Canticle by ST John of the Cross:\nIridescent Reflection was inspired by Radiance Sutras: 112 Gateways to the Yoga of Wonder and Delight by Lorin Roche\nBreath Expanding was inspired by an advent meditation given by Kimberly Braun December 18, 2023\nAwaken to the Reality was in response to Kimberly's chant for the meditation on December 19, 2023.",

            "about": "This is volume 1 of a new series that I've been working on since the beginning of April as a way to provide some internal comfort and peace of mind for those who need it during this time of physical distancing and social isolation.\nThis is the only volume that is longer than the rest and is made up of older material, some of it going back to 2016 but it hasn't been released until now.\nClarity of Light was first broadcast for an online live concert for One World Music radio on April 22, 2020\nUncertain Present was recorded for a one-off-broadcast on the Mostly Ambient Radio show for June 9, 2016 then rebroadcast on the same One World Music radio concert where the final track, Possibility of Hope also aired on April 22, 2020.\nHere are the notes about each of the tracks.\nClarity of Light paints a sonic picture, recounting days, not too far in the past when our daily lives and activities were normal, not yet effected by shelter in place mandates, daily reports of rising infections and body counts from a virus unfamiliar to many of us.\nUncertain Present is a portrayal of the anxiety and uncertainty we all feel in what have become, as mush of a cliché as it is, \"these trying times\". We are moved to look inward, to reflect on our very lives, though some of us may be tempted to run and hide from the darkness this may reveal about us as a society. On the other side of the coin is the positive spirit, the willingness we possess to move outward, to help those in need in what limited means are currently available as social distancing guidelines are put in place to protect us from the evil of a replicating invisible biological danger.\nPossibility of Hope is a musical example of the indominable spirit of mankind as he rises up to face the challenges of the day and create a better society, one built of hope and love from the brokenness and isolation which we have all experienced during the reign of this most grave pandemic.\nGood most certainly will have its victory over evil as is always the case, though the journey is often long, and at times, seems tenuous at best, the victory will be a result of moving inward and reflecting while, simultaneously stepping outside of ourselves to be the best we can be for our loved ones, our neighbors, and especially strangers, to build a more unifying society and strengthen the basic good of humanity.",

            "about": "This is volume 11 of a new series that I've been working on since the beginning of April as a way to provide some internal comfort and peace of mind for those who need it during this time of physical distancing and social isolation.\nThe broadest and biggest viewpoint was recorded on October 9, 2020\nI intended to stream this live like all the other concerts in this series but had some accessibility and technical issues getting the stream to work properly so I wanted to make this one available as soon as possible at name your price for a limited time.\nThe remaining 11 volumes of the series are all performances that have been successfully streamed in the past so if there is a volume 23, it will likely just be a studio release with a title and notated recorded on date since it seems that I can no longer stream accessibly on YouTube due to their new live control room interface.\nMy most sincere thanks to all of you who joined the concerts live or listened when you were able to do so. This has been a delightful experience and 46 live streams isn't a bad run for a series.",

Where do they come from? The dust. Where do they go? The\ngrave. Does blood stir their veins? No: the night wind. What ticks in their head? The worm. What speaks from their mouth? The toad. What sees from their\neye? The snake. What hears with their ear? The abyss between the stars. They sift the human storm for souls, eat flesh of reason, fill tombs with sinners.\nThey frenzy forth....Such are the autumn people.”\nRay Bradbury\nThe Abyss Between The Stars was performed on Youtube October 30, 2020.",

            "about": "This is the sixth volume in an ongoing series of releases taken from YouTube streams that I've done since the Spring of 2021 and into 2022.\nThese have all been carefully mastered for the best sound experience possible so they'll sound much better than the original stream that was on YouTube.\nvolume VI is the 5 hour set I recorded on December 21, 2021 for the winter solstice, serene soundscapes comprised of piano, vocals, field recordings of ice and snow and deep atmospherics of crystalline ethereal beauty.\nSome further elements were added after the original YouTube broadcast to bring out more depth and energy to specific parts of the stream which, in its original form, were lacking in these aforementioned qualities. I feel this gives the whole experience a more cohesive forward moving energy to celebrate the Winter season.",

            "about": "These tracks were recorded between 1991 and 1997 including a rare rehearsal from 1985 when I was a senior at the Florida school for the Deaf and Blind in St. Augustine. Marianna's song is the only one on this album which was not recorded during my years of living in Ohio.\nThe tracks were recorded to cassette directly from my Ensoniq sq1 synthesizer which I had purchased in Steubenville Ohio when I was a graduate student at Franciscan University between August of 1990 and May of 1991.\nDuring the time I lived in the Akron area, which was between 1991 and 1999, I would play many of these songs in coffee houses, restaurants, a friends wedding in her backyard and even a mall or two.\nOriginal notes from studio4632\nWe welcome this excellent album collection from Scott Lawlor, The Lost Early Archives. This album is a step back into the past for Scott, to his musical roots.",

            "about": "This solo piano improvisation was originally recorded on April 15, 2020 as a live stream of an isolation concert that I never included in the 30 volumes of the series on bandcamp.\nIn january of 2023, I imported this session into komplete, made an additional copy of the track which I ran through Molecular from reaktor to create the ethereal ambience heard in the background creating a whole new sounding session which I present to you in 4 parts.\nI'm also including the original isolation concert in it's entirety as it was recorded that night but which has been remastered before adding the effects to it for the previous 4 sections of this album.",

            "about": "This album was recorded over a weekend in October of 2015.\nAll tracks, except 4 and 10 were one-take improvisations using only one sound for each track on the Roland fa08 with no overdubs.\ntrack 4 was originally in two parts but I felt that it flowed better as one and track 10 had some additional piano.\nTrack titles from the Messenger at\ndewinnefol.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/the-messenger/\nreview by Casey Douglass:\n\"Scott Lawlor’s The Messenger is a dark ambient album that for me, brings to mind the notion of some Luciferian being wending his way into the world to whisper his dark message into the ears of the receptive. Its soundscapes are clean and uncluttered, which is what you’d probably imagine when you hear\nthat it was created with one take improvisations.\nI’m not sure how unduly the album art might have influenced me, but the streak of light was a theme that seemed to follow me with each track. As an example,\nThe Heart Transcends Desire has specific tones that aided this. This track features a hanging undulating tone that conjured to mind a spinning disc of some kind, catching the light. It also had a tone that put me very much in mind of an old-fashioned alarm clock ringing, which further added to the effect.\nOther tracks seemed to give me an 80s B-movie horror vibe. When Flesh and Bone Expire is one example of this, the bone-clinking sounds at one point being\njoined by the noise an energy weapon might make as it dissolves a human to powder. This track sounds a bit insectoid in places, and I’m sure I heard the\nthrum of a flying-saucer’s propulsion system at some point.\nPlaying into the whole “Lucifer” notion I first mentioned at the start, a few of the tracks sound a little “churchy” to me. Stepping Past a Graveyard's Stare is one, the sounds and notes sound sonorous and religious somehow, before things quieten at times into a more whimsical soundscape. It’s a bit like\nhearing strains of circus music as it reaches you in your coffin, six feet below the earth.\nThe Messenger is a very dark album that creates some interesting soundscapes with the minimum of fuss. Something all of the tracks seem to have in common\nis the love of waxing and waning sound, the way things build and then quieten, and then evolve into something similar but different. Some do feature the odd “overload” effect of the sound getting very harsh in key places, but for the most part, it’s a smooth ride.\nIf you are a fan of dark ambient that manages to be dark and uncluttered, you’d do well to check out\nThe Messenger.\"\nwww.casey-douglass.com/2018/07/dark-ambient-review-messenger.html",

            "about": "\"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the clouds of war, it is humanity hanging on a cross of iron.\"\nDwight D. Eisenhower\n\"When the rich wage war it's the poor who die.\"\nJean-Paul Sartre\n\"There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.\"\nSun Tzu,\n\"It doesn't make a damned bit of difference who wins the war to someone who's dead.\"\njoseph heller,",

Unlike the first album, this is definitely darker in\ntone. Which gives it even greater atmosphere and intensity. An excellent musical journey! Enjoy!\"",

This collection is comprised\nof two long form tracks and one 12 minute track.\nThe only thing more amazing than this artist's well honed musicality is his prolific, non stop ability to create new music! Scott should be classified as a composer first and foremost. Then an excellent pianist / keyboardist. In this volume, as in all of the Origin albums, he offers lush synths, dark drones, and melodic interludes. Please enjoy Origin 7!",

The Origin Of Supernatural\nAstronomical Phenomena 8.\nLush, dreamy, atmospheric, it is space ambient to dark space ambient at it's finest!.\nScott Lawlor is a master composer. His compositions are not linear or static ; they are free and flowing, lovely deviating meanderings of music and sound\nthat play out so cohesively from beginning to end, like a symphony. An excellent one, at that.\nEnjoy Origins 8 from Scott Lawlor. And we will all look forward to the new volumes ahead!",

            "about": "The firstin the series of deluxe editions of the 25 volumes originally released on studio4632.\nGently remastered and all with additional bonus material.\nIn this first volume, I decided to split the original track into more sensible sections that are obviously different from each other rather than to have it as one long track. This is a formula that I will follow in the remastering of subsequent volumes where the original is one long-form recording and where size limitations by bandcamp prohibit the uploading of the piece as it originated.\nOriginal notes from studio4632\n\"A lovely, lightly dark, experimental, single longform track from Scott Lawlor. An excellent, trippy, hour plus piece, dominated by an array of incredible sounds. Which go from spicy to mellow, loud to subdued, dense to sparse, all seamlessly, and are washed with perfect, unobtrusive fades, and crossfades,\nthroughout.\nA truly excellent longform piece from this very prolific artist! We welcome it and are certain you will enjoy it!\"",

            "about": "This album is an expression of my solidarity in standing with the victims of the horrific shooting at the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando during the early morning hours of June 12, 2016, as well as those suffering from atrocities in other regions of the world such as Beirut, Baghdad, and Syria.\nwe need healing, we need light, we need something to break the curse and the vicious circle humanity has fallen unto..\nMusic is a universal language which we can all understand so to that end, I wanted to do my small part in being a contributor along with other people who may be using that same vehicle to express their own voices of solidarity during this most difficult time. Thank you for listening as we come together in a time of grief and darkness to discover that we can be a force of good and light, to lend our own individual voices to the cause of peace and tranquility to a world that, more than ever, is in such desperate need of both.\nThis music was composed live on  stillstream.com  on January 8, 2016 and when I was listening to the playback, almost brought to tears, I felt this was perfect for expressing the sadness and shock that I feel as a result of another senseless act of barbaric violence against innocence and the eternal consequences of this horror which will forever be visited on those who are left behind.",

Recorded in June of 2015.\nIf memory serves, these were done as a result of mangling shortwave broadcasts since I was doing a lot of that back around that time. This was done shortly after the Journey through the bootes void album which is my most popular album on bandcamp.",

            "about": "This was written between February 25 and March 6, 2024.\n\"We misunderstand St. Paul’s mysticism if we confuse it with its more sensational expressions. As his spiritual life matured his conviction of union with the Spirit of Christ became deeper and more stable. . . . Its keynote is struck in the great saying of his last authentic letter: “I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me” (Philippians 4:13). This statement has long ago been diluted to the pious level, and we have ceased to realize how startling it was and is. But St. Paul used it in the most practical sense, in a letter written from prison after twelve years of superhuman toil, privation, and ill-usage, accompanied by chronic ill-health; years which had included scourgings, stonings, shipwreck, imprisonments, “in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; in weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness” (2 Corinthians 11:26–27). These, and not his spiritual activities and successes alone, are among the memories which would be present in St. Paul’s consciousness when he declared his ability “to do all things.”",

            "about": "In 2017, I released two albums inspired by the early music of Pink Floyd: Obscure Secrets Beyond The Dark Side Of The Cosmic Temple  scottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/obscure-secrets-beyond-the-dark-side-of-the-cosmic-temple  and Revelations From The Lightest Side Of The Secret Moon.\nscottlawlor.bandcamp.com/album/revelations-from-the-lightest-side-of-the-secret-moon\nNow, I present to you, the sessions from the recording of those two albums with all material in the order in which it was originally recorded. This includes all rehearsals, run throughs as well as the final versions of the tracks on the two albums but put together so that you have an experience of the making of both of these albums from conception to conclusion. The two separate albums were originally going to be one but after the advice of a few trusted and good friends, I decided against this approach.\nThis collection is aimed more towards purists and collectors as generally, that is the audience for such a vast collection of material.\nThis is over 7 hours of music and for your reference, I have put indicators for separation of the tracks onto cd, should you desire to utilize such a medium for listening.\ncd1: tracks 1-5\ncd2: tracks 6-11\ncd3: tracks 12-16\ncd4: tracks 17-23\ncd5: tracks 24-32\ncd6: tracks 33-38\ncd7: tracks 39-46",

            "about": "This album was originally released on the Earthmantra label in November of 2016.\nThe three long-form tracks were recorded between 2015-2016and chronicle a journey through the deepest parts of our universe. Starting at the farthest reaches, the listener travels the silent corridors between astral bodies, moving slowly ever closer to home, a slow-evolving set of soundscapes that perfectly encapsulate the feeling of deep-space flight.\nCommentary from The Gateless Gate:\n'Scott Lawlor has tackled every kind of ambient music in his career, even new age. He can do dark and noisy or light and airy. In his work there is a palpable sense of emotion and passion that is often lacking in the work of lesser talents. “The Space Between” is at first listen classic space drone with roots in Steve Roach’s work, long-form pieces that take a long time to develop (a bit like travelling between galaxies, I’d imagine), but allowing the music to wash over him or her, the listener will gradually notice subtle tonal changes that make this experience much more than merely “ambient” in nature; there\nis spiritual information to be absorbed here.'",

            "about": "Notes from Mike Benoit:\n\"This project was a fun experiment for me to have the privilage of creating and watching it grow as each artist sent me their track. I told none of them that they all got the same base drone to work on. No one knew until after they all wrote their piece. My curiosity behind this project was close to the \"telephone game\" kids play where some one whispers something to a person and then they whisper it to the next...so on and so forth, till by the end it's not even the same message anymore. This also floats on the same theory that not everyone actually sees the same thing as the next person..not everyones brain interprets the same image the exact same way. I am quite stoked with what everyone involved here created with what they were given and I love the differences each track has from the others. I hope you all enjoy and every one of us involved in this project thank you for listening and following along as we all push forward with sound art and noise manipulations...Keep an ear out for the next experiment and thank you once again for tooning in. Sit back and enjoy the show\"",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored. These works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests. The sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nOn this album, I wanted to explore the notion of the submissive nature of a client in relation to his mistress.\nBeing on the receiving end of an erotic spanking by a dominatrix who, from time to time, switches roles and allows herself to be the recipient of such\nsexual domination may be a paradox to the submissive who has it in his mind that only one who dominates for a living can deliver such highly charged eroticism.\"",

            "about": "Mike Benoit - The idea for this album was something that came to me one day listening to The Residents \"Commercial Album\" which is certainly one of my favorite albums by them. I thought the limitation of track time must have been a fun little challenge for them, fitting a whole song into a minute just as it was a commercial. I wanted to do the same with ambience and figured I would invite some friends along as well. This is the collected ambient commercials we have created for you. We thank you all for joining our broadcast, please sit back and enjoy the show.\nSpicygod - I joined this project firstly because I love the Residents and also It could be a great way to test an idea I had.\nThe main idea was to use the same simple notes for all tracks created, using various sources and mixes.\nSevenism - My natural approach to music is long slowly shifting pieces. This project pushed me into doing more with less, and provided a welcome reset to think differently about what I do.\nInsectarium - My first thought about this project was that it’s the punk rock of ambient releases, similar to the old punk albums like the Minutemen; short and to the point with no solos.\nI approached this project with the thought, within a minute what would be “my sound.” I tried to compose each track utilizing aspects of sounds and noises I have arranged in the past. Here you will find ritualistic vocals, didgeridoo, remixed field recordings, noise, and straight up ambient keyboards. These 10 tracks span aspects of this vast genre and gives a brief glimpse into who I am as an artist. Join my colony at  insectarium.bandcamp.com\nFabio Keiner - Many Minutes Of Eternity\nPatient - 30 years of ambient music, in just a few minutes. It takes patience to be this Patient.\nScott Lawlor - When Mike approached me about this project, I was intrigued and since John Zorn is one of my inspirations, though it's probably hard to tell with a lot of my music, I remembered what he said about the challenge of compressing an idea into a small space of time. My tracks vary from ambient to a bit of industrial to solo piano.",

Its 3 tracks gradually uncover a world of shadows and dim light, where sounds are the only way to notice the passage of time. The Vast Kelp Forests describes moments of stillness with music and is a contemplative journey through an imaginary world of nature from the perspective of an underwater forest.\nnaviarlab.tumblr.com",

            "about": "This album was composed for the October 24, 2014 edition of the Blind Flight, an ambient podcast that I used to present every Friday night on  stillstream.com  from 2012 until early in 2016. In August of 2017, I remastered the album by adding some extra reverb to enhance the original recording and give it some more space but other than that, the music itself was not altered in any way from that night when it was first presented to the audience of that time.\nMy youngest children are featured at different points on this dark ambient double album, a journey designed to lead you through The Veil Between The Worlds as a part of my annual Halloween release cycle.\nReviewed on the dungeon in deep space:\nthedungeonindeepspace.com/2020/10/31/interstellar-space-special-halloween-review-2-scott-lawlor-the-veil-between-the-worlds/",

            "about": "The harp is known for being an ethereal instrument, and New Age harpist Nicole Anderson spends her days maximizing the instrument’s soothing, angelic resonance. But what happens when the musical journey takes a turn to the darker side of etherealism, to a place steeped in mystery? Each year for Halloween, Nicole teams up with ambient musician Scott Lawlor to take this journey. Together, they create music that may leave a listener conflicted. The sounds are sublimely soothing, and yet have an energy that encourages one to embrace a feeling of being unsettled. What has resulted over the past few years is a collection of soundscapes that serve as an invitation to sit with these unsettled feelings and remain curious of what lies in the darkness. Sit long enough, and you will find your way to deeper levels of beauty and peace.",

            "about": "This is a collection of 15 tracks , inspired by a message on Facebook by Rev. Kimberly Braun from whom I first heard the term Theotokos and found out its meaning.\nAdvent is a time of preparation and stripping away of the interior mind and heart to prepare and make room for the birth of God. To mirror this phenomenon and represent it in the language which I have been called to share, I have composed short, meditative tracks during the month of December, which I hope will also assist you in the emptying of your interior as you prepare for the ultimate joy of the birth of God celebrated on Christmas day.",

            "about": "Spank Hookers is the project name wherein noise works of a sexual and erotic nature will be explored.\nThese works are fetish specific, often touching on very explicit subjects of extreme sexual taboo and bizarre interests.\nThe sound and substance are varied so you won't just hear walls of noise.\nWatersports refers to urine play, or acts that involve urinating in or on another person, or any other activity the involves pee.\nIndividuals who participate in watersports may enjoy being urinated on or urinating on another person's body, including their face, breasts and genitals.\nThese acts are often associated with BDSM. Because it can be extreme in nature (both physically and psychologically) some also consider watersports a form of edgeplay.\nUrinating on another person is seen as symbolic of possession, and it can be used as a form of punishment or humiliation.\nHowever, watersports are not only present in BDSM relationships; in vanilla relationships, people may just enjoy the warm feeling of urine on their bodies or genitals, or be turned on by the sight of their partner urinating.\nThese have been remastered from the original files that I believe were released on an internet label or bandcamp page which no longer exists.",

            "about": "And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will darken the earth in the clear day\"\nAmos Chapter 8, Verse 9\nThe fear, anxiety, disbelief, and yes, even awe that must have been experienced during one of the most pivotal events in human history must have been overwhelming for all. Who could have known that the world would have gone completely dark for three hours after Jesus was nailed to a cross?\nThis is my interpretation of that event, a three hour album which flows seamlessly but is comprised of 4 different dark ambient narratives, utilizing strings, gongs, bells, organs, cello and choirs.\nI have been working on this album since 2015 in between other projects over those 5 years so I hope you will find this to be a stirring emotive experience, one not detailed greatly in the biblical cannon, but an event within the crucifixion story that has been given much speculation over the centuries.",

            "about": "Times escape was originally recorded between 1996 and 1997 when I lived in the Akron Area of Ohio after years of gigging around playing in coffee houses\nand being a member of the Very Special Arts group of that city.\nMy inspirations for the album range from Klaus Schulze, Richard Burmer, Tangerine Dream but especially the sleep concerts of Robert Rich. I had received one such concert\non cassette tape from a friend in the mail and after listening to it while I slept at night, I wanted to try my hand at composing space music. I had long\nbeen a fan of such artists as Jonn Serrie, Tangerine Dream and the like so the Times Escape collection was my first attempt at composing a more ambient\nflowing work.\nI came up with the title after listening to the entire set of tracks because I felt that a sense of time was lost while listening so that title seemed\nto fit the mood of the music.\nIt was recorded exclusively on an Ensoniq SQ-1 synthesiser that I had for years and the sequences were recorded to cassette tape. at the time I didn't\nknow anything about recording audio on the computer so cassette was the way I captured my ideas and songs. In that regard, the collection has a lost archive\nfeel to it with the imperfections of the medium since it was years before I transferred the cassette to a digital format.",

This album is a combination of sounds from the MTR transit system over there combined with older sounds of our kitchen remodel that took place in 2017. Strelokk processed the original recordings, sent me back those files and I further mangled and manipulated them, sending him the results. He added additional elements from the field recordings and mastered the album.",

            "about": "Nominated for ambient album of 2017 by One World Music Radio and Included in Kathy's list of favorites for 2018:\nmainlypiano.com/favorites/kathys-favorites-2018\nOn November 7, 2017, I received a phone call from my mother who told me through tears that hospice was with my brother Joe and he wasn't waking up. I took a flight out that afternoon to spend what little precious time there was to be had with him before he lost the courageous battle he had been fighting with a rare aggressive form of sarcoma, a cancer that had spread to multiple organs throughout his body in less than a year.\nOn November 16, exactly one month before his 47th birthday, my baby brother went home to heaven to congregate with the angels and other relatives our family has tragically lost over time. This album is a tribute to the memory of a great man who was a loving husband, a courageous brother and father who will eternally watch over his two children for all the rest of their days on Earth.\nEach of the 5 songs on this album, which were composed between November 25th and 29th, has a story behind it and they were written to convey a sense of the tears and heartache that we all have experienced as a result of this great man being taken from us way too soon.\nWe mourn, not for him because he is no longer in pain but for our loss as we are left behind to live our lives, a little emptier because of his brave journey home.\nSacred Ground was written to convey a sense of stillness and quiet in his home for the last week and a half of his life. The people from hospice told us that he was in transition and that the living room where he was sleeping was sacred ground. I felt that the organ was the instrument of choice to reflect what had become a sacred space for his journey home.\nWhispering voices was inspired by what happened one night when my mother was sitting with Joe. She thought she heard some whispered or muffled voices, and thinking it was his wife or the television in the other room, got up to look around. There was no other sound in the room and yet she kept hearing the voices. Being a spiritual person, she would tell me the next day that it was the angels saying they were ready for him.\nMomentary presence was improvised to convey my own experience of a fleeting supernatural encounter as I sat by Joe's bed side one afternoon. I thought I felt someone standing off to the left of the chair I was in and when I called out \"who's there\", no one answered but I felt as if there was someone physically present for a brief moment.\nTransition, the title track of the album, represents my interpretation of the angels calling him home, to a world of no pain, one where he will be eternally free from the bonds of mortality.\nThe Last Goodbye was written to convey my sadness at saying farewell to Joe for the last time and ensuring him that it was okay for him to go home. It was a very emotional tear-filled couple of minutes for me as anyone who has lost a loved one can testify.\nJoe, you will be forever missed and I know in my heart, that part of myself that is intuitive and beyond logic, that you are watching over all of those you have loved and held dear in your previous life.\nReview from Noise Beneath the snow:\nOne of the amazing things about ambient/dark ambient music is that it often helps paint a picture and put into perspective that which is simply indescribable\nin words.  Such is the case here in our offering now.  Moreover, indescribable is surely a word the artist encountered when it came to the theme behind\nthis album.\nTransition is the new release from ambient composer Scott Lawlor.  The theme of the album revolves around the emotional dynamics involved in the passing\nof his brother.\nTransition is a beautiful record containing 5 tracks, each one conveying an emotion or specific situation the artist experienced in his mourning; The stillness\nbefore the transition, the feeling of the presence of a loved one after they’ve passed away, the heartache of saying “Farewell.”\nTransition definitely has a more intimate and personal feel to it as opposed to many ambient releases which seem to drive the listener into the ether or\nthe subterranean.  Moreover, while some ambient albums appear seamless from start to finish (take for example Steve Roach or Robert Rich’s work), Transition\nquite successfully reads like chapters in a book, and one that is deeply personal, mind you.  When is the last time you heard a church organ sound on an\nambient release?  Scott Lawlor ignores a lot of the rules of ambient music.  But then again, there is no “rule book” to coming to grips with the loss\nof a loved-one.\nLoss of a loved one is something we’ve all experienced as humans.  Some of us are further blessed with the capability to transform our sorrows into sound\nor words and perhaps inspire listeners or readers in the process.  From listening to Transition, it’s obvious that it must be a painful journey for Scott\nLawlor.  But I suppose it’s a positive thing that there are ambient albums out there that take you through more personal territories and not those located\nin the ether or subterranean.\nnoisebeneaththesnow.com/2017/12/17/scott-lawlor-transition-album-review-ambient-drone/\n\"Transition has to be one of the most meaningful albums you will have heard this year, this is the Transition of the human body and the continuation of the journey of souls.\nI mentioned in my last review of Scott’s work, Look Unto the Heavens, of his brothers fight against Cancer, while the fight maybe over, the transition now takes place, and in this extremely honourable and respectful album Scott achieves something that no one in humanity, as far as I know, has done, literally creating a soundtrack for that moment that we all must face at some stage in our lives.\nScott Lawlor’s sense of need in this piece is extreme, on Sacred Ground there is energy of that change taking place, with the last breath gone, the soul begins to move away from the human form and into freedom and of course free from pain. The organ like keyboards here have such a loving reverence that they manifest a slowing down of time, perhaps even removing time itself from our reality.\nThe depth in this piece is so vast it is incalculable; it is like walking through a doorway that leads to a realm that is beyond human comprehension, and this continuum of sound and tone, is one that has been with us since the very moment the first star flickered. Sacred Ground as a starting point is a wonderfully poignant arrangement played entirely from the emotions, and beautifully so.\nThe journey of souls continues and we find ourselves cocooned on this voyage with him, we can now listen to and witness an amazingly ethereal composition entitled Whispering Voices. Lawlor’s artistic truth here offers up a vista of a completely peaceful transition, one that has started to let go of all things mortal and such allows the ether to guide his way along the beam.\nWhispering Voices as a track, is electronic mastery like you have probably not heard since the late, but great, Isao Tomita. Time seems an irrelevance now as we float with the synths and enjoy the swirling colours of this quite outstanding voyage of reconnection.\nWe now find our musical selves at the doorway to the many answers and questions we have had, and we find that through Momentary Presence (Featuring Wings of an Angel) we can achieve much by letting go and allowing those wings of love to encircle us.\nMusically this is up there with artists like Jonn Serrie and Kevin Kendle, there is a wonderfully universal energy about this one that carries such an empowering and happy message for us all, that all is going to be well and more so, all is as it should be. This is truly one of those compositions that you will be deeply moved by, touched perhaps by an angel, touched by the one thing that could unite us all, unconditional love.\nThe journey has continued through a myriad of musical dimensions, many connections have been made, and realisations discovered, and at this point the Transition can be completed. This is the grand title track and one that is so amazing, it may even move you to tears. There is built within the construction on this piece a layer of peace, a bed of tranquillity that is so free and empowering, all fear and pain has now melted into a vortex of love.\nThis grand opus of nearly half an hour is the ultimate long form composition that many electronic artists would not dare to do, but with Lawlor’s skill set and heart felt honesty, this is truly a composition that not only highlights the actual energy of the final transition, but delivers to us a piece of music that is filled with dimensions of sublime synths, that literally create a whole new reality for the soul.\nThe final offering on the album is called, and quite poignantly, The Last Goodbye. We can now end our journey with the musician and drift back to our realm of reality. The tones of the piano manifest a mood of finality, of a change that has been completed. This has to be the most beautiful piece off the album, one can feel through the keys a true release has occurred, and a oneness of spirit has been achieved. Scott Lawlor has gifted us the perfect finishing movement, and we can through its harmonic convergences feel a sense of happy completion.\nTransition by Scott Lawlor is one of those special albums that is created from a divine connection that few will ever feel, this is true soul music, each track on this release has been crafted, but by being connected, by allowing an open heart to flourish musically. Ambient genius, of course, but this is much more than that, this is one of the most beautiful and emotional releases in this genre by a mile for many a year, and Lawlor should be proud of this cathartic musical manifestation that he has allowed himself to create.\"\nReview by Steve Sheppard, One World Music Radio\nwww.mixcloud.com/OWM/audio-review-for-scott-lawlor-and-transition/\n\"If you are into soulful, thought provoking and consciousness expanding ambient music, Scott Lawlor is a composer and artist who needs to be on your musical\nradar. His vast body of work will keep your ears attuned for a long time to both your inner spirit and that indefinable “other” in the Universe. A visit\nto his incredible Bandcamp page  (scottlawlor.bandcamp.com/music)  reveals a staggering 209 releases in this genre. Two of his latest demanding our\ndeepest attention, Look Unto the Heavens and Transition, are insightful musical-philosophical reflections and deeply therapeutic instrumental pieces. Both\nwere lovingly  crafted as a response to his beloved brother Joe’s suffering with stage 4 cancer - and his ultimate transition beyond this mortal coil to\nmore heavenly realms free from these human limitations.\nLawlor pointed me towards Look Unto the Heavens as the poetic “open door,” a rich and expansive inner search for a meaning to suffering that sets up Transition,\na multi-faceted five track meditation he composed in late November 2017, less than two weeks after Joe departed. Look to the Heavens used its offbeat lengthy\ntitles to tackle some of these heavy mysteries comprising the eternal “Why.” These included “Clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones\nand sinews” and “our days on earth are but a shadow.” Some titles read like longer sayings or verses of poetry. The titles of the five tracks comprising\nTransition are shorter, crisper, perhaps a reflection of how the ceasing noise and clamor surrounding a painful end to this life gives way to something\ngentler that needs fewer words to express.\nExplaining the overarching narrative behind Transition, Scott says, “Each track has a story behind it and they were written to convey a sense of tears\nand heartache that we all have experienced as a result of a great man being taken from us way too soon. We mourn not for him because he is no longer in\npain, but for our loss as we are left behind to live our lives, a little…more.”\nWith ambient music, it’s best to let the sonic landscape take us on a journey and dictate impressions of the emotions we experience along the way. On “Sacred\nGround,” a 17 minute piece conveying quiet, stillness and reverence, Lawlor uses the organ to transport us not only to church but to the doors of the knowable\nyet unknowable realms its human doctrines point to. Lawlor says that his brother’s hospice workers called his home during those final weeks “sacred ground”\n– and indeed anyplace on the planet can become that during the time leading to our final transition. Listening to this piece with our eyes closed, and\nusing it to tap into our own memories, we can contemplate the lives of our own loved ones who have passed even as we connect with Lawlor’s own sense  of\nmourning,  discovery and mystery.\nThe more spiritual among us will connect immediately with the ethereal formless voices they hear in rising chorus at the start of “Whispering Voices” –\na ten minute reflection on a moment when Lawlor’s  mother  was sitting with Joe and heard whispered or muffled voices, which she intuited must be angels\ngathering. The track will comfort those among us open-minded enough to who believe in such things. It’s as if they are joining forces around our loved\none’s bed, helping the dying and the living experience a peaceful transition. The improvised atmospheric energy of “Momentary Presence (Featuring wings\nof an angel)” ranges from long stretches of intensely bright light and soaring to quieter, gentler passages of moodier reflection.\nLawlor wrote this piece based on a fleeting supernatural encounter as he sat by Joe’s bed one day. He felt a presence, and we can almost visualize the\nfigure glowing then dimming as the track eases on. The title track “Transition” is a dynamics-rich 27 minute musical essay that defies easy description,\nwhich is natural when one is digging deeper than ever before into our human experience to understand just how souls move from this plane to the next. Lawlor\nmodulates his synth to create sustained notes full of wonder, murkiness, clarity and peace – for his family and for Joe, who is now part of eternity.\n“The Last Goodbye” is the album’s sole piano composition, a moody, thoughtful meditation that showcases Lawlor’s sense of melodic beauty and, for category’s\nsake, is more mainstream “new age” than “space ambience.” It’s an emotional, tear-filled farewell that speaks to Joe as if to say it’s okay that he is\nnow home while addressing his survivors - and telling them it’s okay to mourn for now, but someday there will be a joyous reunion in the other realm. Overall,\nTransition is an profound, incredibly insightful work, and hopefully will be an open door to Lawlor’s unique musical universe and its vast musical and spiritual adventures.\"\nreview by Jonathan Widran\nwww.jwvibe.com\n\"Transition is the second in a three-part series of ambient albums by keyboardist/composer Scott Lawlor. Composed and recorded between mid-2017 and May 2018, the trilogy began when Lawlor’s younger brother, Joe, was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer that had metastasized to several organs of his body. The first album, Look Unto the Heavens, was, in part, about finding the strength to deal with something like this and how, when it is desperately needed, strength can whisper to the surface despite the noise and chaos of everyday life. Transition began when Lawlor received a phone call from his mother telling him that hospice was with Joe and that he wasn’t waking up. Joe passed away about ten days later, and this album “is a tribute to the memory of a great man who was a loving husband, a courageous brother and father who will eternally watch over his two children for all the rest of their days on Earth.” (quoted from Scott Lawlor’s notes about the album.)\nTransition consists of five pieces that were composed in a five-day period shortly after Joe’s passing, and each tells its own story. All five were composed “to convey a sense of the tears and heartache that we all have experienced as a result of this great man being taken from us way too soon.” (again quoting Lawlor’s album notes.) The pieces range from just under ten minutes to twenty-seven minutes. Although the music was born out of tragic loss, it is soothing and often ethereal. Where Look Unto the Heavens plays as one long piece, the five pieces on Transition are distinct, each telling of a different experience. It is my sincerest hope that in composing this music, Scott Lawlor was given some of the healing comfort that these albums will undoubtedly give others.\nTransition begins with “Sacred Ground,” which was intended to convey the sense of stillness and quiet that was in Joe’s home for the last ten days of his life. The hospice caregivers told the family that Joe was in transition and that the room where he was sleeping was sacred ground. The use of the organ for this piece emphasizes the spirituality of the experience while offering peace and solace. “Whispering Voices” is very ethereal with both male and female choral voices (no lyrics). The piece was inspired by an experience Scott’s mother had while sitting with Joe one night and hearing voices but finding that no one was there. She interpreted this as the angels telling her that they were ready for Joe. The voices are otherworldly and mysterious, but also comforting and quiet. “Momentary Presence” was improvised to convey Scott’s sensing a physical presence as he sat at Joe’s bedside one afternoon. Darkness occasionally weaves in and out of the piece, but there is no fear. The title track represents Scott’s interpretation of the angels calling Joe home to a place with no pain. This twenty-seven minute piece is serene and dreamlike, and makes me think of many paintings of mortals ascending through the clouds to their new heavenly home as beams of light break through the clouds. “The Last Goodbye” expresses Scott’s sadness at bidding his brother farewell for the last time. Performed with a piano sound and lots of reverb, the emotions are very deep and very tangible. About halfway into the piece, lighter shimmering instrumentation enters, beautifully expressing that Joe’s transition is complete and that he is now at peace.\nTransition is an amazing and deeply affecting musical journey through one of the most difficult experiences we humans can have. Many thanks to Scott Lawlor for sharing such a personal time in his life with us. Highly recommended!\"\nKathy Parsons\nMainlyPiano.com",

            "about": "It was a clear night in the dead of Winter as the little girl peered out of the window of her bedroom. It was midnight and she was supposed to be asleep hours ago but she was so excited about the last day of school before Christmas break that her mind just wouldn't settle down.\nSince she couldn't sleep, she got out of her bed, went over to the window and looked out at the moonless night. The stars were bright this night as she was transfixed on the constellations and other patterns they made in the sky.\nShe had learned at an early age from her mother, the importance of pattern recognition and it was an attribute at which she accelerated in astonishing speed, recognizing patterns in her environment that other people either couldn't see or didn't dare to imagine.\nAnd so it was with the stars. She observed things beyond science, things that, if she had told other people, they would lock her away somewhere far away, as they would have the belief that she had a profound disorder of the mind.\nShe stood transfixed, gazing intently at the slowly shifting patterns in the heavens and instinctively knew that the world she inhabited would soon be very different, if it even existed at all soon after this cold and chilly night gave way to the light of one of the last days of this planets existence.\nNox Intempesta is the project of myself and Sevenism begun this year on the ambient online forum at  www.ambientonline.org.\nsevenism.bandcamp.com\nsoundcloud.com/sevenism\nMinor Clipping in places is intentional.",

Hair becomes erotic and sexually arousing to the individual. Throughout history, hair has always been viewed as a form of eroticism, vanity, and an essential part of beauty. Often, trichophilia is experienced around head hair, but it can also be extended to hair on other parts of the body and fur. Further, the individual may have preferences for hairstyle, wetness of hair or hair color.",

The identities of the subjects remain classified to this day and it is surmised, by reading the unpublished journals of the top medical officials, writings which were discovered by random chance, that all 6 subjects died as a result of these clinical trials.\nNox Intempesta is the project of myself and Sevenism begun in 2015 on the ambient online forum at  ambientonline.org.\nsevenism.bandcamp.com\nsoundcloud.com/sevenism",

            "about": "Aural Films welcomes a new release by artist Scott Lawlor who has composed a long form piece inspired by the New Testament verses Matthew chapter 12: 43 through 45. The main theme of the piece was originally composed in 1991, but reworked in 2012 to include expansive organ sections inspired by a piece by John Zorn called the hermetic organ.\nMatthew chapter 12 verses43 through 45:\n43 - \"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest, but he finds none.\n44 - Then he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.\n45 - Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation.\"",

            "about": "This album was inspired by the New Testament verses Matthew chapter 12\" 43\nthrough 45.\n43 - \"When the unclean spirit has gone out of a man, he passes through waterless places seeking rest, but he finds none.\n44 - Then he says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when he comes he finds it empty, swept, and put in order.\n45 - Then he goes and brings with him seven other spirits more evil than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man becomes worse than the first. So shall it be also with this evil generation.\"\nThe main theme was originally composed in 1991, but reworked in 2012 to include expansive organ sections inspired by the hermetic organ by John Zorn. It was originally released on the aural Films label in January of 2014 but has been remastered for this new edition. a companion piece composed for organ, partly inspired by the work of French organist and composer Olivier Messiaen, was played live on stillstream.comm on September 4, 2015 and is included here for the first time.\nSo shall it be also with this evil generation was composed in August of 2017 as a final track to the album.",

            "about": "“There was a magic about the sea. People were drawn to it. People wanted to love by it, swim in it, play in it, look at it. It was a living thing that as as unpredictable as a great stage actor: it could be calm and welcoming, opening its arms to embrace it's audience one moment, but then could explode with its stormy tempers, flinging people around, wanting them out, attacking coastlines, breaking down islands. It had a playful side too, as it enjoyed the crowd, tossed the children about, knocked lilos over, tipped over windsurfers, occasionally gave sailors helping hands; all done with a secret little chuckle”\n― Cecelia Ahern, The Gift",

            "about": "Wistful Winter was an idea that I had when I first thought about combining elements of two previous songs which were released in 2020 and 2021. This initial concept of the song started out being a more electronic version but as I added elements to it, it no longer felt like the right direction to go so I decided to abandon this approach and create something completely different.\nThe 4 versions of this song were written between November 18 and November 30, 2023 and include the aforementioned electronic version whereupon I came up with more ideas to make it better.",

            "about": "“Where is the freedom in all this? Nowhere! There is no choice here, no final decision.\nAll decisions concerning networks, screens, information or communication are serial in character, partial, fragmentary, fractal.\nA mere succession of partial decisions, a microscopic series of partial sequences and objectives, constitute as much the photographer's way of proceeding as that of Telecomputer Man in general, or even that called for by our own most trivial television viewing.\nAll such behaviour is structured in quantum fashion, composed of haphazard sequences of discrete decisions. The fascination derives from the pull of the black box, the appeal of an uncertainty which puts paid to our freedom.\nAm I a man or a machine? This anthropological question no longer has an answer. We are thus in some sense witness to the end of anthropology, now being conjured away by the most recent machines and technologies.\nThe uncertainty here is born of the perfecting of machine networks, just as sexual uncertainty (Am I a man or a woman? What has the difference between the sexes become?) is born of increasingly sophisticated manipulation of the unconscious and of the body, and just as science's uncertainty about the status of its object is born of the sophistication of analysis in the microsciences.”\n― Jean Baudrillard",

There are also other great drones from the Alice project to be heard as well so I hope you'll explore those, also available on the Buddhist on Fire label.",
