            "about": "\"Born out of a common interest in the repetitive, challenging and intense the three-headed dragon Organ of Corti is a new collaboration project between Swedish sound experts Joachim Nordwall (IDEAL Records, Gagmen), Mattias Gustafsson (Altar of Flies) and Dan Johansson (Sewer Election, Enhet för Fri Musik). Inspired by tape music from the 60s, minimal music, early industrial and collective creativity their sound is unique and unheard of. Organ of Corti is about hearing, about how to be affected through sound and the power of reaching other states of consciousness through composition and deep listening.\"",
            "credits": "released May 10, 2022\nOrgan Of Corti is the new collaboration of Swedish masters Dan Johansson (Sewer Election), Mattias Gustafsson (Altar of Flies), and Joachim Nordwall (iDEAL, The Skull Defekts). Each artist's individual brilliance shines forth in Organ Of Corti, but this is much more than the sum of its parts. \"Auris\" takes the familiar murkiness of Johansson and Gustafsson, injects a healthy dose of Nordwall's crisp electronics, and assembles everything into a series of spacious, brilliantly executed tracks. Loops, ambient sounds, electronic drones, noisier flourishes… there is plenty to explore in each track, but “Auris” never feels rushed or busy. Each sound is expertly placed for maximum impact. A phenomenal debut CD from three of Sweden’s finest.",

            "about": "“[Det Finns Ett Hjärta Som För Dig] is one of the most wonderful albums I’ve ever heard from Sweden. People will try hard to figure this one out in the future. A comment on a welfare system collapsing? Just a glimpse into the creators’ childhood memories of rainy summers cut-jumping back and forth to scenes of cases of 3.5% beer smashed on the concrete behind the Sibylla, neverending confirmation camps, virginities forever lost and trimmed mopeds disappearing in the morning fog? The letting go’s and the joys and the sorrows of it all.”\n- Efraim F. Ponteus, May 1st 2017",

            "about": "Fanaticus is the new full length album from Organ Of Corti, the trio of Dan Johansson (Sewer Election), Mattias Gustafsson (Altar of Flies), and Joachim Nordwall (iDEAL, The Skull Defekts). A significant evolution from 2022's Auris, also released on New Forces, Fanaticus blends tape loops and analog synths into a claustrophobic exhibition of tense and curious sound. Each of these seven tracks has a depth to it that demands repeated listening. Fanaticus deftly weaves together the subtle nuances of scratchy tape heads and twitching electronics. Machines hum, sputter, and crackle as they fail; they are simultaneously reborn and given new life through the particular alchemy that is Organ Of Corti. The pinnacle of Swedish experimental sound",

            "about": "79 BC: the erup­tion of Mount Vesuvius cov­ers the ancient Roman city of Pompei with tons of ash. All of its inhab­i­tants die and are buried for­ever. The imprints of their remains have been pre­served for cen­turies. Today one can still gaze at the plas­ter cask of a per­ished dog, as if some­body did not want him to be for­got­ten. Destruction and still­ness are united in ​‘POMPEI. Impronte’ (ca.1888), Giorgio Sommer’s photo of this dog. B.A.A.D.M. pre­sented this iconic image to Sewer Election and Leda, as a source of inspi­ra­tion for what now became ​‘Maar’. Working together for this album under their solo monikers, sound artists Dan Johansson and Sofie Herner already col­lab­o­rated on some of the most cap­ti­vat­ing Swedish exper­i­men­tal releases of recent years with their work as Neutral and as part of Enhet För Fri Musik. Like the Pompei dog seems reach­ing to his tail, becom­ing a sym­bol of infi­nite being, this record emerges as a closed world or a vac­uum, with two side-long tracks inter­minably refer­ring to each other. With ​‘Maar’ Sewer Election and Leda cre­ated a sound cask, an iso­lated sonic uni­verse with no begin­ning nor end.",

            "about": "Sewer Election started blessing the undergound noise scene around 2002 and has since released tons of stuff, from harsh noise to raw musique concrète-like things and tape works. ”Sweet Distractions” is a long piece sitting comfortably in the corner of his more laid back and ambient works. Sounds a bit like William Basinski never cleaned his reel to reel machines. Broken, beautiful and strange in the best possible way.\nUnreleased tape loop album from 2007. Sweet Distractions was an early attempt at singular tape loop composition and one of the key recordings, next to Kassettmusik, pushing the project into more crude tape manipulation and lo-fi concrete abstractions.",
