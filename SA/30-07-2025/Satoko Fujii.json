Satoko and Alister began to collaborate on this project early in 2020 and develop ideas for co-written piano duet pieces, meeting occasionally on the internet to rehearse and explore. This album is the result of three recording sessions in September 2021. It is the second duo release by Fujii and Spence, following on from their piano and fender rhodes album intelsat (2018, ASM007).\n‘this is the sound of genuine discovery, founded upon decades of experience but unfettered by habit.’\nBill Meyer, Dusted Magazine (review of intelsat)",

            "about": "Cooperative Quartet Kaze and Ikue Mori\nRelease Innovative New CD, Crustal Movement on March 17, 2023\nAlbum is a visceral, richly textured hybrid of pre-recorded music files exchanged during pandemic and live performance.\n“[Their music is] a well-judged amalgam of adventurous and empathetic ensemble playing, and striking individual flights,”—John Sharpe, All About Jazz\n“So intriguing that you’ll listen to it as music, not noise, and you’ll start to think about the relationship between music and sound and then . . . you’ll be hooked–just as I am.”—Marc Phillips, The Vinyl Anachronist\nOn Crustal Movement (March 17, 2023; Circum/Libra), the pioneering musician Ikue Mori on laptop electronics joins Kaze – the cooperative quartet featuring Japanese composer-pianist Satoko Fujii and trumpeter Natsuki Tamura plus French trumpeter Christian Pruvost and drummer Peter Orins – to move in new directions as they explore innovative ways of making music. On their first album together since 2020’s incendiary Sand Storm, these five sonic explorers weave together pre-recorded music files and live performance. The results are as exciting, interactive, and detailed as if they had recorded entirely live.\nIn the usual collective spirit of the group, each member contributes compositions for the recording. Knowing that this would be a largely remote effort, they each planned out pieces that were more like written outlines than musical scores. “We all composed a structure and made a blueprint,” Fujii said. “In most cases we made a chart on paper, not on music paper. The blueprints have time durations and instrumentation and some instructions like ‘play fast’ or ‘play quietly.’”\nFujii, Tamura, and Mori then proceeded to follow the compositional guidelines and send music files of their performances back and forth around the world via the Internet. Pruvost and Orins then added a new twist to the file-exchange procedure. “Instead of adding individually to the sound files, they did a very interesting thing,” Fujii said. “They played along with our files at a concert in Lille and recorded it. Ikue, Natsuki and I were not in the concert, but our recordings were. We try many different ways to make music!”\nThe combination of live and pre-recorded interactions, guided by compositions designed to accommodate the remotely situated players, results in uncommonly fluid and naturally developing music that belies the circumstances under which it was made. For instance, the Pruvost and Orins composition “Masoandro Mitsoka” guides the quintet from a quiet introduction into a kaleidoscopic group improvisation with acoustic and electronic colors swirling around a dialog between the trumpets. Ikue Mori’s “Motion Dynamics” sets up complex ensemble give-and-take that continuously changes the shape and flow of the piece. Fujii’s “Crustal Movement” establishes an irregular rhythm that pushes and pulls the group along a zig-zag path into a roiling mass that throws off sparks of color. Tamura’s “Rolle Cake” is a subtle tone poem that glides easily through subdued, almost lyrical passages and rumbling, anxious moments. The detail in the group interactions, the organic development of each piece, and the lovely flashes of surprise and discovery are exceptional throughout.\n“The music may be quieter than when Kaze plays live,” Fujii noted. “We have a tendency to heat up so much and so easily when we’re on stage together. That’s harder to do when we’re remote, but we can still be exploring and intense.”",

            "about": "Pianist-composer Satoko Fujii hasn’t let the global pandemic slow her down. She’s recorded solo and duet albums at home and made others by swapping sound files over the internet. Now comes Mosaic, her new album with her trio This Is It!, her first pandemic album made in real time with one band member in a remote location. With drummer Takashi Itani 400 miles away in a Tokyo suburb and Fujii and trumpeter Natsuki Tamura at home together in Kobe, they overcame technical and artistic challenges to capture the buoyant, interactive spirit of their live performances. “This pandemic pushed me to find new ways to create that I have never tried before,” Fujii says. “Nothing can stop us from making music!”\nFujii missed the opportunity to record the band live last year. “I had two shows in 2020, both at Pit Inn. The first day, I played with my Tokyo Trio and that was recorded and released as Moon on the Lake. On the second day, I played with This is It!, but I didn’t record it. I really regret that now.”\nHowever, from the beginning of the pandemic, the trio rehearsed online several times and enjoyed it. “I can make music exchanging files online,” Fujii says, “but this trio plays spontaneous improvisation and needs the inspiration that we get when we play together. So we decided to record a session on the internet.”\nThey discovered that it was not the same as performing and recording in person. For one thing, internet connections can sometimes delay the transmission of sound and they needed to compensate for that when it happened. Fujii found there was another challenge as well. “I had to consciously concentrate more on listening,” she said. “If we play in the same room, listening is as natural as breathing, I’m almost unaware that I’m doing it. But on the internet, it was not like breathing. My ears worked like listening carefully to another language; it required a little extra effort. But we found we could make music in this way.”\nIndeed they can. The album bubbles over with the joy of music making, the sheer delight they take in challenging and supporting one another. They play with fierce urgency on “Habana’s Dream,” feeding off each other in a multi-layered ensemble performance. It features Fujii at her most percussive and explosive, with Tamura and Itani alternating brilliant flashes of sound and color with darker, grittier passages. “Dieser Zug,” featuring Itani on vibes, is a lovely construction of contrasting parts. In one section, Itani’s sparkling vibraphone dances around Fujii’s percussive note clusters as Tamura weaves soft low tones between them. It’s a stellar display of the ways in which the trio interlocks their ideas with compelling clarity and balance. The trio initially uses the melody of Fujii’s “Kumazemi” to guide their improvising, but they gradually move far afield from it, exploring timbre and sound as they build tension and momentum. “Sleepless Night” is a dark tone poem, with Itani’s metallic clicking and clattering making a disturbing racket as Fujii and Tamura engage in a troubled dialogue. “76 RH” takes the album out with a burst of energy, blending Fujii’s composition seamlessly with full-on free improvisation. If working virtually posed challenges for this group, it doesn’t show.",

            "about": "Pianist Satoko Fujii and bassist Joe Fonda deepen their dialogue on a new duet album Mizu\n\"Not only is Mizu the best work this duo has produced, but it holds promise for what has quickly become an exceptional creative partnership. While Fujii emphasizes that the pair are operating on level footing, there is no doubt that her piano work, here confined mostly to the outside of the instrument, is among the finest of her career. A terrific album\" - Karl Ackermann, All About Jazz\n\"This one is truly OUTstanding!\" - Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtonwn Music Gallery\n\"The three improvs account for nearly an hour-long journey that will have you reaching for the repeat button at the set's conclusion\". - Peter Thelen, Exposè\n\"This music is quite a trip, one well worth taking. It is music of tremendous imagination and power. Not a touch of “soft jazz” or “ambient jazz” in sight!\" - Lynn René Bayley, The Art Music Lounge\n\"Their common improjazz is avant-garde and at one time difficult to access and easily understandable. It is at a certain level of abstraction, but the individual instrumentation also makes it immediately available, fascinating and in moments, definitely touching. Light, airy, soothing\" - Ivan Rod, Ivan Rod's Blog\n“The degree of intimate listening and deep exchange between Fujii’s piano and the woody, natural-sounding bass of Fonda is breathtaking.” — Robert Bush, NBC San Diego\n“The conversation is intuitive, at times seemingly telepathic — and it creates an enormous amount of drama and joy.” — Steve Feeney, The Arts Fuse\nOn Mizu, pianist-composer Satoko Fujii and bassist Joe Fonda pick up where they left off two years ago when they released their first duo album, titled simply Duet, to rave reviews. Mizu, recorded live on a 2017 European tour, finds them delving deeper into their musical connection. There’s a surprise around every corner as these two play with even greater emotional abandon, lyricism, and freedom. The album will be released July 27, 2018 via Long Song.\nAt the urging of a festival producer in Europe, Fonda contacted Fujii in 2015 to see if she’d like to get together to play. They eventually were able to coordinate their busy international performing schedules for a New England tour later in the year. They managed two other concerts before their next opportunity to play together for an extended period emerged, on a 2017 four-city European tour. The tour produced the music on this new duet CD, as well as Triad, a trio recording with Italian saxophonist Gianni Mimmo released earlier this year as part of Fujii’s 60th birthday celebration.\nDespite a lengthy gap between performances, the chemistry between Fujii and Fonda has grown. “I find that the more we play together, the more free we feel to take risks. We talk to each other in music,” says Fujii.\nFonda agrees. “Now that we've had a chance to play together more, the vocabulary and the possibilities that we’re using have expanded,” he says. “We trust and respect each other, that’s where the freedom comes from.”\nThe freedom results in exhilarating music that is both inviting and challenging. On “Rik Bevernage,” a dedication to the late Belgian concert producer and label owner, there’s an elastic give and take between Fujii and Fonda as they exchange ideas and develop them. Sharp percussive motifs give way to flowing waves of music and then to sounds of unusual timbre. Fonda sounds especially inspired on this track, joyfully springing off in his own direction one minute, then curling around Fujii’s piano inventions like a vine. “Long Journey” also finds bass and drums in perfect sync, playing in parallel without ever directly echoing or following the other. “Mizu” is focused and unhurried as it winds its way through one fascinating musical landscape after another. Throughout the album, the pianist and bassist are co-equal creators, with no sense of a leader and an accompanist, just two voices intertwined in a profound dialogue.\n“I would not get the same inspiration from Joe if he played only like an accompanist,” Fujii says. “For me instrumentation and traditional soloist-accompanist roles are not that important. Who I play with and the quality of their ideas and willingness to work together are far more important to me.”\n“I feel free to play whatever I want and so does she,” Fonda says. He points to a moment on the title track to illustrate what he means. “There is a place where I start singing. I remember all of a sudden Satoko started playing something that sounded like opera to me. And I said to myself, wow, someone's gotta sing—and that's what I did. This is the kind of freedom we've arrived at.”",

            "about": "The second CD in a series of compelling releases featuring the lady of avant jazz Satoko Fujii and bass giant Joe Fonda, now with the addition of sax soprano master Gianni Mimmo. The result of a totally improvised one day studio session, \"Triad\" is a marvellous achievement in daring and spectacular avant jazz music.\nREVIEWS\nBest of 2018 – Kevin Reilly, Downtown Music Gallery\nHonorable Mention, Best New Releases of 2018 – Laurence Donohue-Greene, New York City Jazz Record\n4-stars – Neri Pollastri, All About Jazz\n4.5-stars – Antonio Poscic, The Free Jazz Collective\n“This unique trio seems to have evolved out of a series of chance encounters and it succeeds with completely original ideas and musicianship.” – Karl Ackermann, All About Jazz\n“The mood oscillates between deep introspection and intense communion, all three musicians capable of lyricism, without falling into sentimentalism…a successful plunge into the unknown, as well as a reminder that free improvisation is at its best when musicians can establish an immediate connection and are fully committed to a project.” – Alain Drouot, DownBeat\n“The works attain a level of beauty that is beyond the limits of anything written or improvised.” – Raul da Gama, Jazz da Gama\n“You can’t have too much of this kind of good experimental thing.” – Steve Feeney, Arts Fuse\n4-stars: “She's accomplished in every aspect of jazz, from free to noted and folk to avant-garde. Her creative energies burn as brightly as that of David Murray in the 1990s, and Ivo Perelman in this new century.” – Mark Corroto, All About Jazz\n“Fujii is an intuitive pianist who seems to approach improvisation with a composer’s sensitivity; she can fill audio space with cascades of sound or can allow ample breathing room with sparser, quasi-premeditated pitch collections.” – Mike Borella, Avant Music News\n“There is something beautiful going on here, very organic and rather pure at times. Most of this doesn’t really sound improvised since each section sounds like another scene from an ongoing series of stories… This disc is magical/musical improv at its best!” – Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery\n“Of all the Fujii releases so far this year in her one-per-month 60th birthday celebration, for me, Triad is the most special.” – Peter Thelen, Expose\n“Free jazz artists Satoko Fujii, Joe Fonda and Gianni Mimmo come together to create music that is inspired by the mysteries of the universe. They poke at each other playfully to spark moments of brilliance and complexity.” – Oscar Groomes, O’s Place\n“Sonic Jackson Pollocks…boldly going where no man has gone before.” – George W. Harris, Jazz Weekly\n“As a pianist, Fujii can be unto a force of nature, a torrent of swirling notes and spiky clusters. For the uninitiated she can evoke powerful key-crackers Cecil Taylor and Don Pullen; Fujii also embodies the oblique lyricism and delicate touch of Myra Melford (with whom she’s duetted) and Matthew Shipp. While no one is liable to mistake her for Errol Garner, Fujii’s output features sublimely lyrical and emotionally directly playing…heartily recommended.” – Mark Keresman, JazzEd Magazine\n“She is a genius.” – John Payne, Bluefat\n“Fujii’s talents as an improviser are on display on Triad, a without-a-net balancing act by her, bassist Joe Fonda and Italian reedplayer Gianni Mimmo…a match made in heaven…. Empathy abounds, most notably on the stunning 42-minute ‘Birthday Girl’. It evolves so naturally from one episode to another, from dashing interplay to dramatic gesture to pointillist exchange, it seems governed by its own internal logic.” – John Sharpe, New York City Jazz Record\nJoe Fonda “is a serious seeker of new musical horizons,” says the Boston Phoenix. From 1984 to 1999, he was the bassist with composer-improviser and NEA Jazz Master Anthony Braxton. Fonda also has been an integral member of several cooperative bands, including the Fonda-Stevens Group with Michael Jefry Stevens, Herb Robertson, and Harvey Sorgen; Conference Call, with Gebhard Ullmann, Stevens, and George Schuller; the Fab Trio with Barry Altschul and Billy Bang; and the Nu Band with Mark Whitecage, Roy Campbell, and Lou Grassi. He is currently a member of The 3dom Factor, Altschul’s trio with saxophonist Jon Irabagon, and guitarist Michael Musillami’s trio, among others. He has led some truly unique ensembles of his own including From the Source, which features four instrumentalists, a tap dancer, and a body healer/vocalist; and Bottoms Out, a sextet with Gerry Hemingway, Joe Daley, Michael Rabinowitz, Claire Daly, and Gebhard Ullmann. He has released twelve recordings under his own name.\nImproviser and composer Gianni Mimmo has built an international reputation for his unique treatment of musical timbre and his exploration of advanced techniques on the soprano saxophone. Based in Milan, Italy, Gianni is known for his innovative cross-disciplinary projects with poetry, photography installations, and film, as well as solo performances and international collaborations with improvisers in the US and throughout Europe. He has worked in duos with US cellist Daniel Levin, Basque guitarist Xabier Iriondo, English violinist Alison Blunt, pianist Gianni Lenoci, and fellow soprano saxophonist Harry Sjöström. He is a member of improvising ensembles the Shoreditch Trio and the Wild Chamber Trio. He performs improvised scores for film, composes graphic scores for chamber quintets ands of poetry and spoken word texts. He has operated Amirani Records since 2005.\nCritics and fans alike hail pianist and composer Satoko Fujii as one of the most original voices in jazz today. She’s “a virtuoso piano improviser, an original composer and a bandleader who gets the best collaborators to deliver,\" says John Fordham in The Guardian. In concert and on more than 80 albums as a leader or co-leader, she synthesizes jazz, contemporary classical, avant-rock, and Japanese folk music into an innovative music instantly recognizable as hers alone. Over the years, Fujii has led some of the most consistently creative ensembles in modern improvised music, including her trio with bassist Mark Dresser and drummer Jim Black, the Min-Yoh Ensemble, and an electrifying avant-rock quartet featuring drummer Tatsuya Yoshida of The Ruins.",
