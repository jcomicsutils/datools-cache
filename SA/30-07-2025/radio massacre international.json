            "about": "11th October 2022 marks the 25th anniversary of a major 1997 concert in Nijmegen. Here we are hitting the concert hall stage at Klemdag. Quite a heady experience for us. You may already know this concert from the `Bridge Too Far' release of the time....we used an ambient recording instead of this desk recording and it is now appended here as a bonus track.\nThe main feature here is a much cleaner and 100% hi-fi version, and which boasts the intro performance of `Organ Harvest' which was missing from the original published album altogether.\nThe bonus track of the original `A Bridge Too far' has been made individually downloadable for £1 to mark the anniversary.",

I enjoy sculpting larger pieces from smaller components, it allows for a variety of textures to be combined and layered to create a dense tapestry.\n`The Last Days' has an inevitable lockdown undertone to it, the long near silences are testament to those strange days where everything stopped for a while.\n`A Cosmos Of Sand' is (in name at least) a follow up to `A Galaxy Of Dust' on `The Vast Key' album. Infinity in a grain of sand. Infinite space.",

            "about": "In the early days, RMI's centre of operations was in Duncan's studio in London. Steve lived just 15 minutes down the road. This meant that at short notice an evening or weekend could be spent recording with a set up which was always ready to go. Gary would make the 500 mile round trip from Manchester when he could, but there were inevitably many more duo sessions in these early days. The recording rig back then was direct to 2-track, and mixed on the fly. Done and dusted, there and then. We used reels of 1/4\" tape at 7.5 IPS which gave 67 minutes recording time.\nAt the time we were aiming towards making CD albums, so most of the material was subsequently edited down by Steve using a mixture of methods (digital editing in its infancy, and manual tape cross-fades courtesy of facilities offered by the BBC at his day job....yes your licence fee helped pay for the post-production of this music !).\n`Abbey' was edited down to 21 minutes by the time it appeared on `lost In Space'. Here is the session reel from August 1995 in all it's uncut glory...you'll hear the odd howler...we were still taming the Maq sequencer back then...but this warts and all representation should give a good insight into the real time working methods of RMI at this time.",

            "about": "RMI have always recorded everything. It seems daft for an improvising band not to. Sometimes for one reason or another, things get forgotten about and filed away, particularly during periods of intense activity like this visit to the USA in 2010. During research for the expanded version of the 2007 session `Philadelphia Air-shot', (also just released here on Bandcamp) we checked out the 2010 session, none of which had ever been issued before. To our surprise, it turned out to be quite an enthralling and lively performance. Two hour long improvisations in the WXPN studio, again pre-recorded for the `Star's End' show due to commitments elsewhere on the night of broadcast, but done under `live' conditions nonetheless. There is some very `edge of the seat' sequencing here, and some contrasting quiet to lull the drowsy listener into a false sense of security before the sequencers come marching back. Two hours of prime `tour-ready' RMI for your enjoyment.",

            "about": "June 1979 was the month when `O' levels were completed, school was out forever, and a long summer stretched out ahead of us. We didn't look back or give a thought to those who we would probably never see again. Many of us who'd done `O' levels were on course to bag a couple of `A' levels and eventually fly off from our Teesside enclave to a university somewhere to start our own adventures in halls of residence and 'Young Ones' styled student houses across the land.\nOf far more significance to me than leaving school, the summer of 1979 also marked the beginning of a magical and fun process which continues to this day; getting together in a room and making a purposeful noise with other people.\nBack in July 1979 when Duncan and I took our seats at the History table during our prospective sixth form's `meet the students' open day, it was actually our own personal histories we were unwittingly setting in motion. One of the students who'd volunteered to tell all about `A' level History was Mark Spybey. As was `de rigeur' in those days among 16 year old boys, I had my haversack on display lovingly painted with the names of my musical heroes, and discussion soon turned away from History and to their relative merits...\"don't like them, don't like THEM, they're OK...\" Duncan piped up that he'd been messing about with audio generators and tape machines at home. \"Wow ! like Dik Mik from Hawkwind ?\" said Mark. We all agreed Hawkwind was good. Mark then uttered the immortal words which would change our lives forever: \"the college has a synthesizer you know\".\nSo somehow before we had even properly enrolled at the place, we managed to blag their most precious educational tool, the Roland SH1000, on long term loan. We could scarcely believe it as it sat in Duncan's front room making random noises at us. Spybey brought his old friend Mark Sanderson round to marvel at Duncan's tape echo skills and give us his best robot impression to test them out. We formed a band right there and then. For me it was the moment we ceased to be schoolkids and moved up into a new world. They were only a year older than us, but it felt like a lot more.\nA rehearsal was arranged for July 23rd, at Duncan 'Joe' McLeod's at 81 Hummershill Lane, Marske-by-the-Sea. If you drive past it today you'll not notice a blue `English Heritage' plaque commemorating the event. Joe was going to be the vocalist but hadn't really got a clue, hadn't written anything, and spent his time farting about, eventually rendered speechless by the racket which ensued from those gathered in his unknowing parents' house. The rest of us meant business in a 16-17 year old kind of way. On guitar was Jon Davis, who'd brought his tape machine along too, placing it right next to his amp, so all he could hear on the recording was himself. Spybey was a tidy and assured drummer, and Sandy played Bass. Spib and Sandy had worked on a collection of riffs which we used as a starting point....\nThen there was Duncan and me. Duncan had an Audio Generator and real tape echo for making swooping noises (that Ferrograph machine weighed a ton), and because I could almost pick out a tune, I got to play the synthesizer. Duncan and me had comically transported everything to Joe's house about half a mile away balanced precariously on Duncan's red Go-cart, after our primary mode of transport, made from speed-frame, had collapsed under the combined weight of the synthesizer, the aforementioned Ferrograph tape machine, and a flight case after (according to Duncan) \"about 4 foot\".\nMark Spybey had come up with a typed manifesto: \"Harmony is Harmony. Noise is Noise: This is the noise\" and a band name: AGE OF BERLIN (How thrilling to be IN A BAND, particularly one with pluralistic undertones- it would be another ten years before the wall came down) \"Space-Rock, Psychedelic Renewalism\" it continued. I'm not quite certain what the latter was exactly, but we have certainly become well acquainted with the former in the ensuing years. As we made our way precariously to that first rehearsal, we felt like we had arrived into a new world. Boy, did we have fun ! Duncan and I went through the same 18\" speaker, which didn't stop Duncan being twice as loud as anyone else, and terrorizing us with everything from echo sounders (\"Don't ! it kills yer !\" I can be heard begging for mercy on the tape) to pneumatic drills (\"Aaaaaagh ! Woooo!\") as I wazzed around on a synthesizer for the first time; literally a kid with a new toy. Before the afternoon was out that speaker would already be well on the way to premature burn out.\nIt was also the first time I'd been within touching distance of an actual drum kit, and when Spybey handed me the sticks during the lunchtime pastie break, it was the moment I'd been waiting for all my life. I already knew I was going to be a drummer, and this just confirmed it. He was also kind enough to let me have the kit on loan about a year later when he went off to college, and I taught myself to play, to the joy and delight of all at 8 Wanstead Close and surrounding properties.\nYou could therefore say that July 23rd 1979 was one of the most significant days of my life. It was the first time we heard ourselves as part of a band and at full volume, the glory of a huge vibrating racket, and I immediately knew that nothing else could compare, we had a purpose in life !\nOver that summer we spent evenings round at Spybey's in Redcar, full of exciting ideas for the band while he played us all sorts of stuff from an impressive contemporary record collection: Gang Of Four, Joy Division, The Specials' debut single Gangsters, John Cooper-Clarke, Alternative TV, `Pop Musik' by M and Tubeway Army. Things were moving fast musically in the UK, the old guard had been jettisoned (by him not us, I was still listening to Genesis) but we found common ground in the likes of Hammill, Hawkwind, Here and Now and Hillage. Before the summer was out Public Image Ltd unleashed the mighty `Metal Box' which changed things for everybody including me. Sandy actually handed over £7.49 for this artefact. He had a paid job. It was an outrageous sum for us to contemplate as penniless students, fantastic though it was.\nOne Sunday night at Spybey's, his friend Russ Walker brought Gary Houghton round to meet us. He was learning the guitar, and happened to be in the process of moving to Marske from Redcar. Jon Davis slid off the radar sometime around Zeppelin's last stand at Knebworth, and Gary became our new guitarist.\nAge Of Berlin eventually split after nearly a year's apprenticeship, during which we regularly rehearsed, never gigged, but learnt a lot in the meantime. Spybey went off to study Music Therapy, and eventually moved to Vancouver, returning back into our lives many years later with a highly impressive musical CV. Our reunion with Mark when he was a member of Michael Karoli's band in 1999 at the Can Barbican gigs was quite an occasion (\"Yes I remember playing Redcar, where is there more booze ?\" Michael Karoli)\nDuncan, Gary and me had already started recording with the synthesiser at Duncan's Studio by the end of 1979, and 40 years later here we still are as Radio Massacre International.",

            "about": "this piece first appeared in truncated form on our first self-published CD, 'burned & frozen', which was produced as an outlet for the piece we had left over from 'frozen north' when the distributor of that fine debut wouldn't let us kick off our career with an insanely long triple album. back then, private CD manufacture was a costly undertaking, but we wanted to release as much material as possible, & so for a few years we made CDr copies at great expense (blanks costing £15 each); these originals are now scarce, although professionally-made versions are still available, & you can get most of them here too.\nbut this is 'armistice' on its own, uncut and triple the length released on its 25th anniversary.\na sleeve is provided (bonus items) if you want to join the roll y'r own business & burn a CDr. it seems so easy now.",

            "about": "In 1997 Synth Music Direct supremo David Law had the bright idea of staging a concert where for a price the attendees were also given a copy of the concert highlights on CD-R shortly after the event (or at least as quickly as we could edit and duplicate it). This was well before streaming, downloads and virtual concert tickets and was quite cutting edge for the time (26 years ago). The original CD became much sought after, as there were only ever about 35 of them, and their exclusivity was preserved for many a year. Until 2007 in fact, when it was reissued in the form you see here on the early download site MusicZeit.\nThis is the whole concert from that Sunday afternoon in Bloomsbury, London, where we played a leisurely 3 sets on an early spring day. We had DJs between sets, a live lightshow and it was a wonderful social occasion in perfect surroundings. As well as the CD subscribers we had a chance to show some of our London pals what it is that we actually do, and the carpets and cushions scattered on the gallery floor added a lovely casual ambience to the whole affair.\nA day to remember.",

            "about": "Before this performance, we were relaxing in a nearby pub when we bumped into a few of our regular concert goers. They asked what we had planned for the evening's entertainment. \"Well, first we bring on the dancing girls...\" was our sardonic reply.\nExcept that it was in fact true. Dave B had asked the dance group at the High School venue if they would like to work out a routine to an RMI piece, and we chose `What's The Point Of Going To Crete?', a composition which the band could replicate on the day.\nIt was quite a novelty upon arrival that afternoon, to hear the CD of our tune blasting out in the sports hall and a rehearsal underway as we peeked through the window. The girls did us proud. You'll have to imagine them.\nAs well as the main set and encore, also included in this release are two previously unavailable contemporaneous pieces from the preparation sessions `Listening In' (Parts 1&2) which produced the `Eavesdropping' album.\nWe've included a complete downloadable version of the entire concert in performance order, as well as trimming it to fit 2 CD's.",

Available as an mp3 `virtual ticket' at the time, the set has been edited and remixed with the benefit of hindsight, and is presented here in lossless audio.\nThe second of our three visits to The Paget, this concert came at the end of a few days recording and prep, the results of which found their way on to the `Threads' and `Still' albums. It is their spirit which pervades much of the improvised set.\nSurprisingly spacious and relaxed, here is the sound of us taking our time in front of a receptive audience.",

            "about": "This 5CD collection gathers together the complete recordings from 7 quite different concerts performed by RMI between 1994-97, excerpts of which could be found on the contemporaneous compilation `Been There, Done That'. Two major concerts from within this timeline (Jodrell Bank 1996, October Gallery 1997) are issued in their entirety elsewhere, but here is the other side of the RMI concert history.\nDuncan and Steve lived a mere few miles up the road from each other in London at this time, and through connections in their working and musical environments, would sometimes get asked to perform sets for social events or share a bill with one or two of their friends bands on the thriving indie scene, and sometimes Gary could be persuaded to come down from Manchester to take part as well.\nThe October Gallery in Holborn was the venue for two fondly remembered RMI concerts in 1997 and 1998, but in fact they had made their debut there on a much less formal basis in 1994 after being invited to take part in a social gathering at the famous space. Duncan and Steve had only days earlier recorded the epic Frozen North Part IV, and took the tape for playback along with a couple of simple keyboards to make additions in live performance. After their 40 minutes was up, there was some socialising before they were asked to carry on playing more music and basically for as long as they liked. This hadn't been anticipated, and with only a keyboard each at their disposal, a fair bit of invention was required, but they soon settled into a slowly shifting soundscape which enabled the music to function as a background for what was a lively and successful party. Unheard here on the tape is Jim from Star Sounds Orchestra who jammed along on sax for much of the second set.\nThe odd one out here is the Sheffield performance, both geographically (all of the others were in London) and contextually (it was an Electronic festival with a sit down audience), but it fits with the timeline and marked a very important starting point for the band's live performing career, as well as providing a couple of lessons to take forward into future festival situations.\nCamden's Monarch pub was an indie music mainstay from the 90's onwards, and RMI opened for Adrenal and Livingstone here in March 1995 before a possibly bemused audience, a feat they would repeat a couple of times over the next year at The Garage in Highbury with the addition of Tiger (a Christmas party no less !), and the Bull and Gate in Kentish Town. It was a lively scene, people gathered in a pre-mobile phone/internet era, and socialised, with bands as a focal point. We didn't really mind that our sets being instrumental and elongated, provided a backdrop for a buzz of conversation and general racket. All of the recordings here are line mixes, so they are strangely divorced from their noisy surroundings...but somehow they have a quality about them which differs from studio recorded material...hard to define, but you can tell it's a gig.\nThe last two shows featured here originally went under the title `Never Again'. Madame Gigi's was a bar in Willesden populated by a clientele who could not have cared less about the two electronic musicians unwittingly beamed into their midst...this time it was difficult for us to even hear the music above the Friday night racket, yet the recording belies a laidback, measured and at times quite beautiful set, even if we were playing it blindfold !\nThe clincher for us was the famous Rheingold show which has gone down in band history as the moment we realised that we were never playing in such circumstances again. A truly horrible, endless night of hassles with some of the worst vibes in living memory. The music was decent enough, the mood was lightened by our chum Paul Kaye then riding high as Dennis Pennis, who always insisted on calling us MFI... but generally the audience were awful, the venue completely unsuitable and the encounter with the rozzers at three o'clock in the morning was pretty much the last straw. Never again !!\nSD 05/12/24",

            "about": "Recorded over an intensive four day period 15-18/02/08, this music represents a consciously different approach to music making for RMI. We had recently been commissioned to write a film score for Chris Zelov and the Knossus Project's `City 21' and approached all of the music over that weekend with this project in mind.\nIt is representative of somewhat of a creative arc for RMI, fresh from the release of Rain Falls In Grey, a successful November 2007 trip to the USA under our belts, with a return visit on the horizon to play NEARfest in the coming May.\nMost of the music was later cut to fit specific scenes in the film, and was represented as a single disc selection of highlights on the CD release of 2011. These four discs represent a more thorough exploration of the music made, with extended versions of certain themes as recorded at the time.\nartwork is 300dpi, & should fit a polythene slip case if you elect to roll y'r own.",

            "about": "How to encapsulate RMI's first visit to the USA?\nBack in 2002 a double CD of highlights with the title `Solid States' gave a good indication. Here in 2022 why not make available the whole lot ?\nThe trip resulted from an invitation to play the `Progwest' festival in Claremont, California, an opportunity we grabbed with both hands. We contacted our friends in Philadelphia who immediately made room in their `Gatherings' concert series schedule for a concert the following weekend.\nAdd to that a couple of radio sessions and we had a good opportunity to reach a number of people via the concert hall and the airwaves as well as spend some time seeing the sights.\nIt all began in The Claremont Inn after a long and eventful journey and eventual arrival from the UK. The piece `Ants In Me Room' was taken from the hotel room gear check and titled after Gary's unfortunate discovery of an army of marching ants for company on his headboard. `Rainy Day Rescue' came about as we felt compelled to include in the set a reference to the non-stop deluge that had greeted us since our arrival in sunny California.\nThe concert itself took place at the close of Saturday night and marked our debut on American soil, a moment beautifully conveyed by Bob Rosenthal who introduces us onstage. We took this opportunity to demonstrate the full band version of RMI, having Drums and Bass at our disposal and tailored a set we thought worthy of a Prog festival. It's here in full for the first time.\nThe next day we headed to the campus of Loyola Marymount University Los Angeles, to meet Pat Murphy host of Alien Air Music and appear on his show. This was not without problems as the studio where we needed to be was locked with no sign of the man with the key, but somehow we managed to get ourselves on air (\"A matter of professional pride\" says Duncan who'd devised a Plan B in record time). The show is presented here as broadcast including a couple of interview sections, the first with Steve, audibly giddy with the whole experience of playing in the US for the first time. Also giddy on this occasion was Gary who took it upon himself to treat the neck of his guitar as a wood planer to the contours of the studio door frame.\nAfter a day or two in the California sun, we took the short hop over to Philadelphia where we would meet our host Chuck Van Zyl for the second leg of the visit. We became well acquainted with the wonderful city of Philadelphia, and even took a day jaunt to New York before settling down to more music making, this time a concert in the surroundings of St Mary's Church on the campus in University City. It was a magical experience and this time having the whole evening to ourselves enabled us to relax and exclusively enjoy the surroundings.\nWe only had room for about a quarter of the concert on the original `Solid States' release, so presented here for the first time is the entire show. The recording is this time sourced from the pristine digital desk recording made by sound engineer Art Cohen, which for some reason wasn't available to us at the time of the original release.\nAnd as if that wasn't enough for one night, off we trooped up the stairs to the old studios of WXPN to perform a two hour- plus improvisation long into the night on Chuck's show `Stars End', taking an occasional break to open a door and stare at the Philadelphia skyline in the pouring rain while the music looped on.\nWhat an experience !\nSD 22/11/2022",

            "about": "This collection covers the immediate period of recording following DAS's debut album DAS1 (Earthdeath). Two albums we made between February 1980 and April 1981. We always thought in terms of albums with 20 minute sides even if they would never see a pressing plant. It was a way of organising the material we were recording on a regular basis (usually centred around term breaks from Sixth Form College).\nDuncan's top floor bedroom studio at 1 The Crescent, Marske (Teesside) became the hub of our activity. Tracks were expertly bounced between a UHER tape machine and a bulky vintage Ferrograph, with the results mastered to cassette or 1/4 inch depending on whatever tape stock he could beg or borrow at the time.\nGuitarist Jon Davis paid several visits to record his own very strong ideas and compositions and can be heard on much of the material recorded throughout 1980 and into 1981.He brought a series of self-written pieces to the mix which resulted in a more eclectic variety of finished tracks, establishing the idea of DAS an an umbrella for a wider range of musical exploration than the cosmic electronics of the first album. As well as the solo sketches by Duncan and Steve heard here, the DAS 1 trio with Gary Houghton also recorded several pieces, and Gary Robertson also made valuable contributions, particularly the rampant fuzz bass riff heard on `24' recorded at a sponsored all day/night concert given at the Sixth Form College we were all attending.\nWe were 16-17 years old, using very primitive equipment, but the ideas are there. Duncan as the Joe Meek of our Post Punk DIY generation did an admirable job of capturing our attempts to emulate heroes with 16 tracks at their disposal.\nThese two albums cover a year or so of recording from Feb 1980, with one notable exception, the first band rehearsal of Age Of Berlin from July 1979 (on DAS 3) with Mark Spybey on Drums, Mark Sanderson on Bass and Jon Davis on Electric Guitar. It was the first time Steve had touched a synthesizer and Duncan brought the Audio Generator based electronics set up he had been experimenting with in the loft to a band situation. This where it all started thanks to a chance meeting with Mark Spybey at a Sixth Form College open day where mutual interests were quickly established. \"The college has a Synthesizer, we can borrow it !\" were the words that changed everything.\nA new world back then, and one which we have all continued to explore in our own diverse ways ever since.",

            "about": "Here we present on the 30th anniversary of the session, an expanded version of the `Diabolica' album as originally heard as the second release in our Northern Echo CDR series.\nSo, the largest room in Duncan's HQ having become vacant due to our friend Jim Love moving on to tour the world with Tricky and settling in Australia through a bizarre set of circumstances, and where he still is 30 years on...we now had the space to record as a trio. A few sessions from October 93 onwards began the whole process of getting together and recording again as a duo, and when we hit Teesside at Xmas and sat round a pub table with Gary again, beer fuelled promises were made to get the trio of old up and working again. It's somewhat impressive in retrospect that plans made over many pints came to fruition as soon as Feb 19th 1994.\nGary travelled down from Manchester to London and we got to work recording the two hours of material you now hear in full. `Drown' is heard as a complete take for the first time. In those days we had too much of an eye on using 20 minutes of this and 25 minutes of that to try and fit CD releases, so a drastically reduced 20 minute edit ended up on our first album `Frozen North'.\nRevisiting this 30 years on, it's a delight to hear the music developing in real time on the first piece we recorded `Drown', and how Gary so easily integrates into the set up. Of course he would. We were just waiting for him to take his seat (an old stool reclaimed from the Ship Inn in Marske, our old local)\nThus RMI as we know it was born.\nWe had a cup of tea, and went for another piece. The `Diabolica' note came up in a conversation about scales between Duncan and Gary (they understand these things) it was the one note in the scale which made it the devil's music in the eyes of Christianity. \"We'll have some of that\" we thought.\nKeen listeners wondering why there is no uncut version of the piece included in this expanded reissue can be reassured that the performance was originally published in its complete form.\n`Upstairs Downstairs' was retrospectively titled as a direct reference to carrying the mellotron up and down stairs in the absence of lifts/elevators once we started gigging.\n`Blaze Dispersion' coincided with sessions Duncan and Steve were working on at the same time with Steve's old Honey Smugglers band mate and singer Chris Spence. We'd added mellotron and drums to a tune called `Flamethrower', and this was our electronic counterpart. In a parallel universe `Flamethrower was a massive hit, and this was the B-side. A 26 minute B-side. But why not. Mercury Rev were doing that shit by now. Sadly, despite a weekend's overdubbing and mixing at none other than Hans Zimmer's Lillie Yard studio in London, a major record deal could not be found, and it failed to trouble the hit parade.\n`Haze II' is a previously unreleased duo piece recorded on a Saturday night before we went out to party in Finsbury Park, and features the immense sequencing power of the Pro-One which is never to be underestimated...\nThe Uncut versions of `Drown' and `Upstairs Downstairs' are also exclusive to this set.",

(don't look for it, it's not there anymore). get stuck in.\nthere are sleeve-type things for all three discs, if you decide to burn your own CDs. the bits are there for a jewel box version of the first disc if you decide you want a replica of the original release. or just chuck the whole lot in itunes & use the generic image.",

            "about": "`Eavesdropping' was always intended to be heard in the long form that Bandcamp is able to provide. The original pieces seemed to form a whole with a continuity and consistency. At the time we toyed with the idea of putting it on a DVD for extended playing time but eventually decided against this as the medium was not as portable as we would have liked.This was of course before digital files became the norm for playback.\nHere then is the entirety of `Eavesdropping' as it was meant to be heard.\nWe've also included some `darker' remixes which were made a year or so later but not released. Eventually we used edited down versions of the original mixes of `Friday 4' (Absolutely Area 51), Saturday 5 ('The Skylab Pictures') and Sunday 10 (`This Is As Close as You Go'), just 3 out of the 8 pieces recorded, to make a single CD. We hope you like this 3 disc version.\nQuite why it has taken us so long to get around to doing it remains a mystery.",

For the uninitiated, this album was prepared ahead of Nearfest in 2008 as a kind of introduction to RMI for those who had no previous experience.\nIt consists of a bunch of five `tranches' (our favourite word at the time) made up of extracts from every one of our albums up to that point weaved together to try and achieve a coherent listening experience.\nThere is nothing unreleased on it but the stuff has never been put together this way before or since.\nLook out for volume 2 covering the 20 albums we've made since, coming soon !\nThere. Now THAT'S time wasting. (SD)",

            "about": "There comes a time in any musician's life when it's time to clear out the cupboards. Some will chose to discard anything they haven't used, some will see if there's anything there of merit, after all the only way to choose a running order for any album is to leave things out.\nThese then are some of the things which were left out, but I think they merit attention and when combined like this, provide an alternative overview.\nOf particular interest to me was the final piece `Into The Tensies' which is the earliest piece here recorded in the last minutes of 2009 and into 2010, using just the Roland SH1000 synthesiser and for many years thought to be lost. It was uncovered in 2022 after being somewhere it should not have been.\nThe first two pieces were written with Radio Massacre International in mind, and both were developed and played at several concerts and radio appearances. The 2013 Theme was renamed `The Plight Of The Bumble Bee' at one point !\nOthers are ideas which never went any further, and some are tryouts of newly acquired technology (there's a Repeater on tracks 6 & 8 for example).`Light Seagull' even represents a brief foray into working with a chord writing tool on the I-Pad, the name of which now escapes  me.In  some cases, it was only a trawl of the Korg Multitrack I use which offered up pieces I had long forgotten.\nI hope this will be an enjoyable set of snapshots from a ten year period, and for me I'm happy that the cupboards are now cleared.",

            "about": "And so we return to the start…the 40th anniversary of the original release of an album we recorded over Xmas 1979.\nOur first faltering excursion …. It all came very easily, fuelled by enthusiasm, youth and a desire to emulate those who we didn’t feel were trying quite hard enough.\nAn apprenticeship of sorts had been served in our first band Age Of Berlin, but getting the electronics away from the noise of the church hall and into the quiet of the studio was a revelation. Playing in sync with tape echo was instinctive, we’d already been programmed to think that way…men machines indeed.\nThe first side was assembled from disparate pieces into a story concept…an exciting process, (as was cutting things out of long forgotten books and getting to work with a mapping pen to fashion some kind of artwork and a story), while the second side literally catalogued the 70s turning into the 80s…\nWhat surprised us was the reaction we got…very positive from all we ventured to send it to. We had zero experience of selling or marketing at the time, and no means to fund anything as elaborate as a vinyl pressing (sorry Andy G). After several initial months of sending out hand duplicated copies ourselves, David Elliott of `Neumusik’ eventually issued it on YHR recordings cassette label with our gratitude.\nWe carried on recording DAS albums ...12 in all, and all personal landmarks in one way or another…. before eventually becoming the `grown up' version: Radio Massacre International….but this is where it all began…in the ‘70s…(just).\nSD 16/05/20",
            "credits": "released May 16, 2020\nThanks to Mark Spybey, Andy G, David Elliott, the late John Coulson (Metro Radio) and Seppo Seppinen of Espoo, Finland, who sent us our first fan letter. Of all the places in the world to play, we actually performed there in 2004.",

Mellotron, Sequencers...ah yes ! ......got to get to grips with this stuff, the potential is enormous\" says steve's diary.\nthese pieces have previously appeared in significantly edited form on the `Lost In Space' boxed set. here for the first time in 20 years are the full versions.\nthis one's on us ! raise a glass to 20 years of RMI.",

            "about": "A landmark concert for RMI, from late 2001. Some of it was on the various artists album `Hampshire Jam Preserved' released at the time, but presented here is the full set together with extended bonus material amounting to an extra 3 x 70 minute discs worth from the preparation sessions.\nThis gig, we have agreed, is definitely the one we took the most gear to ! It marks the final appearance of the Mellotron in person, a rare chance to hear the Memory Moog...Steve's sequencers are being voiced by a pair of Moog Prodigys, there's Drums for the very first time live, and Gary is debuting his brand new limited edition Rory Gallagher Stratocaster.\nThe rehearsal recordings presented many surprises and a variety of interesting performances, and the best ones of each day are presented on 3 extra discs, all of it previously unheard.\nAfter this, we scaled it all down with one eye on America, so enjoy this, RMI in peak `arms race' mode.",

            "about": "believe it or not, the artwork for the original CD release of this live set consumed more of our time & energy than any other aspect of the show or the recording. we had liked the photographs taken during our Mtv performance so much that we wanted to use all of them in the packaging, & so we sought the services of a professional who'd done the layout for CD releases where the bookletty thing unfolded into a sort of small poster. that was the idea. \"what if they want the poster & they want to keep the CD booklet in the case?\" says Gary. \"then they'll have to buy two copies!\"\nanyway. the Mtv images are all here now- these were taken by Piers Cox. do with them as you see fit, but keep it legal! the audio is a bit longer than on the original CD because CDs were smaller back in them days and we had to keep it under 63 minutes. `Skeletope' has a restored section in the middle we had originally chopped out (in what was our first ever digital crossfade longer than 0.99999 seconds, using the state of the art Sadie system trivia fans) you can still roll y'r own of this, & there is a sleeve version of the artwork to that end, as well as jewel box bits.\nthere are stories about the recce (the triplets, 'skeletope', Sir Bernard Lovell's grand piano in the planetarium), & the gig itself (Air Sculpture's mellotron dying, confirming the two-M400s-won't-both-work-in-one-room hypothesis, the realisation that we can't see or hear what we're doing by the light of the orrery & with the PA facing away from us), but it was a pretty good show nonetheless. even if the coca cola was 50p a tin.",

            "about": "Recorded Easter 1983 in Marske. The innovation this time was the use of the downstairs music room complete with two pianos. The title piece of this album uses a `ground tape' of a two piano/percussion performance by Steve and Duncan, which we initially called `Jazz In Britain'. (It was at this time that BBC radio had a weekly programme featuring all kinds of weird and wonderful sounds from the likes of Derek Bailey and Company, whose free stylings were a definite influence here).\nKeyboard overdubs were made upstairs in Duncan's studio by the trio, with the added novelty of a microphone out of the window picking up birdsong and sounds from the local school. Most of those kids will be nearing 40 by now.\nThe two longer pieces in the second half were again recorded using piano, bass guitar and Steve's newly acquired Moog Prodigy, which Duncan had already modified to make screams like a pterodactyl.\n`XB' is a tribute to the Theakstons brew of the same name, served in the pub literally out the back of Duncan's, and where we would retire for last orders. Happy days\nAdd to that a couple of solo pieces (`Angular Gyrus' is Steve's, `5' is Duncan's) and you have a snapshot of what we were up to in early 1983.",

            "about": "`Light & Dark’ is Radio Massacre International member Steve Dinsdale’s fifth solo studio album, and represents a continuation of the somewhat lighter (dare we say `commercial’?) style of his solo music. The running order and length was designed for possible vinyl release, but when this proved impractical, the concise nature of the album still suggested itself as an advantage, and although more material was available Steve was keen to maintain a collection of pieces that could comfortably be listened to in one sitting. “I like an album that can be assimilated in one go; not so long as to have forgotten what the first track sounded like by the time the last one comes along” says Steve.\nThe mood of the album is generally upbeat and positive, with bright textures and melodies suggesting a colourful and generally sunny outlook created by Steve’s use of sequencers, drums and the classic keyboard sounds (Rhodes and Mellotron in particular) with which he has become associated. The almost funky `Hit of Summer’ is perhaps the least typical excursion, yet in many ways the most appealing; “to me it sounds like the sun’s reflections dancing on the sea on a glorious day. Like all the pieces here it didn’t start out as any grand plan it just ended up that way once I started overdubbing” Steve smiles, “and the lower end of the Rhodes keyboard does a surprisingly convincing impression of a Bass Guitar”.\n`Moonweed' is of course an affectionate nod to Tim Blake, whilst `First Light' uses the authentic sound of the dawn chorus recorded in Skipton where the album was made...not just any old dawn chorus...these things are important.\nA spontaneous approach also brought out the doomy, dungeon-like textures of `Dark Chambers’, a piece which started off as a layered percussion meditation upon hearing some bad news about the possible future incarceration of an artist held in high esteem. Luckily this didn’t transpire, but the piece remains as a stark and necessary contrast to the rest of the album, and indeed as the justification for its title.\nBook-ending the collection are two pieces recorded with lifelong friend and band-mate Gary Houghton on guitar: “He didn’t know he was recording for my album when he visited, I didn't either, we were just trying out ideas. He brought the Gary Houghton effects arsenal for which he is justly famous, but rather less impressively left the power supply unit at home some fifty miles away. Instead I had to put him through my somewhat more basic effects pedal, but I like how this makes him sound less like Gary but at the same time unmistakably him”.",

            "about": "Please note: Previously released as part of the CD-R boxed set `Lost In Transit'\nRecorded on Saturday 8th May 2004 on Radio Massacre International's 2nd visit to St Mary's Church in Philadelphia.\nThe concert has a couple of distiguishing features which set it apart from other RMI performances. Gary had been out shopping in town in the afternoon and returned with a lap steel guitar, which was of course incorporated immediately into the set that night. Thanks to the extreme generosity of musical friends in the area, we also found ourselves with two Mellotrons at our disposal, not to mention an AKS synthesizer.\nNever a band to do things by halves, it was decided that the first set would be a `non sequencer' oriented improvisation. The piece in question `An Ending Is Just A Beginning' was further distinguished by the contribution of St Marys church organist Peter, who we asked to open the piece for us.\nThe rest of the concert consists of more of what may be regarded as more traditional RMI music, with the sequencers set to `stun'.\nThis was also the concert which got us signed to Cuneiform Records.",

The third of the four concerts performed by RMI at the NSC (See `People Would Really Like Space Rock', `Hog Wild' and `National Space Centre 2006').\nThere is a lot to be said in favour of a familiar environment, and being the sole performers at a concert, it makes for a much more relaxed evening in terms of set up and technical issues. Here we see RMI hit their stride with a classic space introduction full of textural variation and in sympathy with the spectacular setting of the Space Centre. The sequencers are forceful and assured, there is some crazy Moog soloing here, and the towering guitar sound of Gary Houghton is in full force.\nThis is a prime example of one of RMI's 100% improvised concerts, inspired and driven by unique surroundings. For sequencer fans this performance is highly recommended.\nWe dedicated the gig to Tommy Vance who had passed away a month or so earlier. The night itself was also the 30th anniversary of the legendary Tangerine Dream gig at the Albert Hall that TV himself had dug out of the archives back in '81 for a certain member of RMI, and without whom etc etc etc....",

He can be heard on the extended opening improvisation on Mini Moog and EMS Synthi-A.\nGary decided that Ian guesting with the band was such a momentous occasion that he would like to watch from the audience, which is why he is not heard until the set piece `The Sea' which follows.\nThe closing `New Orleans' was an early live extemporisation on what would become `Bettr'r Days' on the `Rain Falls In Grey' album released the year after this concert, complete with Drums, although the coda heard here in Leicester is an extended improvisation which belongs uniquely to the concert, bringing another epic night to a close.",

            "about": "13/02/24:\nAfter hearing the news about Damo's departure we wanted to offer this as a tribute and a celebration.\nThanks to you Damo for stopping off on your never ending tour for a couple of amazing nights with us. People all over the world will be undoubtedly be saying the same thing. To us these gigs were really special, memorable, and fun beyond description. We still enjoy listening to them. You did us proud and we all did something special and unrepeatable.\nLove, peace and fearlessness to our Metaphysical Transporter.\nThe tour will never end.\n***NO PAYMENT REQUIRED***\n(Previously released as part of the CD-R boxed set `Lost In Transit')\nOriginal Sleeve Notes:\n\"RMI had been thinking about the possibility of a concert with Damo Suzuki for some time, when the opportunity presented itself in Manchester courtesy of Jay Taylor's Night and Day Club. It was, of course, a night to remember. Damo's principle of `instant composition'/`no plan' fitted RMI's ethos well. (Don't tell anybody, but we had already pre-written Track 2 whilst imagining what we might play with Damo when the idea first came up). The rest was literally and categorically made up on the spot. Don't ask us how.\nTwo and half years later, and at the eleventh hour, the opportunity presented itself once again. This time Gary couldn't make it, Duncan had to make a dash from London to Sheffield, and we found ourselves with a new reeds maestro Martin Archer (the start of a continuing friendship), and new guitarist (Steve's brother Jonny), who makes his living as a country artiste and who was not inconsiderably horrified at the prospect of playing improvised music in front of an audience having never done so before. Of all the musicians he has played with, Damo has never forgotten Jonny, and the night he played with a country singer in his band\".",

As well as an opening suite of new compositions and improvisations, there is a complete rendition of the album, the first half taken from Orion in Baltimore with Premik Russell Tubbs and Cyndee Lee Rule, and the second half from the Y-Theatre in Leicester with Martin Archer.\nSome might say it even knocks the studio album into a cocked hat.",

One of the lesser known performances in the RMI discography it rewards a fresh listen revealing hitherto uncharted territory and a deep sense of exploration, along with a few rough edges. Unlike many of their live performances, this has not been edited, as the whole performance seemed to be crying out to be heard. Yes there is a struggle to keep things in tune at times (\"tuning a Mellotron doesn't\" R.Fripp) but this is ultimately all part of the authenticity of an RMI live performance presented here in full.",

All improvised of course.\nOutside in the wider world there is a whole airline crisis kicking off around an unusually dense and dangerous cloud of volcano ash which is threatening the safety of flights back to the UK.\nSome of us were more anxious to get home than others, but in the event, the first plane back to Manchester was the one we'd booked on before all the fuss. It didn't look like that at the time though !",

            "about": "somewhere there are some notes where the version of \"rainy day song\", here deliberately misspelled, is described as a 'stoned stitch job'...\nwhat happened was that we did two very similar sets, unusual for us, but the idea was to reduce the risk of disappointment for the folks who couldn't get to both of the two gigs, a fortnight apart. this made sense at the time...\n& so when it came time to put out the traditional document of the live sets, we were faced with choosing between two versions of each of the pieces in the set. this was fairly straightforward for the most part- various technical things &/or operational howlers made the choice for us, but the two versions of RDS were both pretty decent. while comparing them, we hit upon the idea of running them simultaneously & panning them left & right. so. that's how it ended up like it is here.\nthis set was originally available on a long gone limited edition 4xCD-R various artists set, `concerts at jodrell bank' although not with the rather splendid cover art seen here.",

            "about": "This, my first solo album, came about quite quickly once I'd stopped staring at the digital multitrack for about 3 years and actually switched the thing on and started figuring out what to do with it. I kept things simple (it's my only option) and tried to see what would happen working on my own.\nI enjoy putting albums together and spent a lot of time making sure the tracks were in a good running order. I'm also a fan of the 40 minute album and shorter pieces despite my parent band's more extensive explorations. It's an album you can get through easily, and that's important I think !\n`Wright On' was dedicated to the legendary Rick Wright who had recently passed at the time and who was a key player in the development of the space rock we all know and love.\nWDR 74 was what I imagined you might hear by accident one night in the Germany of the mid 70's, a mysterious medium wave broadcast perhaps.\n`March For Peace' will always be known by me as `March Of The Nits', as my daughter was 8 at the time and that evening going through an annoying and disgusting smelling treatment for the scourge of schools everywhere....headlice, and making a right fuss about it...I told her the music represented them crawling all over her head like an army, which pleased her no end.....but you can't call a track that can you ?\nI recorded in a tiny corner of an open plan house...I liked the distractions, and still do I suppose...there's a solo on the next album that I played as my daughter was literally tugging at my other arm.\nI had a very enjoyable time making this collection and now that the physical copies have finally run out, it's appearing here on Bandcamp as a permanent fixture.",

Only a small extract of this concert has been issued before (on `Upstairs Downstairs' back in 2000), so this is the first time it has been heard in its 100 minute entirety.\nChronologically it came shortly after the sessions for `Borrowed Atoms' and we were still in full improvising mode. It was a very hot day in the heart of London town and there was fainting in the gallery !",

            "about": "My second solo album followed quite soon after the first and was a collection consisting of four upbeat pieces and a 30 minute suite dedicated to my new love.\n`Egyptian Reggae' bore no resemblance to the Jonathan Richman tune we all know and love, `Can Do' is my Can tribute. Getting a sequencer to play the Drums seemed like an appropriate nod to Jaki Liebezeit and the keyboard tones certainly owe a lot to Irmin Schmidt. `Pandora' was inspired by something that will remain a secret. `Consequences' is a title plucked out of the air as they often are. I'm particularly proud of the keyboard run in the middle somewhere which was played as my daughter tugged on my arm to try and drag me into her world and stop playing silly keyboards !\nThe `On The Other Side' pieces are dedicated to Kathy and new love. We've been happily married for 11 years now. How quickly it goes.\nThe melting ice on my windscreen one morning seemed to form itself into a vague but recognisable approximation of a map of North America and Europe moving towards each other. She came from the USA to join me in Europe. It was one of those deeply significant moments which happen sometimes, and it still amazes me to this day.",

            "about": "Following the completion of 'Republic', RMI continued to record regularly. At this time Duncan and Steve lived less than 5 miles from each other, so sessions could be arranged at the drop of a hat. Gary regularly made the trip south to complete the trio. This collection of material covers the period leading up to the compilation and release of the third studio album 'Organ Harvest' in late 1997.\nSessions were always recorded, but not always given the scrutiny they required, or were taken over by events, superseded by more 'important' work. Also at the time of course, a 70 minute CD was still regarded as a relative extravagance, and so a band as prolific as RMI were always going to enjoy a surfeit of material.\nLooking back 25 years on and with the luxury of expanded platforms such as this, it is possible to re-investigate the early years of RMI in more detail and with it the classic studio sound from the Northern Echo in London. From 2000 a more flexible approach was needed as Steve rejoined the ranks of the Northern population and the axis shifted to Stockport and the famous Greenhouse.\nFollowing the re-introduction of the original album as released in 1997 on Disc 1, Disc 2 begins with the initial version of a piece RMI would re-visit regularly over the years. 'Organ Harvest' was initially recorded alongside 'Retina Flood' in late 1994, and left on a shelf until it was revisited in early 1997 for the concert at the October Gallery. The original near hour long piece has never seen the light of day until now.\n`Destroy Cathedral City' was, unusually, recorded away from the Northern Echo largely by Gary, with a visiting Steve making a contribution on chronic keyboard. This 4-Track demo captured the spirit better than subsequent attempts to re-record it so we chose it.\nThe 1996 Duncan and Steve duo sessions captured on Discs 3 and 4 yielded some interesting results and most of them are heard here for the first time. `Monstrous Tides' made it to the catalogue (on the `Startide' album), but this is the uncut version without the accidental interjection from Andrew Sachs. `Edison' featured on the final `Organ Harvest' in much shorter form than the 40 minutes heard here.",

            "about": "Tracks 1-3 are further duo sessions from 1996, `Bells Of Baumann' is our self-explanatory celebration upon the arrival of the actual Mellotron tape rack which belonged to Peter himself. Julian Cope had first shout on this but wasn't clued up enough to realize what he could've had.\nTracks 4-6: `Geiger' and `Titanic' were trio pieces recorded in the same evening and once again are represented in their extended forms. 'Geiger' would take on a life of its own as a live staple, but this is how it happened for the first time, out of nothing. `Titanic' is also exclusively the desk recording for the first time. We had mixed a room mic into it first time around. `Fire and the Monster' was recorded earlier the same day.\nTracks 7-12 capture RMI at the end of January 1997, this was the first trio session for a few months, in anticipation of the first October Gallery gig performed on 9th February. Six roughly 20 minute pieces, five of them previously unreleased. `Rainy Day Song' would go on to appear on the final version of `Organ Harvest' later in the year, but the pieces leading up to it had been all but forgotten.\nSome amusing/interesting titles to grapple with: `Sunny Teesside's full title was `Come To Sunny Teesside Mrs Emerson', not a reference to the keyboard giant Keith, but in fact a Brazilian footballer who had signed for Middlesbrough FC and whose wife was somewhat reluctant to leave Rio De Janiero behind for the bracing splendour of Redcar.\n`Not Even In The Room' is a literal reference to Gary's non-physical presence at the recording of this piece....having left a loop running and found something else to do, which probably involved watching the Grand Prix on TV. `Silver Machine' is obvious (although by no means a cover version), and `Searching For The Spark's significance is lost in the mists of time, other than sharing a title with a Steve Hillage classic loved by all of us.",

            "about": "Tracks 1-3 date from a Summer of 1997 trio session, only one of which has seen the light before in edited form. We'd just acquired a Notron sequencer and were putting it through its paces on Tracks 2 and 3.\nTracks 4-5 represent a major discovery in that these recordings were thought ruined by some dodgy tape stock we'd used at the time. Not so. This is an epic two hour duo workout in preparation for our second concert at Jodrell Bank.\nTrack 6 is the album we could have made from these tapes had we known, and the whole extravaganza is concluded with an unreleased 1997 studio rehearsal of Organ Harvest to bring everything full circle.",

            "about": "these pieces were the first attempts by duncan & steve to create electronic music, & were recorded during the first months of 1979, shortly before we discovered like-minds & collaborators.\nthe equipment was basic- an oscillator, a home-made mechanical sequencer & a couple of quarter-inch tape recorders.\nwe make no apology for the experimental nature of these pieces.\nthe publishing of this material now has been hastened & prompted by the untimely demise of pete shelley, founder & singer of the buzzcocks. his own musical career started in much the same way as ours- home-made electronics & a tape-recorder, & we would urge you to seek out his 1974 work \"sky yen\" on this basis.\nradio massacre international december 7th 2018",

            "about": "New Release from RMI, this time a unique session for Stars End radio on WXPN in Philadelphia in 2013. Our last recorded piece on USA soil to date, and an interesting one ! Following a triumphant concert at The Gatherings Concert Series we decamped to the WXPN studios to play live between 2-4 am, only to find out that something major had crashed when the equipment was booted up again. It meant we were faced with the prospect of a 2 hour performance with no sequencers. But of course we rolled our sleeves up and got on with it ! Here it is distilled to 70 minutes, it takes some interesting twists and turns, and out of the air some interesting evolutions occur as well as some cheeky tributes. See if you can spot them.",

            "about": "This is an expanded version of our CD-R release `Philadelphia Air-shot' (NE 020) which consisted of the second set we recorded for WXPN Philadelphia's show `Star's End' in 2007. A listener recently suggested that we revisit the first set we recorded that night too, so here it is issued for the first time. We are somewhat puzzled why it didn't come out earlier, but what a pleasant surprise.\nOn the night of broadcast, show host Chuck Van Zyl played out the second set first, and vice-versa. We've included as a bonus here for the sake of authenticity, the off-air recordings from the `Star's End' show complete with Chuck's announcements, recorded back at the hotel when we should have been sleeping.",

            "about": "sleeve-art: the image above is for itunes & the like.\nin the \"extras\" section hereabouts, you can find a version for those nice polythene sleeve things we've been using for our CD-R releases, & also an insert & tray liner set for jewel boxes. they should come out the right size... they're 300dpi if it helps.\nOne aim of our presence on Bandcamp is to present complete, unedited studio sessions which shed new light on some of our older recordings. Many pieces from the early Northern Echo era were heavily edited, (often with good reason of course), from extended improvisation and have existed in much longer form, untouched for nearly 20 years.\nWe started recording as Radio Massacre International in 1993 , so to mark our 20th anniversary, we'll be making available complete sessions for the first time. Some of these will feature familiar material in it's orginal context, others will be completely unreleased. Be assured our usual quality control standards will still apply, but if we like it, it goes out !\nRecorded 10th August 1996 at Northern Echo, this session has only ever seen the light of day via a swiftly compiled 20 minute composite edit for a long gone compilation album. What we have here are 3 extended pieces presented exactly as they were recorded on the day, totalling 2 hours of music. Most of it is unreleased, and while slightly imperfect in places, it presents an accurate picture of a typical early RMI session. Here, like several early recordings, we are a duo....although you will hear guitar throughout !\nThe original edit is included here as a bonus.",

            "about": "two more pieces recently restored, from the same sessions that produced 'republic'. indeed, 'pyramid' was originally posited as a track on that album, our second licensed release, until we realised that the resulting set would be a bit short of guitar.\nboth pieces here have been available previously, but abbreviated: 'quarry' in an edited form as part of the 'lost in space' set, & 'pyramid' similarly shortened for a short-run compilation ('is there anybody out there?') released by ashok prema a long time ago.\nthese pieces were originally recorded straight onto 1/4\" tape, & the reels lasted for around 66 minutes, so we had to keep an eye on the deck whilst playing, & be ready to \"do the ending\" as the tape ran out, good practice too, for not out-staying our welcome on stage.\nthe tape ran out before we were ready, sometimes...\nthe provided artwork (bonus items) includes two liners for sleeved CDs, if you want to burn the files to something shiny. 600dpi should do it.",

(*it was licensed to a record company over 20 years ago, I think we'll be OK. Ed.)\nwe'll make you a CD of it for a not too ridiculous sum, but we'd far rather not, as the downloads here are the same 0s & 1s as you'd get on a disc, & they don't ruin the ecosystem, which is kind of the point of the artwork of this album... that's the atmosphere being swept away into space, you see.",

            "about": "Republic was originally released as radio massacre international's second album and has proved to be a firm favourite. Then, when CDs were at their height of popularity, it seemed luxurious to have 74 minutes of playing time available on a single disc, but our recordings were still heavily edited in order to present more than a single piece on an album. Lots of 'invisible' edits to distill the essence of each piece down to twenty minutes without losing anything.\nHere, then, the uncut versions, & you can hear the tape running out at the end of the title track; back then a reel of tape lasted about 66 minutes, & we'd keep an eye on it whilst playing, much as one would draw a live piece to a close based on the restlessness of an audience, or call it quits on a painting as the last few squared centimetres of canvas gets its fourth daubing.\nSpeaking of artwork- if you want to put these pieces onto shiny discs, they'll need one each, & therefore there's a sleeve-liner to print out for each title. .\nThree pieces, recorded on three occasions back there in London in the distant summer of 1995.",

            "about": "A brand new solo album inspired by and recorded during a trip to the wonderful Hebridean island of Islay. It has been a life's ambition to return to this magical place I visited twice as a child. I was stunned over fifty years later to find that it was as unspoilt and beautiful as I remembered.\nDuring the day we explored the island in a series of beautiful adventures and in the evenings during the two week stay I recorded a series of musical sketches and spontaneous pieces using the three keyboards I had taken along with me on the trip.\nThey eventually took shape as this album, and I added finishing touches here and there in the following months until it was complete. It reminds me of a very special place in my heart and soul. Beauty on our doorstep relatively speaking, and an unspoilt paradise not too many are even aware of. I'm happy to keep it that way !\nThe music within reflects the elemental forces of nature so prevalent on an untamed landscape like this, open to the elements, and as well as the sun sea and sand, the darkness of long cold winters. But most of all, the mystery and the eternal beauty of millions of years of unchanging geographic features, the ebb and flow of the tide heard throughout the album in recordings made in these locations in between taking thousands of photographs.\nAs a friend pointed out, there is also a famous whisky from the island called `Scarabus'. This did NOT inspire the title, nor was it expressly recorded under the influence (My personal favourite is Machir Bay anyway...the distillery was literally yards from where we were staying).\nRather the inspiration came from a road sign for a random place up a single track road, which of course we had to follow. It turned out to be a farm with some very fragrant but unique looking sheep. In Norse it means `A rocky place' which perfectly sums up the spirit and appearance of the beaches around the island and its spectacular rock formations.\nI knew I had my album title !\nSD 05/12/24",

            "about": "This, the second primer for our back catalogue takes a more conventional approach than the forerunner `Fast Forward', and attempts to construct a listenable single disc compilation using stand-alone extracts from each of the albums since 2008 to present a collection that as well as serving as the perfect introduction, those with everything we've done might also enjoy listening to it too. Kind of like a `Greatest Hits' but not.\nWe've attempted to capture the essence of our output and allowed the sequencers to run for a decent length of time rather than fading them all after 5 minutes, and contrasted these sections with what we have come to call `Still' pieces (or indeed `Lethargic' explorations such as that of the `City 21' extract here).\nTaken as a whole it should not only provide an initiation into the music of radio massacre international but could also be something of a `go to' collection for those with many other artists vying for their attention.\n(Please note each track title refers to the album it can be found on).",

It was during this period the we played at Klemdag 1997, and indeed the first disc represents part of the preparation for that major concert in Nijmegen.\nIn early 1998, using `Plastered In Paris' as a starting point, RMI resolved to make the best double CD we could and play to our strengths. There is a continuity to these pieces which were all recorded in a short and intensive time frame, sometimes literally one after the other.\nThere is much here which was unreleased, and those pieces which were released are presented in unedited form for the first time.\nArtwork is at 300dpi; the sleeve versions should print out at 250mm x 125mm if you decide to roll your own & bag the discs in easily-available polythene CD sleeves. if you burn CDr of these sets, please follow the track listings on the sleeve backs for the best fit & preferred order.",

            "about": "recorded in london 19th april 2001 and manchester 20th may 2001\ndisc1 of this set, if you're rolling your own*, is the originally published album in its final form, with the guitar parts added separately in manchester, not the first time we'd worked this way, but the first time it had been planned. thus, when you hear the unedited versions of the two tracks (discs 2 & 3) without the guitar, you may sense that we were leaving room for the guitar parts that came later. that said, there's a peculiar noise, unidentified to date, on the piece that became 'planets...', which at the time we called 'the ghost of baz' because it sounded like the sort of interjection gary would've made, had he been there. there's also a noise that sounds like a digital glitch; it's not, it's the sound of a can being opened next to the mic we had open in the room.\n'friday the 13th' (disc 4) was something of a dry-run for these sessions, basically trying out the korg multitrack with the keyboards & sequencers spread out across eight tracks instead of straight to stereo. in the end it made little difference to the result, though it was good practice for a later collaboration with ian boddy.\n*if you do burn CDs, there are individual sleeve images for all four in the 'bonus items' bit.",

            "about": "Back in October 1994, RMI completed work on `The God Of Electricity' which had started life in June of that year. From early on, the idea had been to incorporate shorter musical passages to make a coherent whole.\n20 years later, we have revisited the original recordings of the component parts and looked beyond the strict limits imposed originally.The result is an expanded version of the album which, at two hours, doubles the length of the original.\nThere are slight structural changes too, the album is now book-ended with two separate takes of the guitar theme, and although no new overdubs have been added, there is evidence of material unused in the original mix, and indeed overdub material missing from what became the final mix.",

            "about": "`Maelstrom' the original album was selected from the raw material now presented here exclusively on Bandcamp in two volumes. On re-visiting the session tapes we found that we'd perhaps been unfairly harsh in pruning down the material to just one album. By presenting the material in this way, the evolution of the material can be heard as it happened in real time, as we present the uncut improvisations from which the final album was compiled.\nVolume One documents the complete sessions from July 1999, presenting 3 CD's worth of material in the order in which it was recorded. After abstract beginnings, the material slowly gains shape as sequencer patterns begin to build and take hold. It culminates in an extended hour long version of the closing section of the original album.",

            "about": "`Maelstrom' the original album was selected from the raw material now presented here exclusively on Bandcamp in two volumes. On re-visiting the session tapes we found that we'd perhaps been unfairly harsh in pruning down the material to just one album. By presenting the material in this way, the evolution of the material can be heard as it happened in real time, as we present the uncut improvisations from which the final album was compiled.\nVolume Two from the second sessions in October 1999 hits the ground running with a double length version of the section of music which opened the original album. The following two half hour plus pieces are completely unreleased until now, and the reason why remains somewhat of a mystery; they are both strong sequencer based pieces which develop and maintain interest throughout, making heavy use of the Notron sequencer alongside the familiar Doepfer. With liberal use of the Mellotron, these two pieces are both forgotten treasures from a classic RMI era.",

            "about": "Steve was asked by a radio contact of his if he would consider making a weekly feature of some concert extracts from Radio Massacre International's career. John Leith who ran the `Music Machine Scotland' station had heard RMI via Facebook and offered Steve the chance to create a series of features to follow the regular Thursday night shows on The Music Machine from one of RMI's early DJ heroes Brian Anderson, who they grew up listening to on their local station; an honour which Steve was happy to accept on behalf of the band.\nOver the 12 editions in this series, Steve has delved into the archives and recorded his reminiscences by way of introduction to each piece, to give it context and sometimes amusing insight into the circumstances of each recording. The versions presented here are especially adapted to fit a loose 25-30 minute programme format, so in some cases there are brand new edits, and even a couple of previously unreleased pieces lurking in there.\nHopefully you'll find these an entertaining set of programmes to listen to as we take a fresh look back upon the history of Radio Massacre International from a distance of in some cases 20 years or more.\nCollect the set and impress your friends !",

            "about": "In May 1996 we got our big TV `break', due to popular demand for our promo videos, which had enjoyed some rotation on MTV's more eclectic programmes. We spent a few days preparing a couple of short pieces, `Frozen North 2' became a quite rigid 10 minute arrangement. The second piece was based on `Zabriskie Point', a piece we had recorded a mere 16 years earlier. Re-titled `Ha'penny Bridge' after a long gone Saltburn landmark, in preparation for the TV show, we extrapolated upon the basic ideas and found ourselves with more than an album's worth of material. These recordings were used as the basis of the long unavailable `Zabriskie Point' album issued in 2000. Here, the full unedited takes from the sessions are released for the first time.\nAs the TV session approached, our friendly android Parsley visited the Northern Echo studio with our costumes for the big day, and to hear a preview of the pieces he would be moving to. Tracks 5 & 6 are what we performed for him.\nOn the day itself in the TV studio, we were limited to a couple of short takes each, enough to find 20 minutes of suitable music for the session. The takes are heard here in their entirety for the first time, along with a couple of choice snippets of behind the scenes dialogue.\nTo complete this set, a recently unearthed piece of archive from 1980, and the original recording sessions for `Zabriskie Point', including the pre-overdubbed version of the piece, which was originally conceived as a 3-part composition, although in reality, part one took so long that we never got around to the rest !\nWe were callow youths of 17 when we recorded the original, and if you'd told us then that we would be on European Television performing the piece by the time we were 33...well, we might have believed you.\n(This release is equivalent to a 3CD set, and full artwork is provided for each disc in both jewel case and wallet formats).",

            "about": "The music here was recorded as the NASA space shuttle Columbia made its initial journey between April 12-14th 1981, it was our tribute to it, and was initially called `Ra-Ra Shuttle!' by way of encouragement. Joining Duncan and Steve in the studio is Jon Davis on Guitar, Mark Spybey contributes vocals and Jan Mitchell tootles away on Recorder.\nThose were the days when instant communication was a thing of the future, so it's quite likely that some of these guests turned up unannounced to find themselves involved in the recording.\nMost of the material was recorded on the first day, and on the second day Duncan and Steve made overdubs on the final piece `Columbia'.\nThe instrumentation is unique for a DAS album, featuring Copicat echo on the very rudimentary borrowed drum kit and on the guitar (you can hear the bump of the tape loop if you listen carefully), and Duncan's custom `one repeat' long delay system, both of which help give the recording a unique atmosphere. All important also is the Roland SH1000, once again borrowed from the Sixth Form College and dragged home with great difficulty....it weighed a ton....",

            "about": "`Threads' and `Still' formed a trilogy of releases alongside `Eavesdropping', all released in 2013 ahead of our last trip to the USA. The two are inextricably linked and emerged from the same productive sessions in 2012.\nThe original plan was to make one of the albums more upbeat than the other but the lines got blurred as they often do. Texturally there are some new developments across these six discs, the use of the EMS synthesizer and some Moog sequencing, alongside the newly acquired Roland V-Drums and the mighty Fender Rhodes which continued to hold its own before being put out to pasture (well, taken to Steve's place at any rate).\nThere are vastly expanded versions of the pieces on the issued albums, and in the case of discs 3 and 6 there are continuous takes which contain elements from both albums.\nWe hope this set helps make sense of it all and how the pieces were originally created, and that you enjoy the greatly expanded (and in some cases unique) pieces on offer.",

            "about": "In 2019 after somewhat of a hiatus for the band while various practicalities were sorted out, we finally reconvened thanks to the overwhelming generosity of our friends Wayne and Karen Stephens who invited us to use a room in their home in Castleton North Yorkshire, not too far from where we'd all grown up.\nTS11 is the postcode for Teesside.\nDisc One here consists of music recorded in February 2019 over the course of about a week, while Disc 2 was recorded in October that year in preparation for an Awakenings concert, and is a single performance recorded `as live' before hitting the road to Rugeley.",

            "about": "Following the intense activity (a track per day) of the DAS album ‘X’ (there was even a session on the final Saturday morning of our Easter break, when we thought the album was already finished), ‘XI’ follows on from where ‘X’ left off; ‘Macbeth’/‘Merlin's Funeral’ is a cauldron of sound inspired by the three witches & the Third Ear Band, & was recorded during the same sessions, using the same instruments as ‘X’. (Moogs Prodigy & Rogue, Pro-1 & Casiotone 202)\nOver the course of the rest of 1984 we recorded sporadically, probably too busy socialising & drinking XB at the Middle House. ‘Grass’ was recorded downstairs in the music rooms, where Duncan’s mother taught piano, & where we could put two pianos & various percussion instruments through their paces a little. The opening & closing pieces ‘A long way to go’ & ’T.E.’ were recorded with live radio signals as part of the mix, to create a one-off sonic picture.\nFor some of these pieces, only the Moog Prodigy was available, & we were back to doing sequencing by hand. The Pro-1 & Casio heard on ‘X’ had been borrowed from James Barclay, who had since disappeared somewhere else into the depths of Sheffield Poly along with his gear. But Duncan had also acquired a decent bass at last, a smaller Casio (which was immediately subjected to some circuit-bending), & the Moog Rogue from the ‘X’ sessions had made a permanent return. These latter keyboards worked together to produce the filtered arpeggios of ‘Apostrophe’ & 'Better Things', while the bass & the Casio also feature on ‘Adjective’.",
