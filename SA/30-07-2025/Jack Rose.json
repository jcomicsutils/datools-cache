            "about": "John Coltrane died at age 40, and in retrospect it seems as if the intensity of activity in his last years, the sheer torrent of notes, was an attempt at purging the music from his soul before it was too late. The guitarist Jack Rose died at 38, in 2009, and listening back to his catalog one has a similar notion. Like Coltrane, Jack Rose’s last years were marked by a shimmering intensity, an outpouring of his spirit, onto audiences and records.\nI believe Jack Rose felt the duty of preservation but was by no means bound by it. With his virtuoso fingerstyle technique and restless guitar explorations--modal epics, bottleneck laments, uptempo rags--it’s easy to hear a connection to tradition and at the same time a pulsing modernism: “Ancient to the Future” in the words of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Ultimately, it’s no use attempting to explain the unexplainable (natural disasters, God, art, death). As the air gets heavy before a thunderstorm, Jack Rose’s vivid guitar picking awakes in us a peculiar awareness, something ancient and American. Jack Rose’s work exists along the established continuum of American vernacular music: gospel, early jazz, folk, country blues and up through the post-1960s “American primitive” family tree from John Fahey and Robbie Basho and outward to other idiosyncratic American musicians like Albert Ayler, the No-Neck Blues Band, Captain Beefheart and Cecil Taylor. His process can best be heard as an evolution; renditions of songs would transform over time, worked out live, with changes in duration, tempo or attack, in the search for a song’s essence.\n“Dr. Ragtime and His Pals” marks Rose’s step into the world of group interplay with versions of his standard repertoire arranged for a band. In its finished form, it exists as a sort of “party record” within his discography. Highlights are raucous and many, including “Linden Avenue Stomp,” “Knoxville Blues,” the spiritual “Blessed be the Name of the Lord” and Sam McGee’s “Buckdancer’s Choice.” In assembling this album, Jack chose musicians with distinctive personalities and their own personal connections to old-time music; people he could learn from. His “Pals” rotated often and in this case include the banjo player Mike Gangloff (Jack’s old accomplice in Pelt as well as the Black Twig Pickers), Micah Blue Smaldone on guitar, Glenn Jones on guitar, Nathan Bowles (Black Twig Pickers) on washboard, and Philadelphia legend Harmonica Dan (“Knoxville Blues”). The result is a late night back porch jam session, fueled by whisky, friendship, and a shared love of the old weird American music found on forgotten 78s.\nJack Rose was a larger than life man with a hearty spirit--a no-bullshit gentleman--and his death continues to reverberate among the community of musicians and music people he called friends. This spirit, as evidenced within his recorded output, has proven to be indomitable and continually vital.\n-Scott McDowell, May 2016-",

            "about": "8.7 \"Best New Reissue\" on Pitchfork. \"...the quintessential Rose album: gorgeous, inspired, and deeply confrontational.\"\n--\nJohn Coltrane died at age 40, and in retrospect it seems as if the intensity of activity in his last years, the sheer torrent of notes, was an attempt at purging the music from his soul before it was too late. The guitarist Jack Rose died at 38, in 2009, and listening back to his catalog one has a similar notion.

His process can best be heard as an evolution; renditions of songs would transform over time, worked out live, with changes in duration, tempo or attack, in the search for a song’s essence.\n“I Do Play Rock and Roll,” the title a mystifying nod to Mississippi Fred McDowell’s electric period, finds Jack Rose in extended drone mode, coaxing open-tuned raga meditations from his 12-string guitar. “Calais to Dover” first appeared on Rose’s classic “Kensington Blues” in a somewhat truncated form. The version heard here is more expansive and open-hearted, a waxing-and-waning piece of introspection. “Cathedral et Chartres” shares the same quiet romanticism, with rotating patterns and the chime of open strings, “Sundogs,” the sidelong drone abstraction that occupies Side B, stands alone among Jack’s solo work. A long-form live rendition of a track that appeared on the genre-defining triple album compilation “By The Fruits You Shall Know The Roots,” it is perhaps most evocative of Pelt, Jack’s previous band, a minor-key free drone, with only miniscule dynamic shifts and the occasional recognizable string accent. It is territory Rose seldom traveled but completely and fully invigorating.\nJack Rose was a larger than life man with a hearty spirit--a no-bullshit gentleman--and his death continues to reverberate among the community of musicians and music people he called friends. This spirit, as evidenced within his recorded output, has proven to be indomitable and continually vital.\n-Scott McDowell, May 2016-",

            "about": "8.3 Best New Reissue on Pitchfork. \" 'Spirits in the House' is a composition that displays Rose’s obsessive tendencies; it is his single most gorgeous recording...\"\n--\nJohn Coltrane died at age 40, and in retrospect it seems as if the intensity of activity in his last years, the sheer torrent of notes, was an attempt at purging the music from his soul before it was too late. The guitarist Jack Rose died at 38, in 2009, and listening back to his catalog one has a similar notion. Like Coltrane, Jack Rose’s last years were marked by a shimmering intensity, an outpouring of his spirit, onto audiences and records.\nI believe Jack Rose felt the duty of preservation but was by no means bound by it. With his virtuoso fingerstyle technique and restless guitar explorations--modal epics, bottleneck laments, uptempo rags--it’s easy to hear a connection to tradition and at the same time a pulsing modernism: “Ancient to the Future” in the words of Chicago’s Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians. Ultimately, it’s no use attempting to explain the unexplainable (natural disasters, God, art, death). As the air gets heavy before a thunderstorm, Jack Rose’s vivid guitar picking awakes in us a peculiar awareness, something ancient and American. Jack Rose’s work exists along the established continuum of American vernacular music: gospel, early jazz, folk, country blues and up through the post-1960s “American primitive” family tree from John Fahey and Robbie Basho and outward to other idiosyncratic American musicians like Albert Ayler, the No-Neck Blues Band, Captain Beefheart and Cecil Taylor. His process can best be heard as an evolution; renditions of songs would transform over time, worked out live, with changes in duration, tempo or attack, in the search for a song’s essence.\nThe album known as “Self-Titled” was originally released in 2006 on the arCHIVE label, and later reissued as a CD two-fer with “Dr. Ragtime and His Pals.” It contains a combination of studio and live recordings. “Self-Titled” is marked by a sense of forward momentum, the result of several years of constant playing, with fresh versions of a number of previously attempted songs. Blind Willie Johnson’s spiritual “Dark was the Night, Cold was the Ground” is manipulated into a wailing slide-guitar lament. “Levee” pops like a warning. “St. Louis Blues” (in this and its several other incarnations across his entire catalog) is a good example of Jack’s innate sense of swing, a crucial characteristic of his playing perhaps lost on some of his fingerpicking followers. The centerpiece of the album, however, is the nearly sidelong “Spirits in the House,” which begins with tentative weeping glissandos, and slowly reveals itself as a stately fingerpicked blues meditation.\nJack Rose was a larger than life man with a hearty spirit--a no-bullshit gentleman--and his death continues to reverberate among the community of musicians and music people he called friends. This spirit, as evidenced within his recorded output, has proven to be indomitable and continually vital.\n-Scott McDowell, May 2016-",

            "about": "Raw and rocking collaboration between Jack Rose and the Black Twigs with some of the most swinging, hard-hitting string music waxed in many a decade. Rose's solo playing has always had a tough edge, with his prodigious technique often employed in the service of dropping right-hand bombs - his use of a thumbpick originates from his years of duets with Twig Mike Gangloff, struggling to make his guitar heard over Gangloff's crashing banjo. The front line of Rose and Gangloff's strings are joined by Isak Howell's no-nonsense guitar and harmonica and Nate Bowles' variety of expert percussion. The four players lock together with a sure-footedness honed by frequent touring and a singularity of intent to rock. Gangloff takes the vocals, howling out standards like \"Little Sadie\" firmly in the old-time tradition - without reserve. A few of the tracks here are updates of Rose & family classics, with the group turning the stately \"Kensington Blues\" upbeat and issuing an assured take on \"Bright Sunny South,\" first recorded by Pelt (w/Rose and Gangloff) back in 2001 on their gonzo classic double \"Ayahuasca.\"",

            "about": "Fourth full-length from Jack, an inspired mix of styles and sounds that brings his in-person mastery down to LP/CD scale. Kensington Blues is Jack's most diverse outing by far, with straight ragtime, heavy 12-string, and that sweet sweet Weissenborn lap guitar all checking in. Honed during endless touring in 2004, the repertoire here is delivered with maximum authority in a series of first-take performances recorded in early 2005. \"Cathedral et Chartres\" and \"Calais to Dover\" are dense, brooding 12 string numbers, recalling the key tracks on 2004's Raag Manifestos CD. \"Calais\" features a sequence of right hand picking furious enough to evoke a dream state ala Charlemagne Palestine's \"Stumming Music.\" \"Rappahanock River Rag\" and \"Flirtin' With the Undertaker\" are pure syncopated ragtime, while \"Kensington Blues\" offers an almost regal take on the intersection of Anglo and American trad. The epic \"Now That I'm A Man Full Grown\" was the signature piece of many of 2004's live shows, a display of mind-boggling slide invention that straddles the line of east and west ala \"Yaman Blues\" from the Opium Musick LP. In something of a surprise inclusion, Jack's take on Fahey's \"Sunflower River Blues\" (long a staple of Pelt and J.R. gigs but never included on a record) is subtle and expressive, with a wonderful rise and fall that perfectly accentuates Fahey's beautiful melody.",

            "about": "Recorded and originally released in 2003, Opium Musick is an eclectic collection with pieces for 12 string (the percussive and dark \"Black Pearls”), 6 string, and lap guitar. The lovely raga-ish \"Yaman Blues\" features Mike Gangloff (Pelt, Black Twig Pickers) on tanpura, and echoes the extended modal work on the contemporaneous Pelt Pearls from the River CD. The near-ragtime of \"Linden Ave Stomp\" features Glenn Jones on his vintage Gibson in a jumping duet with Jack’s lap steel. “Linden Ave” charted a path that Jack would determinedly pursue – short ragtime and old-time influenced pieces (originals and classics), with all phrasing worked out to a perfectionist standard. The lovely “Mountaintop Lamento” was memorably used in Catherine Pancake’s film about coal mining in Appalachia, Black Diamonds: Mountaintop Removal and the Fight for Coalfield Justice.\n“In the year and half between \"Red Horse, White Mule\" and \"Opium Musick\" Mr. Rose spent the majority of his time honing his Ragtime and Jass skills. He met Dr. Chattanooga Red soon after recording his 1st lp and he revealed the secrets of Ragtime and Jass to Jack in ancient ceremony. Red came down with the jake in Philadelphia and died shortly after their tour. On his deathbed he told Jack not to let the ragtime die and to bring it into the 21st century. And now we have \"Opium Musick\" as a result of Jack's studies and travels, a lovely tribute to Jack's beloved teacher.”\nJoe R. Sack, Blues Scholar, on Opium Musick",

            "about": "Originally compiled from a variety of sources as a limited edition CD to sell on tour in 2004 (released by VHF, later released on vinyl by Eclipse), Raag Manifestos presents much of Jack’s rawest and most experimental music, cutting across various acoustic styles, but with a much more jagged and aggressive attack than later music. “Black Pearls from the River” and “Hart Crane’s Old Boyfriends” are dense, serious assaults on the 12 string, with the intensity of the latter enhanced by Ian Nagoski’s roaring electronic backdrop. With subtle tabla accompaniment by Eric Carbonara, “Crossing The Great Waters” is another epic modal journey in the style of Pelt’s “Road To Catawba” and Jack’s own “Red Horse.” The traditional “Blessed Be the Name of the Lord” finishes off the LP on a calming note.",

Strictly a solo affair, Red Horse balances the epic side long raga of “Red Horse” against a second side of shorter pieces, including the ragged slide style of “The Colonel’s Blues.” Jack’s technique doesn’t have the refinement that it would quickly find, but the compositions and performances hit thread the needed between the new and the classic with a rough hewn charm.\n“Rose's personalized and disparate criteria awaken feelings of both rapture and tragedy on the scale of that which must have been felt by the newly-wed anthropologist who drove Kiowa Indian guests out of his Oklahoma residence with Victrola discs of Amelita Galli-Curci in order to go to bed with his bride or the child who, on hearing Bugs Bunny sing Queen Liluokalani's dirge \"Aloha Oe,\" quarantined himself in the clothes hamper until such time that the United States withdraws from Hawai'i.”\nKisan Nagai, Blues Scholar, on Red Horse, White Mule",

            "about": "Let's get the dirty work over with first - The Black Dirt Sessions is, all hyperbole aside, Jack Rose's most complete and telling work to date. Those who have been following this Philadelphia wanderer's development and growth as a solo artist (both live and on record) know that such a statement is strong praise, as Rose's catalog is certainly not devoid of unqualified classics.\nThe album takes its title from the studio where it was recorded – Jason Meagher's Black Dirt Studios located in Westtown, New York. Old friends Rose and Meagher developed a good working relationship and full understanding of each other's work habits and styles over the course of a spring 2008 joint tour between Rose and one of Meagher's bands, D. Charles Speer & the Helix. Rose, that eternal road warrior, booked some time at Black Dirt between tours in August, September and October of 2008 to lay down some new and fully realized material. this album is the complete result of those sessions.\nRose's prior albums have tended to both pick and remain true to a musical theme. The Black Dirt Sessions excels by displaying fully honed examples of all of Rose's various styles and themes – traditional, raga and ragtime. Central to the album's spirit is the absolutely epic \"Cross the North Fork.\" This thirteen minute revisiting of a track first laid down on the great Kensington Blues is a winding, thoroughly engrossing journey. This new version is the product of Rose's perfectionist streak which constantly pushes him to re-explore and re-visit his prior works. As presented on the Black Dirt Sessions, the \"new\" track is full of rich nuances from Rose's years of additional scrutiny of the original composition. much like Rose himself, \"Cross the North Fork\" is certainly comfortable in its skin and helps make it a welcome neighbor to the album's other splendid joys ranging from the jaunty and infectious \"Fishtown Flower\" (featuring a guest appearance from D. Charles Speer & the Helix's Hans Chew on ragtime piano) to the pensive and appropriate melancholy punch of \"Box of Pine.\"",
