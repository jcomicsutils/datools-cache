            "about": "Basic Bitches = Wolves in Sheepskin + The Beatloads\nRecorded on two separate days in 2016, the combination of these two bands resulted in some incredibly intense and dynamic music. The earth quaked. There was shouting. Tears of joy and frustration were shed. It was a calamity. It was some of the greatest times of our lives.",
