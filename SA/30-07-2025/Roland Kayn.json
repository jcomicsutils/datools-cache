Across its two-hour duration, 'A Pan-Air Music' locates the ethereal space between drone and rythmic antiphony, and charts a gripping journey through it.",

            "about": "Abstracta’s two parts represent two highly distinct collections of sound material. The first is centred upon a series of clinking, metallic reverberations, occasionally interspersed with Kayn’s signature tonal bursts, and effected by spring-like treatments. While the opening part's tentative, exploratory feel has the focus and restraint of a free improvisation, the second finds us in very different territory. Rotating assemblies of jump-cut timbres vie with digital intrusions against a sustained backdrop of rich, expansive, near-choral tones. The stasis is gradually undermined by further tape play and occasionally interrogated by variations on the material of part one – now examined under a dramatically different lens.",

The reverberating landscapes we glimpse throughout the piece, however, ultimately clarify our distance from this vocabulary, and the cumulative acquisition of noise-laden textures may point to a closer parallel in the most sonically fixated work of the early industrial movement.",

At the same time, it implies that the results of such a process will reveal the essential. In these refined materials we find a new and prominent role in Kayn's sound world for speech and human communication. But buried in the residual hiss and detritus of telephonic technology through which these ancient voices converse (and, of course, the Institute of Sonology’s studios resembled a kind of telephone exchange for the sonic aesthete), a pulsing electronic heart still beats, albeit at densely alternating frequencies and amplitudes.",

A weighty orchestral presence can be sensed at intervals throughout, wavering in pitch at times as if to remind us, even amid sounds of this gravity, of the plastic nature of recording itself.",

            "about": "Kayn’s fascination with surfing the radio waves is far from unique among 20th century musicians, but rarely do the ebb and flow of modulated/demodulated drift fit so beautifully into a composer’s modus operandi. ‘Athary NLX’ finds him spellbound by several distinct plundered excerpts; do these betray an interest and enthusiasm for contemporary sounds, or simply for the process of remixing which emerged while he was operating at a remove from the musical cultures that spawned it? Can tapping these frequencies today serve to rewrite that history?",

An unusually impish perversity may be at work here in the beginning, but as rich, reverberant, drawn-out, gong-like tones begin to fill the spectral space, the listener realises that they’re adrift once more in the wide, unknown expanse of a boundless imagination.",

            "about": "Like some frenetic piece of avant-garde cinema recast purely as sound, ‘Audiogenic Events’ (2004) makes its form from discrete excerpts of diverse electronic textures and shapes. Whirling the listener through a jump-cut fantasia of everything from organ and choral allusions to bubbling synthetic polyphony and violent electrical jerks and spasms, the effect both unsettles and draws one more deeply into an anti-logic all its own. No sooner than the listener locates themselves in one spatial environment, ruled by its own forms and timbres, they are spliced into the next, operating on an entirely new set of criteria. At times the piece sees Kayn unloosing some of his most vivid and unique material – tantalising glimpses of new musical worlds wholly unvisited but for these fleeting moments.",

Built seemingly of the sounds of transmitted data – the analog refuse of the computer modem – the piece recycles, magnifies, and interrogates our collective urge for individual expression. As the distorted segments ebb in and out of audibility, cycles of suspense gradually define themselves. In the waves of our collective subconscious, no resolution is heard.",

            "about": "Metaphors on the galactic level and beyond tend to suit Kayn’s music well. His intuitive manoeuvres between the micro and macro perspectives on sound make tantalisingly fitting analogies to everything from the births and deaths of astral bodies to the expansion and contraction of universes. With ‘Constellations’, he makes the connection explicit, as we hear the chain of events linking the composer’s private cosmos to the titanic gestures taking shape from a touch as subtle as the magician’s sleight of hand.",

            "about": "Space in music can be conceptualised in various ways, from the importance of “the unplayed notes” affirmed by the most zen-minded improvisers, to the imitation or appropriation of physical space and its acoustic qualities. Kayn’s music seems to address the notion in its many facets at various moments – at times a musical lull is preparatory to a change in acoustic setting; at others it may simply confront us with a loaded pause, cannily placed for dramatic or emotive effect.\nIt should be noted that we are only able to enjoy the luxurious representation, in works like ‘Contra-Compositie’, of Kayn’s masterful command of the frequency spectrum and the stereo field thanks to Jim O’Rourke’s sensitive and thorough restoration of the composers’ home recordings. This piece – spare, unhurried, yet uncompromising in its demands of the attentive listener – is perhaps among those to benefit most from this painstaking process.",

            "about": "The cybernetic vision was never a modest one, its principles, commonly established for closed, self-sufficient systems, were often just as firmly intended for application on an expansive, even planetary scale. Perhaps this is why Kayn’s cybernetic creations take on a scale undreamed of except perhaps on the most grandiose 19th-century orchestral scale.\nThe difference here, of course, is that we have stepped outside of the metaphorical. No combination of strings, brass and percussion is required to suggest the volcanic collision of continental land masses – gargantuan slabs of noise bring it life before our very ears instead. 'Cyber Panoramical Music’ is surely one of the peaks of Kayn’s musical achievements – a cybernetic world view artistically realised.",

            "about": "Kayn's deep engagement with the field of cybernetics was perhaps the single most important differentiator in his compositional career, providing a clear conceptual break with the explorations of electronic sound taking place contemporaneously in Germany, France, and isolated pockets of activity elsewhere.\nHis understanding of the plurality of causal and semantic relationships within the sound itself is markedly clear in the two Cybernet pieces of 2003, where he pays explicit homage to that strain of 20th century thinking defined by Norbert Wiener as “the study of control and communication in the animal and the machine.” Once again the listener (or perhaps more appropriately, user) is situated in a unique sonic terrain, where the narrative is intuitively grasped, yet the events and their placement bear no traces of prior definition.",

            "about": "From 'Contra-Compositie' (a composition of contrasts?) Kayn's oeuvre directs us to the current work, 'De-Compositie', its title suggesting an unravelling or unspooling: a disentanglement. Further evidence of the process of recall, reexamination and recontextualisation the composer applied to his sonic material.\nFor which other creators in any medium was such a process so richly productive? Wherever was an untempered, inward-looking resolve so fruitful and diverse in its results? The kaleidoscopic deconstruction we witness here is yet another high point in the mostly unheard expanses of Kayn's later work. With its release, another creative seam is exposed for exploration. From decomposition, fertile growth can once again take place.",

            "about": "Demodulation: the extraction of information from a carrier waveform. Here, as ever in Kayn’s late works, the past is decoded: his own. Trawling the tape archives of his years in the studio, in ‘Demodulations’ Kayn brings yet another way of addressing these extracted, convolved fragments to the fore. The listener is once again reminded that recollections are living entities, never to be set in stone.",

As an echo from the past, to celebrate all she meant to him and all she did for him, we release 'Dino Concerto'* on her birthday, November 13.\n*Dino refers to the name Rolandino, given to him by his fellow composers during his working life in Rome.",

            "about": "‘Electronic Stabile’ is highly representative of Kayn’s approach to electronic composition at his home studio in the mid 2000s. Through manipulation of existing source material and the media upon which it is captured and played back, the listener is led through a wasteland of human voices, industrial sound, sustained shortwave radio noise, and modulated oscillator pitches, each imbued with the reverberation of distinctly varied physical spaces. Thus, landscapes intertwine and the work transcends mere collage. Kayn offers the listener a journey establishing new connections between transfigured materials. Meaning, intention, and origin are repeatedly interrogated along the way.",

            "about": "‘Extensity’ follows the epic ‘Sound-Hydra’ in Kayn's catalogue, and continues that piece's re-exploration of the composer’s bountiful experiments at the Institute of Sonology in the 1970s and early 1980s. While the scale and source material are reminiscent of the notorious extended works of that period such as ’Infra’ and ‘Tektra’, looking back on his sound palette from the vantage point of 2001 evidently found Kayn keen to emphasise contrast over stasis. Amid the signature breathtaking sweeps and near-perpetual pitch shifts, we hear jump cuts, drop outs, and abrupt dynamic shifts settle into new, compelling features of the landscape.",

Outbursts of drumming and strange Star Trek choirs keep the curiosity level high as Kayn's electroacoustic sorcery shuttles us back once more into our own cryptic inadequacy.\"\n-Massimo Ricci, Paris Transatlantic, 2005.",

Expertly hewn, and ultimately laid bare for the sheer wonder of it.",

It can be seen as a model example of the electronic works he was compiling at his home studio in the mid 2000s, opening with stretches of creeping pastoral analogue beauty, before a series of cavernous reverb-laden textural episodes unfold. Finally, some form of equilibrium appears to be found as the near-percussive elements reverse and transform themselves.",

            "about": "‘La Ranar’ finds us in some hinterland between the celestial and the industrial; grandeur and detritus. Is there even a distinction to be made between the two? Aren’t stars also born of the waste matter of the universe? Here Kayn plunders his own archive yet again to discover an infinity in the still-twitching relics of discovery itself.",

            "about": "The master tape of Roland Kayn's final composition was still present in the machine when he passed away on January 5th, 2011. 'Matego', the last piece in a 60-year puzzle, is a tense structure of modulated crystalline bursts. Far from conclusive in tone, it suggests that Kayn could well have continued fruitfully on his path of exploration and discovery for decades longer.\nTo mark the 10th anniversary of Kayn's passing, and to celebrate the enthusiastic response to the new availability of his work, we are proud to offer this music as a free download, with the option of a donation to the Lydia and Roland Kayn Archive.",

            "about": "Can electroacoustic music – born of the glitch, the treatment, and the edit – be beautiful? The sheer beauty of the sounds employed in Kayn’s music is too little remarked upon, their luxuriant, occasionally repeated deployment perhaps hinting at how the composer himself might answer that question.\nNo other body of work continually returns us to the tipping point between futurism and mysterious quasi-nostalgia – disorientation and inexplicable familiarity. The effect is fascinating, and Mutenaces embodies it bountifully.\nNo sooner than the listener begins to wonder at how a sound could be conceived, but it begins to move. We realise once again that we are not standing entranced before a static image, but an assemblage of pieces in continual motion. An alien architecture unfolding.",

            "about": "“Repetition is a form of change.” quoth the oblique strategy. But then where do we locate stasis? With Oktrol, a sub-rosa enquiry into the nature of the plateau, Kayn finds one answer. Turning his material in the light, filtering, reversing and exposing it again and again, he reaches a range of new possibilities. From the oceanic to the stratosphere, similitude is revealed to be both illusory and quietly all-encompassing.",

            "about": "Otron, as a title, has the typical Kaynian classical and scientific redolences, yet refers to no specific mythical protagonist or experimental technique. The English surname “Orton\" descends from the old English for “shore settlement”. Is Kayn claiming new territory here? Striking land? The more dramatically inclined will almost certainly prick up their ears here.\nIn the 1980s, photographer Michael Orton would blend two distinct images of the same scene to reveal otherwise impossible details simultaneously. Perhaps this Orton effect proves a better key to Kayn’s piece, as focal point pursues focal point over the work’s duration, the horizon continually shifting. Another potential entrance to the composer's chamber of diffuse secrets.",

            "about": "Did procedures reliant on probabilistic calculations play a role in Kayn’s later work? The title ‘Random Distributions’ may suggest as much, but the listener shouldn’t forget the role of intuition in this work. (The composer spent key formative years in an improvising ensemble, after all.) The reference is perhaps a more allusive one, pointing to the ever-increasing common ground between mathematics and nature, where discovery and creative self-discovery intertwine.",

            "about": "‘Rathan’ as a piece lives very much in the springs of Kayn’s reverberation units and in the electron fog of multiple generations of tape edits. Counterintuitively, somehow the resultant musical haze brings about a sharpening of the listener’s senses – as sound is disembodied from source, the brain resists, struggling to bridge the gap and identify the unidentifiable. We ultimately perceive only the winding, slowing and recoiling of acoustic phenomena, as if hearing some Proustian resequencing and reexamination of a life witnessed by the ears alone.",

Opening with the taut crystalline shards of sound so often deployed in his later work, ‘Reflets’ later finds resolution in a kind of electronically induced orchestral tremolo, before a coda almost choral in its synthetic timbre finishes this chapter conclusively.",

He had never before written a requiem, and elected to make Lumumba his subject.\n'Requiem pour Patrice Lumumba' was previously released on the ‘Multiplex Sound-Art’ CD in 2004 (Reiger-records-reeks, KY-CD 004-1/2). The recording has now been remastered and rereleased upon the occasion of Bandcamp’s Juneteenth stand for racial justice and equality.",

            "about": "‘Residual Sounds’ suggests the remainder, the cast-offs – the unusable scraps. But as orchestral tones slither into audibility, we think more of the dream life here: the residue of the psyche.\nInstrumental timbres shift into reverberation-laden voices, uttering unintelligible messages. The sound, for its muddle of meaning, is clear, spacious. A classic Kayn manoeuvre: in the rejected clusters of material, his most lush, melodic material emerges from the fog.\nResidue is no disparagement here. In the churns of the sonic drift, these residual whispers constitute yet another hitherto-unglimpsed musical constellation.",

            "about": "‘Reversioni Comprimati’ could be subtitled ‘Anatomy of a Tape Recorder’, defined as it is by the dynamic, throbbing motion of Kayn’s workhorse machines' spinning reels. But this is no repetitive work of loops and cells. Instead, a heavily effected mid-range narrative carries the listener through percussive, pseudo-instrumental passages, the circular washes – now percussive, now strings, now elongated bell tones – morphing and jaggedly shapeshifting their way along a clearly delineated line. In rare, isolated moments of recognition, a familiar snippet of another work might dart into view. But here, such fragments serve another process, a distinct intention.",

            "about": "Many composers have attempted to compose a music that reveals itself primarily in texture, from the impressionism of Debussy to the way Schoenberg’s klangfarbenmelodie later informed the systematisation of timbre in the work of Stockhausen and others. There are few counterparts, however, to Kayn’s approach to this problem, brought to a level of near-obsessive abandon in works such as ‘Sonority ERT’. From the clangorous depths of an atonal industrial assault to the dreamy sun-dazed blur of its closing minutes, here we hear texture as readily malleable musical resource – a sonic meditation.",

But as filtered detritus swings in and out of range like driftwood – given structure by gongs, sweeping fissural bursts of white noise, and the unmistakable tones of plucked metal strings – it becomes apparent that this non-existent post-industrial beach is in fact the orchestral palette inverted, and the very idea of instrumental arrangement is twisted back upon itself in a shocking yet compelling manner.",

Is that slowly barreling feedback or the tide-like movement of an infinitely stretched orchestral passage? Lost in the waves, we can only submit to the unremitting flow of sound.",

            "about": "The cloudy, sustained tones of ‘Spectral’ find Kayn in territory almost as weightless as that of ‘A Pan-Air Music’. In its opening minutes, dense flute-like timbres amass in an echoing plane of sound reminiscent at times of Luc Ferrari’s most disembodied audio surrealism. But this is no derivative (nor pastiche), as Kayn’s time spent amid the Staaplaat racks is soon also in evidence. As the work progresses, we find him locating, digesting – and perhaps even repurposing – the spiritual heirs of his earlier, uniquely groundbreaking work.",

            "about": "‘Superficies’ is a deeply immersive study in perpetual motion. From a rich base of Shepard-like tones, suggesting an auditory illusion in which throbbing atmospheres appear to be continuously rising, we find ourselves in the imaginary score of a journey impossible to capture on celluloid. Elements clash and are abruptly silenced. Overtones build, until we finally apprehend that these multiplexed machine voices are nothing less than a choir.",

            "about": "As strong as Kayn’s passion for the often tempestuous, pseudo-algorithmic selections of his machines, was his evident fondness for a sound world redolent of unfolding pastoral beauty. Perhaps this is the dividing line, after all, between composer and sound artist. ‘The Art of Sound’ highlights this ambiguity in more than its title alone, for however alien the sound sources, its effect – like Beethoven’s 6th – is “more the expression of feeling than painting”.",

            "about": "Following his retirement in 1998, composer and founding figure of cybernetic music Roland Kayn (1933-2011) did not relax the pace of his output. On the contrary, his oeuvre grew exponentially, and some of his most expansive works were to take shape at his home studio in Nieuwe Pekela in the Dutch province of Groningen.  Through the late 1990s and early 2000s, several of these compositions were released on CD on the composer’s own label, Reiger-records-reeks, which was revived in 2019 by his daughter Ilse for the momentous release of ‘Scanning’ (1982-83).\nHowever, the Lydia-und Roland-Kayn-Archiv holds dozens of these works, many of them as ambitious in scope as classics such as ‘Tektra’ and ‘Infra’, which have earned Kayn a loyal following among the current generation of electronic music enthusiasts.\nIn 2003 alone, Kayn produced 15 pieces. One of these – the hitherto-unheard ‘The Man and the Biosphere’ – now forms the first release for an exciting new Bandcamp page dedicated to works from the archive.",

            "about": "Kayn’s electronic works are often characterized by their density, as his cybernetic practices allow material to build from tones to clusters, and finally into his trademark primordial swathes of electronic sound.\n‘Triades’, by contrast, is a model of clarity. Drones exist only in crystalline isolation. Plundered sources are inserted nakedly into the mix, undisguised and often unadorned. Effects are used more sparingly, often only to bring certain sounds to the fore momentarily. Startling concrete stabs and shards of found sound are turned in the light, shaping the escalating tension into a near-meditative study in timbre.",

Textural washes are stretched until taut into almost choral tones. Tape warble gives way to arrays of submerged granular shapes. Kayn's limitless fascination with the mutability of sound itself once again approaches its apotheosis.",

            "about": "When plundered fragments of concrete sound meet the cathedral-like slowed tape drone in the opening moments of ‘Yellowings Conglomerations’, it’s tempting to see the piece as a deliberate exploration of memory, aging, and the inescapable accumulation of personal histories. The music is in no rush to confirm or dismiss this view, leading the listener through a gallery of disembodied fragments, rendered ambiguous through techniques like exaggerated edits or time-bending stretch. As these enigmatic clusters dissolve into the timeline, memory becomes something to be reached for, enveloped within, perhaps even mocked.",

            "about": "In Kayn's “Areas Without Silence”, we find a degree of tonal clarity and dextrous timbral manipulation that marks the piece as a standout work of the period. From the refracting, spacious tones of the opening section, the listener is guided through a hall of mirrors where the line between material and process will soon become invisible.\nThis previously unreleased and newly mastered recording has been published upon the occasion of Bandcamp’s Juneteenth stand for racial justice and equality.",
