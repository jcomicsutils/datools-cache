            "about": "A sprawling follow-up to 1999's conceptual breakthrough Empty Bell Ringing In The Sky, Ayahuasca represented a comprehensive survey of the band's exponentially expanding world view during one of their most active periods. Recorded over a period of more than two years at various live and studio sessions, the sounds here are the start of what came after - Jack's \"Red Horse, White Mule\" and \"Opium Musick\" solo LPs, the Black Twigs, full-on Pelt acoustic shows, etc. Most striking about the record at the time was the inclusion of several traditional tunes, arranged for the group's eclectic instrumentation. While the band had been performing some acoustic material for several years and let some sneak out on the limited edition For Michael Hannas CDR, Ayahuasca was the first release to fully explore this part of their repertoire. \"The Cuckoo\" and 'Deep Sunny South\" are traditional Appalachian numbers, played and sung with considerable skill and feeling. The sawing bowed acoustic guitar on \"The Cuckoo\" and the rolling banjo and Tibetan bowl accompaniment on \"Deep Sunny South\" draw a direct line between raw/folk music traditions and the deep, visceral drone music that Pelt concentrated on prior to this record. The performances here have a balance of unpolished amateur electricity and reverence for the material that really only existed for a very short time - after this, the players rapidly expanding skills changed the sound forever. Combining the two styles neatly, \"A Raga Called John\" features Jack Rose's very, very fine country-blues/Fahey-influenced fingerstyle guitar over a shifting backdrop of hurdy-gurdy and concertina, before giving way to tanpuras overrun by fretless banjo. Of course, on top of all of this easily comprehensible music there's plenty of ear-cleansing ecstatic drone, from the two long flotation-inducing trios for bowed electrics and Esraj to the wall-shaking electric hurdy-gurdy mania of \"Bear Head Apparition.\" Truly a record for our times, such as they are.",

Contrary to the Grateful Dead reference in the title, “Skullfuck” is a tight recording of a single, intense November 2005 performance from NYC’s Knitting Factory. The set begins with an epic group arrangement of Jack Rose’s “Calais To Dover,” (from his Kensington Blues LP) with Jack’s 12 string shadowed by Mike Gangloff’s fiddle, and the thick drone of Mikel Dimmick and Pat Best’s Harmonium and Sruti’s. The three part “Bestio” suite follows, with the group moving to Tibetan bowls and gongs, building up a huge sheet of sound which peaks in a brief “encore” of wild gong smashing.",

            "about": "Debut long player by the \"classic\" Pelt trio. This out-of-nowhere blast of creativity followed a couple of 7\"s that were in a more \"rock\" style and was quite a revelation at the time (it's still good for listening, of course). Brown Cyclopaedia was originally issued as a dbl LP in mid-1995 on the band's own Radioactive Rat label (the precursor to Klang). The pressing was limited to 300 and most copies were given away, so it basically disappeared on release. The music features a lot of drifting but edgy stuff, mainly guitar oriented but with some unusual vocal, horn, etc touches that they turned more fully towards on the releases that followed.",

            "about": "First new studio recordings from Pelt in 3 years finds them picking up where 2005's Untitled CD left off - delivering massive slabs of heavy, all-acoustic drone action. \"Waning Crescent\" is an ominous workout for three large gongs, rich with overtones and subsonic rumble. \"Fire Signs Along the Field\" offers a slightly jarring quartet of spare string noise, with Nathan Bowles (Black Twigs, Spiral Joy Band) sitting in on double bass. \"Cast Out to Deep Waters\" is an immense 30 minute epic that fits into the archetypal classics in the Pelt canon, in the vein of \"Empty Bell Ringing in the Sky\" and Untitled's \"I.\" The all too brief \"Crown of Comets\" closes the album with the chiming, overlapping ring of bells recorded in Virginia's Falls Ridge caves.",
            "credits": "released March 27, 2020\nPatrick Best, Mike Gangloff, Mikel Dimmick\nwith Nathan Bowles playing bass on Fire Signs\nGongs, bowls, bells, harmoniums, fiddle, cello, bass, New Jupiter Machine\nAs always, thank you Sarah, Emily, Amy, Willa & Tycho, Bill.

Includes a 12 min collab with the rhBand, their complete 35 min Terrastock II set (claimed by many people as the highlight of the entire festival and earning them the nickname \"The Hillbilly Theater Of Eternal Music\"), a magically resonating 17 min slice from a typical east-coast warehouse hippie party, and finally, a brand new home 18 min recording heavy on the Tibetan Bowls (and by \"bowls\" I mean instruments, of course). The live recordings are all of the digital variety and finally capture the sheer density and multi-layered force of their live sound.",

            "about": "Max Meadows was the third full-length release by Virginia trio Pelt. Recorded all over the place in studio, rehearsal, and live settings, combines the Dead C-like downer song-craft heard on their early releases with the massive group drone soon to take over their sound. Use of a wide variety of unusual instruments, including those of their own design, came into full bloom here and gives Pelt a sound very much removed from other groups working this side of the street. \"Outside Listening\" and \"Sun Is Standing\" send out lengthy waves of bliss via electric guitar, both ethereal and gritty at the same time. \"Hippy War Machine\" organizes the mass percussion heard on those old Amon Duul LP's and backs it with a powerful drone. \"Dismal Falls\" serves as a fitting coda to such an exhaustive listen, with its eerie, melodic banjo and bowed cymbals.",

            "about": "All acoustic epics from the \"classic\" Pelt trio lineup of Jack Rose, Mike Gangloff, and Patrick Best. Recorded in a single March 2003 session in VA by Mikel Dimmick, this was a superb distillation of their interests at the time (both alone and together - Jack's first solo records, the emergence of the Black Twigs as a busy working band, etc). \"Up the North Fork\" is a trio for banjo, baritone banjo, and cello - after the snakey bowed introduction, the fast thwacking of the banjos and forcefully strummed cello take over and whip up a storm. The other two tracks are lengthy ragas (one in C, one in D) with the virtuoso modal guitar of Jack Rose front and center. \"Pearls From The River\" features Jack on 12 string, dueling with Mike Gangloff on Esraj. Pat Best's thick, sonorous double bass bowing anchors the duet between the lightning thrumming/plucking of Jack's guitar and mike's arcing, sharply bowed half-time melody. \"Road To Catawba\" has Jack on 6 string, with Mike moving to tamboura. Best's bass is again the foundation, with whistling overtones rising from his bow over the low drone.",

            "about": "For almost thirty years and over the course of countless releases, the American band Pelt has traversed non-idiomatic improv, Eastern-tinged psychoacoustic drones, and—in its earliest incarnation—noisy post rock. The group once counted among its ranks the late guitarist Jack Rose, whose spirit continues to imbue Pelt’s music with a sound that is as forward-thinking as it is refreshingly unpretentious.\nLike fellow travelers Daniel Bachman, Paul Metzger, Bill Orcutt, and R. Keenan Lawler, the members of Pelt clearly possess a firm grasp of the American folk vernacular, and similarly honor this history without resorting to pastiche or cliché. It is this fundamental understanding of the art of the recent past that informs Pelt’s music, which one might call “Primitive-Futurist”; a Fourth World approach suggesting a Cumberland Gap Pandit Pran Nath.\nReticence Resistance was recorded live at London’s Café Oto over two nights in February of 2017. The album features the core Pelt lineup of Patrick Best on Grand Piano and harmonium, Mike Gangloff on fiddle, Nathan Bowles on percussion and banjo, and Mikel Dimmick on harmonium, bowls, and bells. The capacious, inviting sound of the performances was captured without effects, using only microphones on the acoustic instruments.\n“Diglossia,” which makes up the entirety of Side A, begins with an insistent hammering of piano keys and Gangloff’s swooping fiddle. Soon, Best begins teasing out a scale as Dimmick’s harmonium envelops everything in a luminous sound bath. The way the piece harmoniously advances and recedes, at first almost imperceptibly, recalls Coltrane’s improvisations circa “India” as much as it does ocean currents and lapping waves.\nWhere “Diglossia” suggests elemental forces, Side B—comprised of the “Sundogs-Chiming-The Door In The Hill” suite—sounds carnal, like the sustained exhale of a giant beast. Jack Rose’s evergreen composition “Sundogs” opens the side with reverberating bells and gongs. At first the effect is like standing in a hallways listening to four equidistant rooms: Best provides ominous piano clusters thick with overtones; Gangloff’s keening fiddle conjures a kind of microtonal Eck Robertson; Dimmick’s immersive drones swaddle Bowles’ various pecks, probes, and brushes at the banjo. Suddenly, the seemingly disparate pieces appear to gather at the ceiling and locate each other; everything appears to snap into place suggesting the slow transformation of a raga as it develops from the alap section to the gat. The effect is mesmerizing.\nReticence Resistance is a crucial document of Ever Weird America, and quite possibly the band’s finest work to date.\n-James Toth-",

Recorded in New Orleans and Austin on the band's monumental spring 1998 tour (which yielded their masterpiece Empty Bell Ringing In The Sky), Rob's Choice gives you a listen to 2 nearly complete performances, both superb expressions of the band's higher ground drone myth expansion and contraction, uh, that is to say it wails, and who doesn't love that Lowrey tube organ?

Using tamboura, guitar, violin, tabla, banjo, flute, lap steel, oscillator, voice, organ, and a variety of other instruments both conventional and home-made, Pelt issue forth a massive and extraordinary gust of sound. A logical follow up to 1997's well received Max Meadows CD, Técheöd captures the band at home in their living room, and live in Washington DC. \"New Dehli Blues\" leads off the record with 14 minutes of ecstatic Indian-inspired modal trance. \"Big Walker Mountain Tunnel\" follows with its massive wall of sound tempered by a carefully stitched melodic motif. \"Mu Mesons\" finishes off the record with a home-cooking version of the type of tape-loop exotica explored by composers like Terry Riley and Steve Reich.",

            "about": "(untitled) is a devastating set of almost pure white light. The intense drone music on (untitled) represents a return to \"sonic-ism\" for the quartet of Jack Rose, Mike Gangloff, Patrick Best, and Mikel Dimmick. Like Pelt's 2003 effort Pearls from the River, (untitled) is an all-acoustic affair. On (untitled) the group concentrates on producing dense clouds of overtones from guitar, cello, tibetan bowls, gongs, sruti, and esraj. Track 1 is an overpowering straight line ala the Theatre of Eternal Music, an atmosphere of stasis with gong and bowl flickering subtly over the massive track bed. Track 2 is a 32 minute epic that begins with the soft strains of Jack Rose's 12 string, picks up dueling cello and esraj and gradually builds in intensity with the sounds of gongs and other unusual percussion. Track 3 is the live staple \"Sundogs,\" where Rose's Weissenborn lap guitar and Gangloff's resonator guitar produce a stream of unearthly high, singing overtones in an uncanny acoustic impression of electric feedback. The final track is an epilogue of Best's keening cello, again ignoring the usual technique associated with the instrument in the pursuit of pure weirdness.",
