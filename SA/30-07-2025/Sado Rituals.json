            "about": "Inspired by the book \"The Soul After Death\" by Fr. Seraphim Rose and the belief held by some in the Eastern Orthodox Church which states that \"following a person's death the soul leaves the body, and is escorted to God by angels. During this journey the soul passes through an aerial realm, which is inhabited by wicked spirits (Ephesians 6:12). The soul encounters these demons at various points referred to as toll-houses where the demons then attempt to accuse it of sin and, if possible, drag the soul into hell\".\nFind the whole book here:\ndn721807.ca.archive.org/0/items/fr.-seraphim-rose-the-soul-after-death-2009/Fr.%20Seraphim%20Rose%20-%20The%20Soul%20After%20Death%20-%202009.pdf\nQuick Wiki reference:\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerial_toll_house\nRecorded in June 2025.\nsadorituals.bandcamp.com\ninstagram.com/gatesofhypnosandsadorituals\nfacebook.com/SadoRituals\nNearly hour long, doomy ambient noise wall inspired by the Orthodox Christian belief describing the struggle of the soul after physical death, when it ascends in the air approaching the hordes of unclean spirits trying to drag it to hell.

It seems I forgot to re-post this split of mine with Hana Haruna released four years ago :). So here it finally is. It has been released on tape by befriended Polish label Antenna Non Grata and I must say it's the most proffesional labal I ever worked with. All their releases are quality made regular CDs carrying a huge variety of experimental and avant-garde stuff. Be sure to check great tape series \"Make noise great again\" featuring Dosis Letalis, Vilgoć, Radio Noise Duo and others! Also, you harsh noise criminals, you can buy something artsy for your sensitive ladies instead presenting them another filthy HNW tape with dead bodies on the frost. It's Women's day, for God's sake! :)\nNow please go there and buy stuff - shipping costs from Poland are still very low!\nantennanongrata.bandcamp.com\nThis particular tape here:\nantennanongrata.bandcamp.com/album/antenna-non-grata-make-noise-great-again-vol-5-hana-haruna-sado-rituals-split",

            "about": "Crepuscular Rituals - Burning the Wickerman\nA wicker man was purportedly a large wicker statue in which the druids (priests of Celtic paganism) sacrificed humans and animals by burning. The main evidence for this practice is a sentence by Roman general Julius Caesar in his Commentary on the Gallic War (1st century BC), which modern scholarship has linked to an earlier Greek writer, Poseidonius.\nThere is some archaeological evidence of human sacrifice among Celtic peoples, although it is rare.The ancient Greco-Roman sources are now regarded somewhat skeptically, considering it is likely they \"were eager to transmit any bizarre and negative information\" about the Celts, as it benefited them to do so.\nRecorded on May, the 1st 2023 at the Wickerman ceremony by the High Priests of Crepuscular Rituals:\nKen Jamison - High Frequency Evocator of Solar Energies\nEmperor Sadox - Commander of Crawling Drones and Tectonic Eruptions\nOriginally released on Gates of Hypnos and Basement Corner Emissions:\ngatesofhypnos.bandcamp.com\nbasementcorner.bandcamp.com",

The essence of these rituals was the \"communion of the living with the dead\", namely, the establishment of relationships with the souls of the ancestors, periodically returning to their homes from the times of their lives. The aim of the ritual activities was to win the favor of the deceased, who were considered to be caretakers in the sphere of fertility.\nCrepuscular Rituals are:\nKen Jamison (Crepuscular Entity, Hana Haruna, Basement Corner Emissions) and Sadox (Sado Rituals, Gates of Hypnos).\nOriginally released as a co-release between Gates of Hypnos and Basement Corner Emissions.\ngatesofhypnos.bandcamp.com\nbasementcorner.bandcamp.com",

One such 'myth' found on several Ramesside sources is the tale of Isis and the Name of Ra. (...)\nIn this tale, Isis forms a clay snake with spittle dribbled by the ageing sun-god, the creator Ra. When the snake bites Ra, only Isis can save him, but she does this only when Ra reveals his secret name to her. He does this on condition that she reveal it only to her son Horus.\"\nSource:  www.ucl.ac.uk/museums-static/digitalegypt/literature/isisandra.html\nOriginally released by Gates of Hypnos:  gatesofhypnos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Conceptual work dedicated to Marzanna (Polish), Slavic goddes of winter. She is an ancient goddess associated with winter's death and rebirth and dreams. In ancient Slavic rites, the death of the Goddess Marzanna at the end of winter becomes the rebirth of Spring of the Goddess Kostroma (Russian), Lada or Vesna representing the coming of Spring.\nMarzanna is also the name used to describe the effigy of the goddess, which was ritually burned or drowned during an early spring rite called Jare Święto in order to hasten the approach of spring. The custom of drowning the effigy of Marzanna derives from sacrificial rites; its function was to ensure a good harvest in the upcoming year. Following the principles of sympathetic magic – as described by James Frazer – it was believed that burning an effigy representing the goddess of death would remove any results of her presence (i.e., the winter) and thus bring about the coming of spring.\nCrepuscular Rituals are:\nKen Jamison (Crepuscular Entity, Hana Haruna, Basement Corner Emissions) and Sadox (Sado Rituals, Gates of Hypnos).\nOriginally co-released by Basement Corner Emissions and Gates of Hypnos.\nLinks:\nbasementcorner.bandcamp.com\ngatesofhypnos.bandcamp.com\nfacebook.com/GATESofHYPNOS",

            "about": "Sado Rituals\n\"Atavistic Withdrawal\" refers to the concept of \"basic perinatal matrices\" (BPM) by Czech-born psychiatrist Stanislav Grof. BPM I, called \"The Amniotic Universe\" is the original symbiotic unity of the fetus with the maternal organism. Elements of this state can be accompanied with, or alternate with, experiences of a lack of boundaries and obstructions, such as the ocean and the cosmos. The extreme expression of the sacred and spiritual quality of BPM I is the experience of cosmic unity and the unio mystica.\nAccording to Brazilian occultist Marcel Ramos Motta, the fetus in the prenatal period repeats the evolutionary journey from a single cell to \"homo sapiens\" - recreating, in the first three months after fertilization, the structures of insects, fish, amphibians, birds and mammals.\nRecorded in July 2022.\nIO\n\"Everything has been arranged in the body by fire, in a manner suited to itself, in imitation of the whole, from small to large and from large to small (mikra pros megala kai megala pros mikra). Dry and wet, giving to everyone and taking from everyone, with the force of the sea, the creatures that suit it, killing the ones that don't. Cold and wet water is arranged around it, a passage for cold breath and hot breath, an imitation of the earth, which alters everything that falls on it.\"\nCorpus Hippocraticum\nlinktr.ee/iovisualartist\nRecorded in July 2022.\nOriginally released by The Church of Noisy Goat:\nthechurchofnoisygoat.bandcamp.com",

His main influences are beat literature, abstract art, Dada, Surrealism and others, with big names as Burroughs, Modrian and Kandinsky.\nMusically near of japanoise mindmasters as Merzbow, Hijokaidan, Hatanahashi, C.C.C.C, Violent Onsen Geisha and noise rock monsters as Swans, Big Black, Sonic Violence, without forgetting old-school industrial, free jazz, extreme metal, extreme punk and all the underground scene that celebrates noisiest sound violence.\nCyberpunk, obscure literature and hard sci-fi inspire Interzona, which name is taken from Naked Lunch. Philip K. Dick, Ignácio de Loyola Brandão and William Gibson are recurring because they paints an empty and hopeless world, without any chance of getting better days.\nField recording, extensive and not orthodox use of Digital Audio Workstation for deconstruct\nInterzona:  plasmodiumverminal@gmail.com\nOriginally released by Gates of Hypnos:\ngatesofhypnos.bandcamp.pl",

            "about": "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs, which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of the bones of the dead and everything unclean. In the same way, on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness.\nWoe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous. And you say, ‘If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’ So you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets. Go ahead, then, and complete what your ancestors started!\nYou snakes! You brood of vipers! How will you escape being condemned to hell?\n- Matthew 23:27-33\nRecorded in February 2024.\nOriginally released by Gates of Hypnos:\ngatesofhypnos.bandcamp.com",

            "about": "Kupala Night, (Belarusian: Купалле, Polish: Noc Kupały, Russian: Иван-Купала, Ukrainian: Івана Купала), also called Ivanа-Kupala, is a traditional Slavic holiday that was originally celebrated on the shortest night of the year, which is on 21-22 of June. The celebration relates to the summer solstice when nights are the shortest and includes a number of Slavic rituals.\nMany of the rites related to this holiday are connected with the role of water in fertility and ritual purification. On Kupala day, young people jump over the flames of bonfires in a ritual test of bravery and faith. The failure of a couple in love to complete the jump, while holding hands, is a sign of their destined separation. Girls may float wreaths of flowers (often lit with candles) on rivers, and attempt to gain foresight into their romantic relationship fortune from the flow patterns of the flowers on the river. Men may attempt to capture the wreaths, in the hope of capturing the interest of the woman who floated it.\nThere is an ancient Kupala belief that the eve of Ivan Kupala is the only time of the year when ferns bloom. Prosperity, luck, discernment, and power befall whom ever finds a fern flower. Therefore, on that night, village folk roam through the forests in search of magical herbs, and especially, the elusive fern flower. Traditionally, unmarried women, signified by the garlands in their hair, are the first to enter the forest. They are followed by young men. Therefore, the quest to find herbs and the fern flower may lead to the blooming of relationships between pairs within the forest.\nCrepuscular Rituals are:\nKen Jamison (Crepuscular Entity, Hana Haruna, Basement Corner Emissions) and Sadox (Sado Rituals, Gates of Hypnos).\nThis is a co-release between Gates of Hypnos and Basement Corner Emissions.",

Rather meditative than brutal, depending on who is listening. A simple story to tell.\nOriginally released on MILITANT LITURGY:\nmilitantliturgy.bandcamp.com\nP~R~Z is a new Sado Rituals side project dedicated to rather abstract approach to harsh noise and having fun with playing. This record in particular worked like Lazy As Molester, but with three lazy operators (all me) instead of one, and with no correctness-mocking titles and cover art. Therefore not so lazy, just somewhat lazy. Triple lazy means less lazy here. Whatever.",
