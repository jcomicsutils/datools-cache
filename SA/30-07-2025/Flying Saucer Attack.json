            "about": "Originally released on VHF as a CD at the end of 1994, this was the second FSA album, compiling 5 tracks from impossible to get 7\" with 20 mins of previously unreleased (and good) material. Similar in blend to the band’s first LP (also newly issued in the USA on deluxe vinyl), the songs hang together as a collection that improves on the individual singles. The two proper singles that make up half of Distance - “Soaring High”/”Standing Stone” and “Crystal Shade”/”Distance” were instant collectables upon their release, so Distance was compiled to make the songs permanent available. “Soaring High” and “Crystal Shade” are jagged bits of fuzzed-out pop genius; tracks like the mutant concrete “techno” of “Distance” and the two lengthy glissando workouts on “Oceans” and “Oceans II” offset the more conventional tunes, upping the overall impact when enjoyed as an LP.",

            "about": "Aka Rural Psychedelia, Flying Saucer Attack’s first album was released in 1993 after a couple of instantly sold-out singles. Released at the height of the shoegaze boom, the album is a blend of memorable fuzzed out songs and far-out instrumental doodles, sidestepping the rock bombast of many contemporaries in favor of a home-made aesthetic. FSA’s blend of razor-edged static, softly sung melody, and echoing atmospherics builds an atmosphere of dour beauty that sustains itself over the course of the entire program. \"My Dreaming Hill,\" \"Wish,\" and \"The Season Is Ours\" are couched in fuzz and whispery reverb, but are beautiful and accessible tunes, able to stand on their own in any context. \"Popol Vuh 1\" and \"Popol Vuh 2\" are straight up tributes to the now much better known German masters, steeped in the hushed atmosphere of the best Vuh records (if not exactly the sound).",

            "about": "Wish pulses and wish structure. Make the time to take the time to get stoned on reality.\n===\n\"On the list of undeservedly overlooked music of the last two decades, the recordings issued under the Flying Saucer Attack moniker should be near the top. While in hindsight one might conclude that these sounds were never destined to be ingested by a wide swath of music consumers, it certainly doesn't mean that that should have been the case. Just make a list of all of the \"legendary\" artists of yore contained within your ipod or droid and know that most if not all never sold shit during their artistic lifetimes. But are poor sales a positive reflection of the quality of any particular sounds? The answer is 'yes' in a surprising number of cases, reinforcing the idea that true genius is rarely appreciated in its own time, and so it is with FSA. They were certainly informed by the scriptures of Pink Floyd, Nick Drake, the early Creation label releases and Popol Vuh (they even named a two part instrumental after the last on their debut album). But FSA took the holy writs of these forebears as suggestions of possible paths to be further explored and not merely templates to be imitated, and thus created a wholly unique take on head music that they referenced as \"rural psychedelia\" on the jacket of the first album.\nSo take a flyer on their second proper album Further, as good as any place to start in their canon, and maybe the height of their \"commercial\" success, as limited as it may have been. Or you could just wait until Williamsburg collectively rediscovers the works of FSA and starts regurgitating them under new names and under new haircuts, and the kids can all, yet again, pretend the now breed are producing something original. I would suggest you buy this album instead.\"\n— Joel Leoschke, Kranky",

            "about": "Originally conceived as a \"farewell\" 7\", this EP instead neatly wraps up old FSA business on one side and finds the band with new life on the other. \"Goodbye\" is a noisy and weird collage that definitely would have been the strangest A-side in FSA history. \"And Goodbye\" documents New Zealander Roy Montgomery's (Pin Group, Dadamah, Dissolve, numerous solo works) only appearance with the band in the form of a lengthy and beautiful raga, sort of like a group version of a track off of Roy's Temple IV. \"The Whole Day\" is new FSA, and is a lovely duet between guitar and sampler evoking previous glories such as \"Distance\" and \"Popol Vuh I & II.\"",

            "about": "First ever reissue for this unique Flying Saucer Attack live album. Expanded with additional material and a new side 4 mix from Jim O’Rourke. Produced in collaboration with Dave Pearce/FSA and Bruce Russell (compiler of the original CD release for his Corpus Hermeticum label). New artwork by Bruce Russell.\nWhile rightly known for the folk-influenced songs and spacey instrumentals of their proper albums, the briefly active live version of FSA unexpectedly delivered a blistering wave of electric sound. Recorded at various shows in 1994, In Search of Spaces heaves with long passages of feedback guitar racket, broken up by sections of surging rock music. The 1994 live band focused almost exclusively on visceral, trebly guitar noise - which while always a key element in the FSA sound, was greeted by audiences with total mystification (and often disapproval). Following a few brief attempts to settle a lineup and play songs from their records, Dave Pearce/FSA abandoned live performance altogether, leaving behind this album (and a barely available CDR) as the sole document of his in-person delivery.\nOriginally compiled and released as a CD in 1996 by the Dead C’s Bruce Russell, this reissue adds several minutes of music back to the original program that had been edited out by FSA for being “too rock.” For side 4, Jim O’Rourke revisited the original 1994 live tapes and has made a spooky and brooding new mix of music exclusive to this release.",
            "credits": "released December 1, 2017\nMusic played and improvised by Sam Jones, Debbie Parsons, Matt Elliot, Rachel Coe, Dave Pearce.\nThis release restores the full original analogue mix proposed by Bruce Russell in 1996 but declined and subsequently digitally re-edited for the Corpus Hermeticum release. This has been restored and mastered from cassette for this vinyl release by Patrick Klem (Sides 1-3). Jim O'Rourke has re-compiled selections from the original 1994 source recordings into an added side-long piece (Side 4).\nOriginal source recordings by Simon, Rocker, Darryl, and the No-Fi Organisation.\nAnalogue tape collage of Sides 1-3 engineered by Tim Baird at rdu, Christchurch NZ. 1996, following a painstaking plan by Bruce Russell. Released on CD by Corpus Hermeticum, Hermes 018.\nCopyright all. Grateful thanks to everyone involved in this release.\nAll photography by Bruce Russell (1986), taken with a Kodak Instamatic in Arran, London, Harris and Lewis.\nDespite its height, the location of the London Post Office Tower was an official secret for many years. At one point Parliamentary privilege was invoked by a Member of Parliament in order that its whereabouts could be discussed in a debate in the Commons without risking prosecution. Regardless, it was the tallest structure in Central London.\nIn contrast the Stones of Machrie Moor are marked on all maps of Arran, where they have stood for two millennia, even though their use and meaning is utterly lost.\nScissors cut the thread of life. 'Futures and pasts': Neolithic-1745-1965-1986-1996-2016.\nHarmonic 33 ...and the past, are not so far away.",

            "about": "Phase two. The beat is the new thing. Previously only hinted at, this pulse booms forth in a bigger way, although still obscured by clouds, past pop music and into the direction of rhythmic loopery.\n=====\n\"This was the first Flying Saucer Attack album I heard, which was more or less around when it was released. And since then, I can honestly say I have listened to this record at least once a week, usually more. Aside from being easily one of my favorite all time records, I find that it also has many varied uses. It can completely erase the presence of an incessant loud talker near you on a flight, way more effectively than any noise-canceling headphones. And believe it or not, at high volume it actually cures headaches, which is a claim not backed by the FDA, but trust me, it works.\nHere is the beauty of this record: If you were to dissect isolate each separate sound in any particular song, it would be the most unpleasant and unsettling thing imaginable. I have described this album as the sound of approximately a dozen Lear jets idling their engines at different rpm. At other times, maybe it's a symphony of hairdryers and leaf blowers. But each song is the PERFECT sum of it's parts, all forming the most beautiful (emphasis on the FULL) songs out there.\"\n-Rob Barber",

            "about": "Personal selection of live material compiled by Dave Pearce for \"casual\" release. The centerpiece is \"P.A. Blues,\" a massive collage of bracing, full-on sound recorded at various 1994 shows. Moving through various moods and grooves, the piece is similar to the material on the out of print In Search Of Spaces/Live CD released a few years back on Hermes Corp, tho' there's no overlap in the content between the two CD's. Also included: the 1995 group's take on the oft-covered \"She Moved Through The Fair, a subdued performance of \"The Season Is Ours,\" and an uncirculated (and assaultive) 1994 instrumental rehearsal, which I believe pre-dates FSA's first live performance.",
