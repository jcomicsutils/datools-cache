            "about": "56\nAnyone who, like me, has, with some enigmatic desire or other, made an effort for a long time to think profoundly about pessimism and to rescue it from the half-Christian, half-German restrictions and simple-mindedness with which it has most recently appeared in this century, that is, in the form of Schopenhauer's philosophy; anyone who really has, with an Asian and super-Asiatic eye, looked into and down on the most world-denying of all possible ways of thinking - beyond good and evil and no longer as Buddha and Schopenhauer do, under the spell and delusion of morality - such a man has perhaps in the process, without really wanting to do so, opened his eyes for the reverse morality: for the ideal of the most high-spirited, most lively, and most world-affirming human being, who has not only learned to come to terms with and accept what was and is but wants to have what was and is come back for all eternity, calling out insatiably da capo [from the beginning] , not only to himself but to the entire play and spectacle, and not only to a spectacle but basically to the man who needs this particular spectacle and who makes the spectacle necessary, because over and over again he needs himself - and makes himself necessary. How's that? Wouldn't this be circulus vitiosus deus [god as a vicious circle]?\nfriedrich-nietzsche/beyond-good-and-evil/aphorism-56",

Forthwith up to the Clouds\nWith him I flew, and underneath beheld\nThe Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide\nAnd various: wondring at my flight and change\nTo this high exaltation; suddenly\nMy Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,\nAnd fell asleep;\nJohn Milton, Paradise Lost",

Trust your instincts.

These 'others' should perhaps have been locked in the attic.",

And let that wisdom be false to us that brought no laughter with it!\nI would only believe in a god who could dance. And when I saw my devil I found him serious, thorough, profound, and solemn: it was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall. Not by wrath does one kill but by laughter. Come, let us kill the spirit of gravity!",

And no religion, too'\nfortunately some of us are natural born preachers, as well as dreamers, full of L.U.V., hellfire and the desire for a holy war. A desire just as basic, genetic and natural as the desire to breed, or to seek pleasure and avoid pain, but yet surely, a desire more elevated, because of its pure 'wrongness', than that of maslow's hierarchy of boring biologic needs. Possibly the desire for apocalypse, that seems so prevalent amongst those who 'feel' (as opposed to those who 'think') has been given us by Gaia so that we might hasten the depopulation that will be necessary for the planets survival.\nhelter skelter is coming down fast. this is the kali yuga. and you are no fucking dancer.",

Nothing to kill or die for. And no religion, too'\nfortunately some of us are natural born preachers, as well as dreamers, full of L.U.V., hellfire and the desire for a holy war. A desire just as basic, genetic and natural as the desire to breed, or to seek pleasure and avoid pain, but yet surely, a desire more elevated, because of its pure 'wrongness', than that of maslow's hierarchy of boring biologic needs. Possibly the desire for apocalypse, that seems so prevalent amongst those who 'feel' (as opposed to those who 'think') has been given us by Gaia so that we might hasten the depopulation that will be necessary for the planets survival.\nhelter skelter is coming down fast. this is the kali yuga. and you are no fucking dancer.",
