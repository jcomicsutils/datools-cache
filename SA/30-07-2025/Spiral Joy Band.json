            "about": "Third VHF release for this southwest Virginia ensemble that specializes in transportational sound sheets. Derived from the extended Pelt/Jack Rose/Black Twigs family, Spiral Joy traffics in lengthy microtonal explorations rooted in the expansive tradition of beards like Taj Mahal Travellers, Henry Flynt, Theatre of Eternal Music, etc. The four tracks here are an evolution from the trance-like gong and percussion sounds of recent Joy Band releases, with the quartet putting more of an emphasis on heavily bowed string sounds. Gangloff's fiddle, which plays it relatively straight in the Black Twigs (and occasionally Pelt), cuts loose here with some of the gnarliest string scratching this side of Tony Conrad's \"Four Violins,\" giving the music a searing, visceral edge. The final track finds the band literally standing in the Atlantic Ocean, with their gongs and Tibetan bowls shimmering out a gentle lullaby. \"No overdubs, No amplification, No effects.\"",

            "about": "Debut album by this long running but until now undocumented Virginia group. Founded in 2001 by Pelt members Mikel Dimmick and Mike Gangloff with Karl Precoda (Last Days of May, The Dream Syndicate), the Joy Band concentrates on live performances featuring marathon unorthodox drone treatises for acoustic instruments, including Tibetan singing bowl, gong, sruti, and esraj. The bowed, rolled, and (usually) gently struck metal percussion anchors the sound with rich, resonating tones. The music is a cousin to Pelt's explorations on (Untitled) (vhf#90) and Keyhole & Keyhole II (both on Eclipse). Lullaby 1 is almost entirely built on the gongs and bowls, a slowly building narcoleptic trip. The 41 minute epic Lullaby 2 begins with Gangloff on esraj, building up a trance before the shenais and sharply struck gongs take over at the climax of the piece. Lullaby 3 throws some surprisingly melodic and active piano into the mix, evoking a long-form version of Popol Vuh's \"Die Nacht Der Seele.\"",

            "about": "Wake of the Dying Sun King is the second full length of epic meditative drone from this southwest VA collective. Like Pelt (with which it shares several members), Spiral Joy Band uses mostly acoustic instruments to create slow building pieces rich with human detail. The steady rolling of multiple Tibetan bowls, bowed and struck gongs, hypnotic fiddle, sruti box, and other instruments are recorded live in continuous performances that frequently stretch beyond an hour per piece. The performance aspect is key to SJB's aura - the variations in tone, approach, force, etc with which each tone is played and the clear, open recording (mostly in Blacksburg's Glade Baptist Church) highlight the subtleties of the music. \"Wake\" is a much more percussive set of music than SJB's previous \"Lullabies for Jeff Dean\" CD (vhf#94), with Nathan Bowles' expert percussion lending a lot more clang to the mix.

However, if you purchase this, you can message us your email address and proof of purchase (simply forward the receipt you received in your email) to  spiraljoyband@gmail.com  and we will get you the release in its original format (one track).",

            "about": "Born out of the fulsome Wisconsin winter, we offer you the newest missive from the past, recorded back in January 2012, to lighten your day here and now. Tracked up close and personal in the former Ark Majesties basement, Elvehjem is a fitting complement to recent releases: In the River, Open Circle, and I was Born Under a Wandrin' Star.\nOfficial Release Date: August 18, 2023.\nPurchases here ship within 5 days.\nRecorded in Madison Wisconsin a year after In The River (FTR 654), the latest record from this amazing trio (Troy Schafer, Patrick Best, Mikel Dimmick) breaks a bit with Spiral Joy's drone-dominant tradition. There is a crackling, noise energy curtain surrounding much of the playing here that makes me remember the sound of the Richmond VA trio, Pelt, from whom Spiral Joy Band draw specific inspiration (as well as two members.)\nThe listed instruments are bowed gong, gong, bowed bowls, electric guitar, bowed materials amplified & acoustic, mouthpiece and effects, modified zither. So yeah, there is still a patchwork of drones at the heart of Elvehjem, but there is little in the way of uninterrupted flow. The music on this one is a cascade of sound events with a feel almost more in line with the less antic inventions of Gruppo Di Improvvisazione Nuova Consonanza than anything inside the “rock” realm.\nBut there has often been a certain rockist element lurking inside Spiral Joy Band's music (which supplanted the overt hayseed elements of their original iteration) and the direction and manner of their clangor here has the weight of rock rather than something more ephemeral. The two sides are presented as discreet pieces -- “Shore” and “Shine” -- but they run together seamlessly, both displaying surface pocks and tremors with a pride usually reserved for magic tricks. The drones are often created with a searing metallic edge, and their spiky protuberances brook no guff. If that ain't rock, at least attitudinally, I'll eat your fucking hat.\nIn the meantime, Elvehjem, is a stone gas to listen to. And, by the way, the name is taken from a famous Wisconsin biochemist, and is not meant as a mean commentary on Orlando Bloom's obsession with the Dave Matthews Band. Although that would be warranted as well.\n-Byron Coley",

            "about": "Spiral Joy Band: In the River\nEdition of 440\nFeeding Tube Records 654\nRelease Date: January 27, 2023\nPre-orders available to ship now\n(we have 70 copies on hand)\nDigital and Physical Purchases here include the bonus track of the uninterrupted performance (A-->B)\n\"Spiral Joy Band are one of the descendants of Richmond VA's legendary musical juggernaut, Pelt. Active and mutating for nearly 20 years, the iteration of the Spiral Joy Band who recorded this\nsession in Madison Wisconsin in 2011 was a trio. Troy Schafer, Patrick Best and Mikel Dimmick play an array of instruments -- violin, viola, harmonium -- to produce lush tapestries of the multiphonic drones for which they are known.\nI remember Pelt getting called “The Hillbilly Theatre of Eternal Music” at the '98 Terrastock Festival in San Francisco. And indeed, that was a definite part of Pelt's sound at that point in their evolution. But since 2004, Spiral Joy Band have focused on and explored that particular niche with firm resolve. All versions of the group have reveled in the use of acoustic instruments to create tones to saturate the air with colors, while avoiding the technical shortcuts offered by electronics.\nThe two sidelong pieces on In the River, reportedly inspired by Ka Baird (from Spires That in the Sunset Rise) and the Minneapolis string genius, Paul Metzger, are open-ended musical discussions about the existence of infinity, and how portions of infinite space might be corralled in ways that suggest continuously expanding horizons.\nBoth the pieces are exquisite and function equally well as Furniture Music (as defined by Eric Satie) or active meditation fields, unveiling endless spools of drone in which a listener can wallow deeply. The closer you listen, the more you'll be able to hear. But even as a “mere” soundtrack to the day, In the River offers the kind of textural beauty that makes everything feel better.\nSpiral Joy Band are sonic explorers dedicated to very specific corner of the universe, but it's one that contains the sort of magical powers we all need more than ever. If I were a doctor I'd prescribe a daily dose of their music as an antidote to the rigors of reality as we know it. As Pink Floyd once suggested, “Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk.”\nWords to live by, eh?\"\n-Byron Coley",
            "credits": "released November 4, 2022\nRecorded one summer evening during a show at Shockrasonic in Madison Wisconsin. After being/living in the sounds of, then Wisconsin luminary, Ka Baird and Minneapolis/St. Paul's legend Paul Metzger, In the River is our humble paean to the evening. Troy and Patrick on Violin and Viola respectively, with Mikel on Harmonium, and the languorous pulse of Jupiter Jr., In the River offers promise for the respite of night.

            "about": "Spiral Joy Band: Pleasure is the Headlight\nuzu002\nRelease Date: 06/08/2009\n\"Featuring two members of the most excellent Pelt, the Spiral Joy Band swells forth from Blacksburg, Virginia, with a follow up to their album Wake of the Dying Sun King on VHF Records. This double LP set features recordings from two eras of the Spiral Joy Band. The first is from 2005, the second 2007. A cacophony of gongs, bowls, bells, chimes, electronics, fiddle, bowed cymbals, esraj, harmonium, sruti and electronics played by Mikel Dimmick, Michael Gangloff, Amy Shea and Nathan Bowles, along with a guest or two, here and there. Pleasure Is The Headlight features 5 tracks in total spread over 4 sides. The first three being long trance inducing meditations recorded in Blacksburg and Ironto. The fourth side features unique recordings, the first is a solo wind chime performance recorded in a gift shop, featuring the murmur of confused patrons and what is likely some truly wonderful AM radio piped in over the store's stereo system. The second track is a slow hazy day at the beach, with gongs, seagulls, and the gentle roar of the ocean. Pressed on 180 gram black vinyl and limited to about 400 copies, this album comes in a custom gatefold jacket with letter pressed cover art and silk screened inside art.\" - UZU\nPhysical copy of the 2XLP available at  uzuaudio.com",

            "about": "Spiral Joy Band spun from the orbit of drone-improv pioneers Pelt in 2004—initially as an incubator for that group’s burgeoning acoustic experiments, but eventually drifting into a thrum all their own. Their variable lineup is based around Mikel Dimmick, Patrick Best, and Troy Schafer, and their rough-hewn drones utilize a staggering variety of exotic gongs and instruments, both electric and acoustic. On Summoning, Spiral Joy Band enlists vocalist Dani Schafer.\nFrom the very first track “Lateral Waters, Languid Domes,” Summoning leaps away from the contemplative, avant-hillbilly ripples of SJB’s previous releases, and plunges directly into deep interstellar currents, tillered by an electric guitar that one could (almost) describe as “Heldon-like.” With the exception of the chaotic interlude of “Starlings in Deerwood” (which recalls the most explosive moments of electric-era Pelt), Summoning is built upon Dimmick’s monolithic harmonium and Dani Schafer’s full-throated vocals, which envelope and tie off the acid embroidery of Troy and Pat’s guitar, violin, and electronics.\nWith Pelt seemingly unplugging their power strips for good, the wild electric howl and kosmische ragas of Summoning exuberantly herald humanity’s inevitable plunge into the heart of the sun.\n- Tom Carter, 2018",

Recorded in early '07, it's the most percussive Spiral Joy document to that point. Nathan and Amy stir an array of metal, wood and hide through a storm of flutes, fiddle and harmonium taken from the Spiral Joy Band's four-month series of shows at the Twisted Branch Tea Bazaar in Charlottesville, then the quartet settles into a more stately float recorded at home. \"Dreams of David Crosby\" is a singular entry.",

Washes of reeds -- duo harmoniums, an oboe -- turn layer after layer of rich and fertile dirt, preparing it for the seeds to come. Features a couple debuts -- first Spiral Joy release to feature Emily's playing, and Patrick's first outing on fiddle. The third of the cdr's three tracks warrants special mention ------- a 41-minute excursion into harmonium over- and undertones that may go farther and deeper than anything the collective's yet issued in this area.",
