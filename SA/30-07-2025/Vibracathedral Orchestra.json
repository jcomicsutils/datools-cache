            "about": "2000 album by the classic VCO quintet of Neil Campbell, Bridget Hayden, Julian Bradley, Michael Flower, and Adam Davenport. Assembled from recordings of their weekly sessions in Michael's kitchen, the tracks here represent the joyous, celebratory side of the VCO - all forward motion, massed strings, percussion, horns, and little instruments rocketing forward in a swirl of sound. Compared to the more austere sounds of recent CD's like \"Lino Hi\" and \"Versatile Arab Chord Chart,\" the tracks here take off from where the loose hippy chant and drum action of collectives like Amon Duul intersects with the ploygot instrumental approach of mid-60's Sun Ra (ref \"Exotic Forest,\" \"Shadow World,\" etc). \"There is no chord formation that can be planned which creates elation or sadness, or any art which is profound enough to change anything fundamental about a person. There is just a resonance around us which musicians/artists are using or not using\" - Bridget Hayden on the VCO.",

Huge, towering drones emerging out of subtle string layers and vice-versa. I doubt that whoever built the church organ heard on \"Trinity St. Davids\" ever intended to have it used in the manner it is here. Bizarre Houses Of The Holy cover art by Yoko Hayashi.",

            "about": "First in a trio of limited edition new LP's from the ever mysterious Vibracathedral crew, returning from another relatively quiet period with an uncompromising set of outre' jams. Slightly reorganized around a lineup of stalwarts Mick Flower and Adam Davenport with frequent collaborators John Godbert (Total) and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man), the band here stretches way, way out over these six sides, taking in several different styles while maintaining \"that\" sound all the way through. Joka Baya offers up a first side of short pieces, in a high-fidelity style that is in direct contrast to the dark, smoky sound of the rest of the tracks. The percussive grooves laid down by all 4 members are overlaid with Sunroof-like shimmer, stabbing electric leads, gentle acoustic rain, and droning organ peeking through at opportune moments. The roaring side-long epic on the flip is a droning, phasing slice of psychedelia with Moloney's drums battering the tape in between long stretches of humming stasis.",

The groop (Hayden, Davenport, Greenwood, Bradley, and Flower) tore it up in various shady east coast venues and now after much collating we're finally able to present the audio post-mortem. The tracks range from the atmospheric (Fredericksburg) to the raucous (Philadelphia), covering the full range of VCO styles. Bower and Godbert pitch in on some tracks.\nLiner Notes by Tom Greenwood:\n...i've been busy this past past year, touring a bunch with my own band, and when you're far away from anything you recognize, and someone reaches out a hand...or a big 'ol oven mitt, in the case of neil campbell...even if it's just a support spot on a gig, or a floor to sleep on, when kindness is offered, and the joy of music is shared, it means a lot. and when we met up with vco in the uk, their music and friendship made the dreary island a shimmering oasis for a couple of nights in leeds and manchester, and their music made a waterproof impression that i will never forget. when i realized that they had never before played in the states, i put out a line or two, in hopes that we could arrange to get themover here...the next thing i knew, i was picking them up at the airport. the following two weeks i spent driving them up and down the east coast, they figured i was helping them out, and i was, i guess....we made all the concerts, plus had a couple of amazing recording sessions in woodstock, ny and baltimore. we didn't make nearly enough money to cover expenses, but they left with a small pile of cash...what they\ndidn't figure on was how much they helped me. by being of service to the fine humans of vco and sunroof!, by helping them with meals, and music, they gave me a piece of the joy they shared in an adventure\nof everyday life. thanks! peace. -tom greenwood, hudson ny",

            "about": "Return of the mighty “classic” lineup of the VCO with their first new music in many years. Here the quintet of Michael Flower, Neil Campbell, Bridget Hayden, Adam Davenport, and Julian Bradley (joined by raconteur John Godbert) feature in a set of upbeat tracks that put the group's radical instrumental strategies into a package of full on rock action. Recorded live using a binaural head system, the sound is nicely ragged in a you-are-there way, with scouring guitars and bleeping electronics riding atop the band’s signature grooves. As with some of the band’s other records, there’s more than a hint of the early Velvet Underground spirit here – if you wish that Cale and Reed would have been more into being an instrumental band, here it is. Includes download code.\nA BINAURAL RECORDING",

            "about": "Third in a trio of limited edition new LP's from the ever mysterious Vibracathedral crew, returning from another relatively quiet period with an uncompromising set of outre' jams. Slightly reorganized around a lineup of stalwarts Mick Flower and Adam Davenport with frequent collaborators John Godbert (Total) and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man), the band here stretches way, way out over these six sides, taking in several different styles while maintaining \"that\" sound all the way through. Smoke Song's more gentle exposition starts with Davenport's santoor (a type of hammered dulcimer) leading the band into a lengthy mid-tempo groove on \"Smoke Song,\" followed on the second half of the side by the short, quiet \"Cholita Maria.\" The second side's 17 minute \"Get it, got it\" lays down the tremolo and phase in a probably unintentional echo of the best Spacemen 3 comedowns, taking a pulse and riding it into an organ and percussion fueled bliss.",

            "about": "Eagerly anticipated overground release from this busy quintet of troublemakers is an immense visceral slab of rackety action. While certainly their most upbeat and percussive music ever, the 9 tracks run through a wide range of styles. \"The Slient Socket\" has a gamelan-like 5 note melody overlaid with a hovering drone. \"Magnetic Burn\" is the band at its most rock, with sister-ray style guitar careening along side actual drums (!). The two 20 minute epics that bookend the record are a study in contrasts: \"Ramshackle Sunrise\" has the heavy and excited buzz of the groop's frequent and unpredictable live shows, while the closing \"Goodnight Stars Goodnight Air\" is a gentler acoustic epilogue, gliding into the rosy future.",

            "about": "Second in a trio of limited edition new LP's from the ever mysterious Vibracathedral crew, returning from another relatively quiet period with an uncompromising set of outre' jams. Slightly reorganized around a lineup of stalwarts Mick Flower and Adam Davenport with frequent collaborators John Godbert (Total) and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man), the band here stretches way, way out over these six sides, taking in several different styles while maintaining \"that\" sound all the way through. The Secret Base starts up at full throttle, straight into the middle of a raw sounding live outing, Flower's overdriven guitar occupying the same sonic space that gives his signature japan banjo/shaahi baaja workouts with Chris Corsano their urgency. The sound is dark and rough, almost Xpressway-like in its claustrophobic atmosphere. The percolating Krautrock stylings of \"If you can't smoke 'em, sell 'em\" chugs along hypnotically for over 13 minutes to close out the side. On side 2, the entire 20+ minutes are devoted to the clanging free sound of \"Eyes of Wood,\" where gamelan-like metal percussion dominates the proceedings.",

            "about": "Versatile Arab Chord Chart is the second full-length outing by the quintet of Neil Campbell, Michael Flower, Julian Bradley, Bridget Hayden and Adam Davenport. Like their UK cousins and fellow VHF recording artists Sunroof!, Vibracathedral Orchestra usually works from a base of modal improvisation. Led by Campbell's sawing violin, tracks like \"Wearing Quid Frock\" and the epic \"Japan Banjo\" build up arcs of lingering overtones beneath an undercurrent of melody. They cut the drones in their life with extremely effective bursts of near rock, in a style reminiscent of the pre-Nico Velvet Underground (circa 1966 or so). The band's combination of clattering percussion, droning strings, and considerable sense of where to put the \"groove\" on tracks like \"Catching Loners With Blank Arms\" makes them unique among their peers. Versatile Arab Chord Chart follows the band's previous Lino Hi outing on Giardia and a series of intriguing and extremely limited self-released titles.",

            "about": "Public service reissue of this impossibly rare and choice title in the Vibra oeuvre, originally issued by the band in 2004 as an edition of 250. Featuring the “classic” lineup (Mick Flower, Neil Campbell, Bridget Hayden, Adam Davenport, Julian Bradley) that made “Queen of Guess” (vhf#77) and “Dabbling With Gravity and Who You Are” (vhf#66), this self-titled double takes a wild ride through the inner-workings of VCO’s stream of consciousness.\nMany of the tracks (selected from research & development jams) here cut in abruptly, continuing the informal, expansive vibe of the band’s other self-released items. The thick blanket of signature drone-fog is never far away, anchoring the tunes which veer from early Velvets-style rock jammers (“Thrift”) to swirling electronic mystery (“Clear”). On side 3, “Gist” builds up a looping, guitar-led rhythm like a lost A.R. & Machines track, sharing the same side with the pulsing “Flötz,” which rides a taut electro-pulse bolstered by group small percussion. This lengthy double concludes with the almost side-long “Minkey,” featuring the full complement of VCO sound signatures in one big hallucinatory swirl.",

After a surprise opening, \"Sway-Sage\" heaves with raucous drumming (courtesy of Magik Marker Pete Nolan) under the swells of sound. Hard to imagine, but this is the first widely-available (except for the compilation \"Tuning to the Rooster\") music from the VCO since 2003's \"The Queen of Guess.\" Music by Mick Flower, Bridget Hayden, Neil Campbell, and Adam Davenport.
