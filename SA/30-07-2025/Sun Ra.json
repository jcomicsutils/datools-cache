            "about": "In 1966 ESP-Disk' founder Bernard Stollman put together a multi-artist tour of five New York colleges and sent audio engineer David B. Jones on the road with it. When they returned, just 39 minutes of music was chosen to be released as the original Sun Ra LP Nothing Is... (ESP1045). Forty-four years later, Sun Ra archivist Michael D. Anderson pieced together some missing parts of the New York College Tour. Recorded on May 18th 1966 at St. Lawrence University in Potsdam, NY, this illuminating document represents the full 70-minute first set, from which Nothing Is... was taken. In addition, Anderson uncovered a partial second set from the same evening and some rare rehearsal footage recorded during a sound check before the concert. The over 90 minutes of additional material includes the rarely performed \"State Street\" and alternate versions of \"Theme of the Stargazers\" and \"The Second Stop Is Jupiter.\" Remastered from the original tapes and presented in superb quality, College Tour Volume One is a vivid snapshot of the mid-Sixties Ra and his intergalactic band.",

            "about": "This eclectic ESP-Disk-sponsored celebration of the Comet Kohoutek featured a fire eater, talking drums, and dancers in platform shoes, in addition to Sun Ra's Arkestra. After taking the stage ninety minutes late, the band expertly navigated its way through cosmic free playing, big-band romps, and didactic vocal numbers.\n\"Concert for the Comet Kohoutek captures a typically inspired night by Sun Ra & the Intergalactic Space Research Arkestra. Recorded in late 1973, on this date the Arkestra is guided by a musical theme composed around the idea of the Comet Kohoutek, which was passing close to Earth at the time. Typically, the release vaults between cosmic vocal songs that speak of Truth and other such brashly capitalized affairs (such as 'Astro Black'), almost straight-ahead big-band jazz arrangements ('Variations of Kohoutek Themes'), and frighteningly evil free explorations ('Journey Through the Outer Darkness').\" - Jesse Jarnow, All Music Guide\n\"...two things stand out. First, Sun Ra’s unhinged work on analog synthesizer (probably the Minimoog prototype that inventor Bob Moog 'loaned' him a few years earlier); if this were the only recorded example of his synthesizer work, his credentials as a pioneering sound scientist would be secure. Second, there's the excitement generated by the group's multiple-percussion attack. You can barely hear it thanks to mic overload, but the rhythm section cooks like a mutha. Soloists emerge from the miasma, then return. A few are easily ID'd. Alto saxophonist Marshall Allen's trademark cat-with-its-tail-in-a-blender yowl is omnipresent. Tenor saxophonist John Gilmore and vocalist June Tyson are there as well. A trombonist whom I surmise is Dick Griffin blows down the house on 'Kohoutek.'\" - Chris Kelsey, JazzTimes",

            "about": "More explorations of outer space by the spokesman for the space age.\nWhen Walt Whitman wrote, \"I am vast; I contain multitudes,\" he could have been channeling Sun Ra. The man born Herman Blount in Alabama, who claimed he was from Saturn, was equally at home reviving Fletcher Henderson compositions based on their original arrangements or unleashing totally free-form, athematic group improvisation - and many styles in between. It was practically a given that a New York-based (as he was in the '60s) avant-jazz performer as colorful and eccentric as Sun Ra would end up on ESP-Disk'.\nThe 1965 sessions that produced the original two volumes of Heliocentric Worlds came during the most extremely free-form period of Ra's career, contemporaneous with The Magic City (Saturn Records). Volume 1, recorded in April with an 11-member band, consisted of seven relatively short tracks (none over eight minutes); recorded in November with an octet, Volume 2, in contrast, was much freer and featured the side-long \"The Sun Myth\" and the 15-minute \"Cosmic Chaos.\" The horn players and bassist Ronnie Boykins have plenty of room to stretch out and take full advantage. \"A House of Beauty\" offers five minutes of relatively lyrical respite between the other tracks.\nIt's worth getting the vinyl LP of Volume 2 just for the iconic cover designed by Paul Frick, consisting of a German astronomical chart of the solar system and portraits of Sun Ra and famous astronomers.",

            "about": "An F-bomb saturated hip-hop call & response club cut...from Sun Ra?! While the most renown track in this omniversal opus is the atomic expletive-filled repartee \"Nuclear War,\" there is so much more to this dark mysterious journey through the mind of Sun Ra. The sprawling, suite-like 20-minute title track sustains a lyrical edge in spite of an open framework and textures, which encourage sonorities to surface and emerge from the band as if there was no human intention behind them. In opposition to \"Nuclear War\"' Ra's organ playing here was built less on bombast and sonic terror than it is on whispers, stutters, shivers, and swells. Fireside Chat offers a wide stylistic array, as was the artist's intent, reflecting his eclectic, seemingly irreconcilable approach to compositional extremes. With Sun Ra you get everything... except predictability.",

            "about": "Astro-Black mythology, astro-timeless immortality!\nAstro Black has long been known as a cornerstone of the Ra catalog. It is well recorded, features a superb Arkestral lineup, and successfully combines several of the styles in which Sun Ra orbited, from Saturnic jazz to astro-funk.\nAlthough Astro Black was obviously professionally produced in a recording studio, no one is entirely sure where or when. The jacket of the original release gave the date as May 7, 1972, and the location as “El Saturn Studio,” Chicago. There never was such an animal as the El Saturn studio, in Chicago or in any other town. Yet it was routinely cited as the venue for Saturn/Impulse! recordings, no matter how old they were or where they were originally from. Besides, May 1972 was the month that the Arkestrans had to pack up all their belongings and leave the house they had been staying in in Oakland, California, because they gotten on the wrong side of the Black Panthers. The road trip from Oakland back to Philadelphia would have taken some time.\nThe title track was a vehicle for Arkestral vocalist June Tyson, who had been with the band since 1967 and was in absolute peak form in 1972. Meanwhile, Ronnie Boykins, who had been Sunny’s full-time bassist from 1957 through 1968, was a welcome guest on this occasion. It is his ostinato that holds the theme statement together, and his arco that guides and accompanies Sunny on his space wandering, where they are joined by Akh Tal Ebah on trumpet, and by the ecstatically interweaving alto saxes of Marshall Allen and Danny Davis. A trio of wriggling alto (Danny Davis), mini-Moog synthesizers, and high bowed bass develops, with Sunny and Ronnie accompanying Tyson’s hushed recapitulation. This is one of the Arkestra’s greatest performances.",

            "about": "A stunning live Sun Ra event, recorded at the Inter-Media Arts Center in New York, April 20, 1991! Modern Harmonic proudly presents this very special Sun Ra recording, issued here for the first time ever! This concert was just two years before Ra’s “earthly departure” – and his keyboard work was amazingly strident and vibrant here. The Arkestra was in perfect form as well; this special night also showcased the Arkestra’s vocal magnificence with selections and sections powerfully performed by June Tyson, Michael Ray, T.C. Carney, James Jacson, and John Gilmore. Rarely will you hear the Arkestra with such clarity! Many Sun Ra releases were derived from live performances, but seldom did they have the quality or sonic-punch of this recording. We’d like to extend a big thank you to the folks at radio station WNYC, for perfectly capturing this event.",

            "about": "Shining sounds from the dawn of the Sun Ra Arkestra. \"El Is A Sound of Joy\" was recorded in 1956 and appeared the following year on the very first Saturn LP, Super-Sonic Jazz. Incredible is the fact that saxophonist Charles Davis, here providing the soulful baritone anchor line (counterpoint to Ra's formidable left hand), remains in the front-line of today's Sun Ra Arkestra directed by Marshall Allen. Shuffle swing breakdown jets leisurely, casually, masterfully, painting lush, postmodern impressions of ancient future worlds, of space, of time … of Chicago's elevated trains … Reaching for the sky, for Joy … The “Joy” coda dovetails magically into the intro theme of \"Black Sky And Blue Moon,\" before downshifting into another dimension of romantic outrospection. We follow The Nu Sounds, aka Cosmic Rays, on a faraway journey to the land of late-50s Chicago singing groups, the Arkestra supporting with quiet grace, pulsing in Nubians of Plutonia mode. An uncanny blend of antique blackness and bright satellites, ethereal voices perfectly in tune; thanks to Ra's disciplined coaching (plus Modern Harmonic's expert remastering), their sweet dynamics and exact harmonics are crystal clear. Flute solo from Marshall Allen. Hearts swelling like the full moon, ripening in the darkness to the point of bursting.",

            "about": "The outsized sounds emerging from the Excelsior Mill organ captured here constitute a unique chapter in the Sun Ra story, a dizzying phantasmagoria that offers a whole new view on what Ra could do. It might thrill you; it might unnerve you; it might strum your heartstrings; it might spook the living daylights out of you. Most likely you’ll experience all of the above before the jolting musical jeremiad is done. Pressed on violet vinyl! The CD contains the full uncut show!\nWhen you’re Sun Ra, you don’t need synthesizers to evoke apocalyptic visions and interstellar excursions. You don’t even need a band.\nRa is most widely known for working with various iterations of his Arkestra, but he was no stranger to unaccompanied keyboard expeditions. His discography contains solo piano albums, solo Fender Rhodes records, and solo recordings on conventional organ, the latter going as far back as his home recordings from the 1940s. But none of those instruments ever offered Sun Ra the kind of sonic artillery that waited beneath his fingers and feet when he sat before the keyboards, pedals, and multicolored constellation of tabs controlling the Wurlitzer pipe organ.\nMystic and magisterial, Ra comes off here like a cross between a demonically riffing ‘50s horror movie villain and a futuristic congregation leader delivering the interplanetary gospel. Brassy stabs provide the kind of punctuation that could be graphically rendered as an endless string of exclamation marks in 500-point font. String-like swoops and swirls dance across the top of the carnage, cooling the flames just enough to keep the whole thing from combusting (for a while at least) but never dousing the fiery fury that Ra draws forth from the instrument.\n- Jim Allen",

            "about": "Sensuous dreamscapes to transport the listener to the lush tropical environs of the outer reaches of the omniverse. Your choice of three astro black inter-stellar saucers or two compact saucers of \"Exotic-Ra\" bringing you to a lush cocktail party where space is the place. All packaged in a beautiful Chesley Bonestell adorned gatefold package with two sets of extensive notes! Sun Ra. Exotica. Incongruous? Listening to the 25 tracks herein will showcase that Sun Ra was, indeed, an Exoticat of sorts, albeit in his own unique way, of course. That Sun Ra hasn't been celebrated in Exotica circles is understandable. Though many collectors are fans of both, at cocktail soires Ra has never seemed to make the cut. This album aims to change that! While Sun Ra never made an \"Exotica record,\" such tracks are mixed in his LPs alongside idiosyncratic space jazz, post-bop, electronic freakouts, and his other sonic experiments. Never an easy categorical fit, anyone who says \"File Under: Jazz\" doesn't understand the stylistic breadth of Sun Ra's recorded legacy. It's a rhapsodic pandemonium of Afro-centric rhythms, Latin beats, ostinato grooves, and unissued tunes!",

            "about": "\"Nuclear War,\" Sun Ra's groove-infested x-rated warning, was an early 80s underground hit when it appeared on a 12-inch (plus the Saturn album A Fireside Chat With Lucifer). Ra and crew expose the deathly horror with deadly serious call-and-response, leavened with funk and a pinch of humor for better digestion, eyes gleaming in a laid-back, lilting, cosmo-gangster-lean. \"Outer Reach Intense Energy\" and \"Twilight\" are originally unreleased works, sonically extending the radioactive theme. \"Outer Reach\" (1977) is a soundclash of explosion and fallout, planetary screams, whistling missiles, eternal agony, detonation, damnation. Dashed hopes and dreams blasted to the farthest nebulae. “Twilight,\" recorded at the Tip-Top Club in 1963, exhibits Sun Ra's xylophonic electric piano laced with clouds of mournful horns, teetering on madness, an impossible circus, bordering on redemption in the wilderness of the Sun's possible return.",

The future rendered here by Ra seems more dystopian than utopian, and these 1975 guided improvisations are imbued with an underlying violence, alternate twists, bank turns, headchoppers, loops, rolls, sidewinders and drops. It’s a dark & glorious journey. Featuring the debut of the complete version of “Extension Out,” Pathways has been exquisitely mastered from the four-track session reel!",

            "about": "When you wish upon a star… that turns out to be Saturn!\nPreviously unheard Ra culled from the archives and compiled based on their association to that children's film corporation with the cartoon rodent. Pressed on earth on pink vinyl!\nJazz aficionados and Disney nerds alike will marvel at how seamlessly Sun Ra and his Arkestra put their own unique twist on both well-known and overlooked Disney songs. Pink Elephants on Parade takes nine songs from Disney’s storied catalog and recontextualizes them as beautiful, fun, and sometimes terrifying pieces of Afrofuturist jazz. The collection also shows further proof of how Ra was always willing to transcend conventions of jazz. Listen to the full album and you will likely never look at the Disney music catalog the same way ever again.\nOriginally known for accompanying Dumbo and Timothy’s colorful alcohol-induced hallucinations, this song is given a whole new life by Ra and the Arkestra in more ways than one. It also feels faithful to the original at the same time, with the cacophony of horns, drums, percussion, and cowbell resembling that of a marching band. However, the demented grandeur of the song is turned up to eleven with zany vocal lines (hence the high-pitched “What’ll I do” inflections) and other performances that somehow sound more evil and gruff here than they did on Oliver Wallace and Ned Washington’s version. Though the Sportsmen’s vocals from that particular arrangement had a certain creepiness to it, the Arkestra takes a previously innocent sounding song and makes Pink Elephants On Parade sound even more terrifying.",

            "about": "\"Plutonian Nights,\" the opening jam from the 1959 Afrofuturist classic album Nubians of Plutonia, is Sun Ra's quintessential, astro-majestic party joint. Among the top grooves in his immense catalog, Ra reveals his love for R&B is inseparable from his embrace of Jazz. (He once told bassist Richard Evans, \"We don't play Jazz, we play Dazz.\") Pat Patrick's bari sax morphs into a Fender bass, while the swinging flow of John Gilmore & Co. gives new meaning to the notion of 'Blowing' (Out From Chicago). Remastered for top-down cruise control and better breathing. \"Reflects Motion\" is breakbeat heaven from the groundbreaking early-60s Choreographer's Workshop sessions, long buried in the deep space vaults. Marshall Allen's flute whispers betwixt Scoby Stroman's drums transmuted via Tommy “Bugs” Hunter's ghostly signature tape reverb. Down to the striking reminiscence of the vocal melody pattern, a direct predecessor (two decades prior) to King Tubby meets Augustus Pablo. Inna Space-Fire Dub Style.",

            "about": "Featuring what may be his only recordings on the Prophet keyboard, these once lost performances expand the omniverse of Ra across a stellar set of lengthy cuts! All recorded in a single day and finally making their terrestrial debut!\nWhat happens when a Prophet meets a Prophet? The answer lies within these grooves.\nAmongst the hundreds of recordings issued by Sun Ra and his Arkestra, under their various guises, the majority were recorded in concert or in makeshift studios such as their early 1960s set-up at NYC's Choreographer's Workshop. Beyond those, roughly 22 albums were recorded at Variety Recording Studio in New York's Times Square. However, on August 25, 1986, Sun Ra and cohorts entered Mission Control, a state-of-the-art 24-track studio north of Boston, which was teeming with electronic keyboards and otherworldly sound generators. Nestled within that arsenal was a brand-new digital ultra keyboard — the Prophet VS (\"Vector Synthesizer\").\nOf all the keyboards Ra played throughout his half-century career, the Prophet was one of the most sophisticated. There's no evidence that he had played either of the instrument's earlier incarnations, the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 and Prophet-10. Created using microprocessors, a then-new technological advance, under the auspices of engineer Dave Smith in 1978, the Prophet-5 revolutionized electronic music as the first polyphonic and, most importantly, programmable synthesizer.\nRa was intrigued by the Prophet (surely by the instrument as well as by the name). Recorded during a single day, it's about time that these once lost performances have now been found.\nIt was a joy and a thrill to be sitting at the console hearing this music for the first time, especially with my fingers on the faders and knobs of the mixing desk. We watched the oxide fly off the 2\" tapes during playback, making this our one chance to digitize before they metamorphosed into dust. Welcome to the new Sun Ra album….35+ years after it was recorded. The Omniverse has expanded once again.\n— Brother Cleve (1955 - 2022)",

            "about": "Ra to the Rescue is one of the rarer albums in the Sun Ra canon. There's a reason, and it has nothing to do with quality content (or lack thereof). When Ra and his business partner Alton Abraham launched their pioneering independent Saturn label in Chicago in the late 1950s, and on thru the 1960s—by which time Ra had moved to New York—each new album was carefully curated, titled, packaged with a printed, illustrated sleeve, and promoted in ads and catalogs.\nBy the 1970s, when Ra and his band were based in Philadelphia, this process had begun to unravel. During that decade and the following one, Ra often issued albums without the involvement of Abraham (who had remained in Chicago). These releases—dozens of titles—were often hastily compiled, thematically mismatched, and issued in generic white sleeves adorned with homemade abstract artwork, glued-on photographs, and adhesive stickers. They were pressed in limited quantities and shipped to Rounder Distribution for sale, with a small percentage of the pressing reserved for the merch table at Arkestra gigs. Ra to the Rescue (RTTR, a palindromic acronym) emerged during this latter period.\nThese products arose out of economic necessity. The Arkestra was never a self-sufficient money-making enterprise. In order to feed the band, buy plane tickets, and put gas in the motorcade, Ra needed quick cash infusions. A new album, pressed in quantities of 200 to 500, could cover short-term outlays. Once issued and sold out, that album might never be pressed again. Rather than re-stock existing albums, Ra had a penchant for reconstituting the catalog with fresh material, even if it was juxtaposed with previously issued tracks.\nGlenn Jones, who secured Sun Ra's peculiar distribution deal with Rounder, recalled: \"By the late ’70s, the Arkestra was getting more frequent overseas bookings. Their LP sales to Rounder helped pay for passports, visas, and travel expenses. Whenever the band needed money (always), Sun Ra would select the recordings, send them out to be pressed, and Arkestra saxophonist Danny Ray Thompson would call me. Over the years, we carried maybe sixty different Saturn LPs.\"\nThe curatorial mindset behind many of these albums shall forever remain Mr. Ra's mystery. Some of these 1970s and '80s albums seem to have been programmed in random shuffle; hybrid pressings turn up which couple tracks from unrelated sessions, sometimes in clashing styles, often under new album titles. To the Ra enthusiast, this is not a bug—it's a feature. Recordings of public performances were often edited to omit applause before and after, leaving scholars to wonder whether these were live captures or studio sessions. Sleeve info was minimal or non-existent. Identifying recording locations, dates, track titles, personnel, and engineers would become a job for historians and archivists, who might disagree on details or simply remain mystified. You could formulate your own exegesis as to whether this was Sun Ra's carelessness, indifference or master plan.\nRa to the Rescue was initially pressed in limited quantities in 1983, but several of its tracks subsequently were reissued with incongruous tracks on the albums (commonly referred to as) When Spaceships Appear, Cosmo-Party Blues, Somewhere There, and Children of the Sun. Those album \"titles\" are in many cases simply the names of the first track on a particular side (these were scribbled in pen on otherwise blank labels). To complicate matters, some tracks were retitled for reasons that shall forever remain inscrutable.\nThe tracks on Ra to the Rescue were recorded at several locations over several years. Some were taped at New York's legendary (and now long-gone) avant-garde arts enclave, the Squat Theater. Squat was founded by Hungarian political dissidents and based in a cramped storefront at 256 West 23rd Street. Besides music, Squat was known for dramatic productions (from Chekhov to conceptual absurdism), which were staged in the theater's window overlooking the Manhattan sidewalk. From 1979 to 1982 the Arkestra appeared regularly at Squat; an unknown number of performances were recorded, a few released commercially. The Squat archives (at  SquatTheatre.com)  claim that Ra debuted there in August 1979 and performed on the premises 47 times, \"to become our most frequent guest.\" The chronicle explains that \"the fit between the Arkestra and the Squat Theatre was a natural one, as both were in essence creative communes.\" (Other recordings from Squat can be heard on the equally rare Saturn release Voice of the Eternal Tomorrow.)\nThe origins of the remaining tracks on Ra to the Rescue are speculative. The Earthling Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed.) calls them \"odds and ends from various [1984 or 1985] concerts taped by Arkestra members.\" Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive says they were recorded in 1984 by director Frank Cassenti for his documentary Mystery, Mr. Ra, at two Paris concerts: one at the Paris Jazz Festival, the other at the New Morning club. Many tracks in the documentary are fragments. The two titles included on this album which are heard in the film are different recordings. Anderson says \"Mystery, Mr. Ra\" was recorded at the festival and intended for release by Sun Ra, but was shelved.",

            "about": "Among Sun Ra's most famous and jet-propelled anthems, \"Rocket Number Nine\" is heard here in one of the earliest renditions from a marathon June 1960 session, with a staggering, swaggering, hip-bop beat. Ignition. Liftoff. \"Rocket Number Nine Take Off for the Planet Venus, Zoom Zoom! Up in the air! Zoom! Up!\" Paired with originally unknown recordings, including the driving, bossa nova-infused \"Ankhnation\" from 1959 and \"Project Black Mass\" from 1962. More energized and driving in contrast with the rather laconic subsequent versions appearing elsewhere, \"Ankhnation\" features a feast of traded solos from assorted Arkestral all-stars such as John Gilmore, Pat Patrick, and Hobart Dotson. \"Project Black Mass\" is straight from the Vaults of Mystery: Voice of the Cosmos in spirit-science precision. Romping, rumbling low tones, glittering, twinkling stars, wanderful wondering. Architecture of moments, milestones of Blackness. Extension out.",

            "about": "Sun Ra's angular yet strident and soulful \"Saturn,” recorded in 1958, displays bluesy cubist bop in perfect alter-dimensional extension of Fletcher Henderson. It's also a showcase for John Gilmore's sax acrobatics and supersonic swing. Gilmore dove deep into the Ra Omniverse; \"got the concept\" - as Coltrane described the tenor giant - hooked by this composition, and never left. Dual baritones of Pat Patrick and Charles Davis boil underneath Sunny, skipping lightyear intervals on the ivories. \"Mystery, Mr. Ra,\" recorded live in 1984 and originally unissued, is just on the friendly side of ominous. Its deep funk, delivered by James Jacson on the Ancient Egyptian Astro Infinity Drum, lifts up Ra's dark bravado with no uncertainty:\n\"I'm Mister Re, King of the Kingdom of Mystery\nI represent the splendor of the Magic Myth\nI'm not a part of history\nI belong to the Myth you see\"\nPart 2 of \"Mystery\" involves Sun Ra's conduction and Arkestral \"space chords,\" collective emissions of precision and discipline from the \"Ra jail.” Marshall Allen is heard on alto at the conclusion.",

            "about": "This is Triple-A Ra: Audacious, Aggressive, Adventurous.\nThese tracks capture Ra's electronic peregrinations during the 1970s and '80s. The Arkestra occasionally makes a cameo appearance but Ra commands the spotlight, not so much composing music as painting soundscapes with electronic keyboards.\nIn the collection we've titled Stray Voltage, Ra is not so much composing music as painting soundscapes with electronic keyboards. Ra doesn't simply play these consoles — he attacks, cajoles, and pounds them. He upends and transports them where they weren't built to go. Sometimes they fracture under his assault. He steers them into the zone of intimacy and combat. They emit whirrs, hums, jolts and squiggles, crowned by explosions. Ra's repertoire includes feedback, distortion, torrents, and mysterious beeps from far-off planets. With one keystroke Ra could trigger a sonic apocalypse.\nThese performances might sound like they were generated by machines, but there was a robed wizard at the controls. Ra turns this musical circuitry into compressors and transformers, dynamos and turbines. He updates George Antheil for the Space Age.\nThese works also have the character of soundtracks for non-existent films. There is tension and mystery, chaos and disorientation. There are ominous crescendos, futuristic forebodings, and thematic non sequiturs. Animation, science fiction, surrealistic noir — listen to these works with your eyes shut, or in a darkened room, and imagine the action.\nOn these tracks there's music redefined, science repurposed — and journeys into the cosmic darkness. Some call it noise. Noise can be music too. It might not sound like earthly music, but that's because Space Pilot Sun Ra intended to take you on a pangalactic excursion, for which he created the mixtape.",

Planetary bodies, eras in time, crystals, space caravans… Allow yourself to envision or feel a world away!\nFeaturing an album's worth of previously unissued recordings from the same soundtrack sessions! These newly discovered tracks are heavy on the prose of Sun Ra, as he and June Tyson bestow countless bits of information and inspiration onto the listener.",

            "about": "If you were going to envision the ultimate avant-garde meeting-of-the-minds jam session, who would you pick? Even the most hopeful fan of strange and innovative music couldn't have seen this one coming: on one afternoon in 1986, at Coney Island's dilapidated freak show, space-age avant-jazz genius Sun Ra met avant-garde \"serious music\" composer John Cage in an unforgettable performance.\nYou couldn't imagine two figures more opposite. Cage was known for his unusual approach to composition, using objects such as radios and television sets, as well as pure silence, as instruments, often encouraging his musicians to do other things at their whim on stage. Sun Ra, on the other hand, was a jazz arranger known for his \"space-age\" approach to jazz, adding free-jazz and surrealist elements into a musical form that Cage often disdained -- improvisational music. And yet, for one afternoon, they pooled their talents -- Ra playing keyboards, leading his small group and reading his unusual poetry; Cage \"performing\" vocal readings and passages of vocal sound -- plus his trademark silence -- designed to baffle and disorient. The combination is breathtaking, both organic and mechanical, free-form and totally composed.\nFor the very first time, Modern Harmonic presents the full and unexpurgated concert from 1986. In addition to never-before-heard songs and musical passages, this album at last presents the long-rumored co-performance between the two musical giants. Take yourself back to 1986 and a once-in-a-lifetime performance that you can finally hear as it was intended.\n\"This live album documents the meeting of two avant-garde legends.\" - Pitchfork\n\"This month?s WTF prize goes to John Cage Meets Sun Ra, a monophonic double LP released on clear vinyl by the Modern Harmonic label, which documents a performance by the two eponymous giants of the 20th century avant-garde in a Coney Island freak show in June 1986. With the whole concert released for the very first time, including 25 minutes of previously unheard material, it’s an absolute no-brainer for friends of the strange.\"\n-Daniel Spicer, What's New In Vinyl--JAZZWISE Magazine",

            "about": "\"The Lady With The Golden Stockings\" is a propulsive, forthright groove – a decisive, deep-space, pre-dawn party jam, emitting golden sparks from the black hole center which begat \"Africa\" and \"Watusa.\" Quantum-elasticity of temporal equations, bubbling bass, trumpet dancing on light waves, tenor sax serenade across the galaxy, signaling yonder... vessels... beings... femaliens... Pure poetry in sublime, delicate, rhythmelodic motion becomes \"Spontaneous Simplicity.” A centerpiece among the gently blissful, tender works in the Sun Ra canon, heard here in a \"missing link\" super rare, compact version freshly excavated from the '58-'59 era – this is the first appearance of the tune (pre-dating by a decade the stretched-out live version first known from Pictures of Infinity). Ra’s electric piano bass and the roots-heavy organic beats characteristic of the seminal Nubians sessions providing ballast, Marshall Allen's flute flutters butterfly wings, guiding the ship steadfastly beyond the eternal, to the everpresent; the other side of the end of time. The title \"Love in Outer Space\" first appeared in 1962 on the Saturn album Secrets of the Sun. The backing track here is from the intimate Night of the Purple Moon, originally a 1970 album instrumental, with David Henderson's vocal overlaid and issued on a Saturn 7-inch 45 in 1975. Henderson (known for 1960s work with Umbra collective and the Black Arts movement, performance on Ornette Coleman’s Science Fiction plus early scholarship on Jimi Hendrix), provides his own lyrics, singing: “Sunrise in Outer Space, Love for Every Face.” With the emergence of this vocal version and the ascension of the Sun Ra Arkestra’s mid-seventies popularity, onstage the tune became a quintessential Ra anthem, a vehicle for frenzied acrobatics and organ-asmic drum-orgies of hyper ecstatic proportion. Utopian yearnings of space commune Sun Children, escape velocity.",

            "about": "The first-ever collection of Arkestra vocal tracks! Over 75 minutes of vocal performances - audible perfection! Across the history of jazz, there is no wilder, more future-forward composer and performer than Herman Poole Blount, aka Sun Ra. Known as much for his wild on-stage persona as his innovative compositions, Sun Ra was the avant-garde bleeding edge of the jazz genre, introducing modal composition and electronic instrumentation before almost anyone else – not to mention bringing the space age to life with his obsession with all things extraterrestrial. Across more than 100 LPs released in his lifetime, Sun Ra charted a course to space and far, far beyond. Known primarily for his keyboard improv and freeform band arrangements, Sun Ra could also write great vocal songs when he set his mind to it. Such songs as \"Space Is The Place\" and \"Interplanetary Music No.1\" show Ra's unique approach to songwriting, using eerie chanting and repetition to create hypnotic moods. And Ra could get swingy when he wanted to as well -- \"Enlightenment\" and \"Sometimes I'm Happy\" are gorgeous ballads, as pretty as any Tin Pan Alley tune. Of course, it wouldn't be Sun Ra without his space age lyrics -- \"Take your first step out to outer space/You're like a little baby who never walked before\" shows up in the future-predicting \"Walking On The Moon.\" At long last, Modern Harmonic has put together The Space Age Is Here To Stay, the very first collection of Sun Ra’s vocal tracks - two album’s worth of mind-blowing tunes from the mind of the Man from Saturn himself. Cue this one up and get ready to visit other worlds in Sun Ra's jazz rocket ship!",

            "about": "Sun Ra is still trying to get our attention 50 years after dispatching this transmission. Humanity’s path since then makes his message even more urgent today. Years after Herman Poole “Le Sony’r Ra” Blount “left the planet” he’s still trying to reach us, to wake us up and to change our destiny.\nSun Ra and the Arkestra weren’t a traditional studio band, and every star in the vast galaxy of their discography reflects this. The origins of these records can be hard to pinpoint at times, but when it comes to Thunder Of The Gods, it’s a bit easier. “Calling Planet Earth - We’ll Wait For You” was discovered on tapes from Ra’s, Universe In Blue, believed to be recorded in ‘71. The raucous title track and “Moonshots Across the Sky” are unearthed from the ‘66 Strange Strings sessions. Modern Harmonic has once again paired Ra’s sonic art with the visual art of “The Father of Modern Space Art,” Chesley Bonestell, whose 1952 work “Formation of the Earth’s Continents” sprawls across the front and back covers.\n\"Thanks to Modern Harmonic, in partnership with Sun Ra LLC, soon you will be holding an album of unreleased Sun Ra music 50 years after it was recorded! That this music survived to reach our ears after all of this time is quite a miraculous gift. It sounds as though it could have come from either the ancient past or the distant future, yet most perfectly, it’s the music of right now.” – Christopher Eddy (Sun Ra Arkive)",

            "about": "Lost celestial solo piano transmissions retrieved!\n“These unique works comprise a precis of Ra's portfolio. There are jovial romps through tradition and remarkable, thoughtful expansions of it. Small wonder his work continues to inspire today's leading pianists.” - Martin Johnson (WSJ, NPR, and beyond)\nSun Ra was a master of misdirection. Tape boxes wrongly labeled—whether by accident or design—are legendary among Ra archivists. One can speculate about the artist's intent or carelessness, but source misinformation abounds on Ra tape cases, album jackets, cassettes, ephemera—as well as in interviews. It's as if Ra, in furtherance of his own mythmaking, wanted to keep historians guessing.\nThis project began as a misidentified tape discovered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive. The 7-inch reel, which contained a live Ra solo piano performance of 11 works—some recognizable, others not—was of stellar quality, and was marked as a 1979 Carnegie Hall date. But the program on the tape did not align with known facts (e.g., titles played, concert duration) which were chronicled in a Newsday review of Ra's appearance at Carnegie in September of that year.\nWith a prod from writer/historian Ted Gioia and further research by Irwin Chusid, the tape was eventually identified as a mostly unreleased July 1977 performance by Ra at a downtown NYC \"jazz café\" called The Axis-in-Soho.\nFrom a cursory listen to the found tape, it was apparent that Ra and Celestial were rehearsing, trying to lock grooves, forging a musical bond. They weren't creating masterpieces—they were testing their chemistry, with Ra occasionally calling out directions.\nWhen the quarter-inch, quarter-track tape was flipped, Celestial had taken a break and Ra vamped four solo numbers on piano, after which Celestial returned and the jam resumed. The solo pieces were extracted and added to the projected Axis set. Same artist, roughly the same period, same city, similar feel as the Axis recordings.\nTwo of the Variety works were easily identified: \"At Sundown\" and \"Everything I Have Is Yours,\" two 1920s relics which Ra had certainly heard countless times during his formative years. A search of the Ra discography indicated that Ra had never recorded either title. Here he even casually mumbles some of the lyrics. The two remaining unidentifiable Variety vamps were assigned titles based on atmosphere. Apologies to the composer if he had other moods in mind.",

            "about": "A Fireside Chat with Lucifer was issued by Sun Ra in 1983 (Saturn Gemini 19841). Like many Sun Ra albums, Fireside Chat offered stylistic random shuffle, as was the artist's intent, reflecting his eclectic, seemingly irreconcilable approach to compositional extremes. With Sun Ra you get everything except consistency and predictability. Side B consisted of the inscrutable 21-minute title track, while Side A consisted of three unrelated, shorter works (the wryly apocalyptic \"Nuclear War,\" a languid, atmospheric ballad titled \"Retrospect,\" and the soul groove \"Makeup\"). Fireside Chat was pressed in limited quantities, with hand-made Xeroxed covers (sans personnel or credits), and sold at concerts. Original copies are incredibly rare.\nThough a resident of Philadelphia since 1968, Ra frequently booked sessions in New York at Variety Recording Studios, under the supervision of owners (and his friends) Fred Vargas and Warren Smith. The association began in the 1960s, and countless Sun Ra dates were captured on Variety's soundboard. Fireside Chat, recorded in September 1982, was one of the final extended Arkestra sessions at Variety; except for three tracks recorded there with Phil Alvin in 1985, it would be six years before Sun Ra again made extensive use of Variety. In 1988 he recorded the Disney tune \"Pink Elephants on Parade,\" as well as the album Blue Delight (A&M)—and that was it. The bulk of Sun Ra's recorded legacy during the 1980s was captured live in clubs and concert halls. (An as-yet unreleased, but recently mixed, 1986 session at Boston's Mission Control studios is an exception.)\nSun Ra biographer John Szwed wrote that Fireside's title track \"sustains a lyrical edge in spite of an open framework and textures which encourage sonorities to surface and emerge from the band as if there was no human intention behind them. Ra's organ playing here was built less on bombast and sonic terror than it is on whispers, stutters, shivers, and swells.\" Spiritual implications aside, the title might secondarily have been an inside joke: in the early 1950s, while coaching vocal groups in Chicago, the pre-Sun Ra Sonny Blount insisted that his young protégés call him \"Lucifer.\"\nThomas Stanley, in his ambiguously titled 2014 book, The Execution of Sun Ra, observes, \"Throughout his life [Sun Ra] was consistent in his opposition to war and his art reflected this, perhaps most sharply in the space chant 'Nuclear War.' 'It's a motherfucker, don't you know,' Sun Ra and trombonist Tyrone Hill [joined by June Tyson] sing over a deceptively sparkly chromatic piano line played at a steady walking rhythm. It is worth noting that this spicy chunk of language is the only use of profanity that this author is aware of in Sonny's vast recorded song repertory.\" Indeed, the vocal and instrumental arrangements on \"Nuclear War\" are so matter-of-fact, so devoid of urgency, a listener unaware that it was a Sun Ra composition could be forgiven for thinking it was a parody of a punk rock anthem. \"Nuclear War\" is Punk Jazz.\nThe side A Fireside tracks, along with other recordings from this 1982 session, subsequently appeared on the albums Nuclear War and Celestial Love (although \"Fireside Chat\" appeared on neither).\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Angels And Demons At Play was compiled from two different sessions, recorded four years apart (1956 and 1960), that reflect Sun Ra's evolution from hard Chicago bop towards exotic styles that transcended easy categorization. The album was released in 1965 with a distinctive sleeve design by Sun Ra, featuring an identical illustration on both sides, and no sleeve notes. Besides the leader, there's overlapping personnel at the two sessions, yet the two LP sides were somewhat incongruous, demonstrating how much the Arkestra had evolved in four years.\nSide A (tracks 1–4) consists of four performances from the marathon 1960 Chicago recording session that produced dozens of tracks released over the subsequent decade on a series of Saturn releases. Two idiosyncratic works, \"Tiny Pyramids\" and the title track (the latter featuring a flute solo by Marshall Allen), were composed by bassist Ronnie Boykins. \"Between Two Worlds,\" a Sun Ra original, is a short, springy cha-cha. The colorfully abstract \"Music From The World Tomorrow,\" featuring Sun Ra on Cosmic Tone Organ and Phil Cohran on \"violin-uke,\" is the album's revelation — a short \"sound experiment\" rather than a composition, hinting more than any work on the collection Sunny's future direction.\nThe B-side of the album (tracks 5–8) goes back to the 1956 first Arkestra sessions, featuring Sunny's emerging \"Hard Space Bop.\" The work is solid, and representative of the foundational years of the Sun Ra legacy. Three of the tracks had been released as singles by Saturn.\nThe respective sides document two early periods of Sun Ra's musical trajectory. But by the time the album was released in 1965, neither side accurately reflected what Sun Ra was offering fans on the concert stage or on new album releases, much less where his music would head as the decade continued to unfold. Compare Angels and Demons to the albums Strange Strings (recorded 1965) and Atlantis (recorded 1967-68), which sonically and stylistically are, as Sun Ra might say, \"from another planet.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Art Forms of Dimensions Tomorrow, a key transitional album in the Sun Ra catalog, was produced in two sessions shortly after the bandleader's 1961 migration from Chicago to New York (with a brief stopover in Montreal). One of about a dozen Arkestra albums compiled from recordings made at the Choreographer's Workshop, Art Forms displays Sun Ra's increasing tendency to juxtapose stylistic incongruities on vinyl in the interests of showcasing his versatility—or accommodating restless attention spans (perhaps his own).\nAfter arriving in Gotham, Sunny set about broadening his resume by reinventing older jazz and blues forms while edging towards tomorrow's dimensions. \"Cluster of Galaxies\" and \"Solar Drums\" are modernistic percussion soundscapes, bracketing \"Ankh #1,\" a swaggering R&B rework of a late '50s tune from the artist's Chicago years. \"The Outer Heavens,\" sans rhythm section, echoes Third Stream chamber jazz, while \"Infinity of the Universe\" offsets a percussion battalion with thunderous low-register piano. \"Lights on a Satellite\" and \"Kosmos in Blue,\" both recorded at an earlier Choreographer's session, ground the set on terra firma with some stylish hard bop. \"Lights\" remained a staple in Sunny's concert repertoire for the rest of his life.\nLike many albums recorded during this period, Art Forms was not released on Saturn until several years later (1965), by which time Sun Ra's repertoire and concerts had progressed beyond conventional jazz forms. (\"Lights on a Satellite\" and \"Kosmos in Blue\" were recorded at the late 1961 session from which emerged the Bad & Beautiful album—which was not released until 1972.) Like all Choreographer's sessions, the ad hoc acoustics painted the proceedings with a raw, warehouse ambience—what we call \"Garage Jazz.\"\nArt Forms is one of the first Saturn releases to feature what became a trademark effect on many Sun Ra recordings during the 1960s: an otherworldly reverb courtesy drummer Tommy Hunter's open-reel tape deck. Hunter discovered the process while testing the unit during a band warm-up. He ran a cable from the output back through the input, creating a mind-bending feedback loop that could be shaped by adjusting the volume of the playback knob. You can hear Hunter's alchemy on \"Cluster of Galaxies\" and \"Solar Drums.\" Tommy was initially apprehensive that Sun Ra might be furious at the cacophony, but when he heard it, the bandleader was delighted. The reverb became a recurring instrument in the band's lineup (and later an overused gimmick in psychedelic rock). It is, by serendipity, Sun Ra's initial foray into experimental electronic music.\nThis remastered digital edition includes the complete session recording of \"Cluster of Galaxies,\" as well as a previously unreleased bonus track from the 1961 session, an after-hours quartet cooker titled \"Chicago, Southside.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "After years of self-releasing albums on his own Saturn label, Sun Ra signed with ABC's Impulse jazz imprint in 1972. A reissue series of earlier hard-to-find Saturn LPs was undertaken, along with a few new projects. The first premiere, Astro Black, was recorded and released in 1973 in the now-obsolete quadraphonic format (tho it was playable on stereo phonographs). The undertaking signaled a noble campaign on the part of Impulse producer Ed Michel to mainstream Sun Ra and broaden his audience, without any sacrifice of artistic integrity.\nBut the effort was doomed: the label suffered commercial losses on the project and lost faith in avant-garde space funk. Within two years, after corporate reshuffling (i.e., firings and hirings), ABC's Sun Ra project was abandoned. The company clipped the corners of the cardboard sleeves and dumped the lavishly illustrated gatefold LPs in record store discount bins (or as some disgruntled fans claimed, UNDER the bins). Yet the Sisyphean venture produced some worthwhile new music.\nAstro Black was a return to quasi-accessibility, away (though not completely) from the anti-jazz experimentalism of the late 1960s, and toward synthesizer-driven space jams. The Arkestra's horn skronk was still prominent, but on side one of Astro Black it was largely anchored by the propulsive rhythm section of returning bassist Ronnie Boykins and drummer Tommy Hunter (along with a battalion of African percussion). With Sun Ra perched behind his Minimoog, this is very much a 1970s album. But as any listener will attest, it's also very much a Sun Ra album.\nOn the 11-minute title track, vocalist June Tyson croons a siren song above bassist Boykins' snaking groove. About 3-1/2 minutes in, the Arkestra achieves liftoff, after which they explore some free interplay the rest of the way.\n\"Discipline 99\" is a loose, relaxed space walk with some fine ensemble work by the horns. The \"Discipline\" series, variously numbered and composed by Ra during the 1970s, were generally group-performed works which omitted solos; this recording is an exception, showcasing expressive offerings by John Gilmore (tenor sax), Akh Tal Ebah (trumpet), and the bandleader (electro-vibraphone). The percussion-heavy \"Hidden Spheres\" serves up some steamy African exotica, with Marshall Allen (alto sax), Kwame Hadi (trumpet), and Eloe Omoe (bass clarinet) intensifying the mood.\nSide B of the LP (here track 4) consists of \"The Cosmo-Fire,\" a sprawling 18-minute otherworldly affair of conducted Afro-futuristic improvisation unified by Boykins' inventive bass and punctuated by Sunny's synth and organ. The work provides an uncompromising contrast to the album's A-side, and proved that despite the major label upgrade, Sun Ra was intent on challenging his listeners.\nThere's a short chronicle of Ra's Impulse adventures in \"The House That Trane Built: The Story of Impulse! Records,\" by Ashley Kahn. The book includes the following amusing anecdote by Ed Michel, in which he recalls his first Sun Ra mixing session in 1972: \"I liked to mix at the pain threshold. It was really loud. We were mixing it quadraphonically in a relatively small room. Sun Ra was sleeping deep and snoring loud. For some reason, I stopped the tape in the middle of the tune. He came awake, wheeled his head like an owl does—all around the room, checking everything out. He said, 'You Earth people sleep too much.'

            "about": "The Atlantis LP, recorded in New York in 1967 and 1968, was in effect a pair of EPs, as the two sides radically differed. Side one (tracks 1–5 on this digital release), recorded at Sun Studios, consisted of short rhythmic works arranged around the Hohner Clavinet, which Ra dubbed the \"Solar Sound Instrument.\" This keyboard had only been on the market about a year before Sunny adopted it as a featured instrument, pairing its electronic pulses with saxophone and African-style percussion.\nThe version of \"Yucatan\" that appeared on the Saturn LP was the first half of a longer, two-part work. An edited portion of the second half, different from the first but similarly titled \"Yucatan,\" appeared on a 1972 Impulse! LP reissue in place of the Saturn LP version. For this remastered edition, we have included both versions, herein titled \"Yucatan I\" and \"Yucatan II\" (which appears here in full, two minutes longer than the Impulse! track).\nSide two of the LP featured the title track — an epic, 22-minute sonic tapestry, built around Sunny's aggressive free (or \"Space\") jazz keyboard improvisations, with the band sporadically joining the fray. It was recorded at the Olatunji Center of African Culture at 125th Street and Lexington Avenue, in New York, in August 1967. During this period, the Nigerian drummer Babatunde Olatunji and Sun Ra had become friends and often shared ideas on music and African culture.\n\"Atlantis\" is an overpowering—and at times frightful—assault which refuses to coalesce into any conventional structure, and augurs Sun Ra's increasingly adventurous performances in the 1970s. The keyboards used were a Clavioline and a Gibson Kalamazoo Organ (which Ra re-christened the \"Solar Sound Organ\"). During this performance, according to biographer John Szwed, \"Sun Ra rolled his hands on the keys, pressing his forearm along the keyboard, played with his hands upside-down, slashing and beating the keyboard, spinning around and around, his hands windmilling at the keys—a virtual sonic representation of the flooding of Atlantis.\" It is an uncompromising work by an artist unafraid to challenge his audience. The original 45-minute performance was projected for a full album, running across two sides. However, it was edited to fit onto one side of an LP, and is here presented in its commercially released form. A release of the complete recording is in our project queue.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Considering the monumental size of Sun Ra's recorded oeuvre, there are surprisingly few solo piano albums in the catalog of this keyboard colossus, and very few on his own Saturn label. Other than Monorails and Satellites Vols. 1 and 2, both recorded around 1966, Aurora Borealis is the only other known Saturn release exclusively featuring solo piano. Solo 88's are scattered across numerous other Saturn LPs, and there's a handful of such excursions on other labels.\nIt's a mystery where the Aurora tracks originated, and perhaps when. The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed.), by Robert Campbell and Christopher Trent, attributes the four tracks to a live performance at an unknown location on Dec. 4, 1980, and adds that the album (Saturn 12480/10480) first appeared that same year (with some extant copies titled Ra Rachmaninoff). The LP label displayed a 1981 phonoright.\nBefore he became Sun Ra, young Herman Blount attended Alabama A&M University in Huntsville as a music education major. He received much classical training, with Chopin, Rachmaninoff, and Gershwin (show tunes and grand concert works) becoming favorites. In his 1950s Chicago years Sunny often warmed up with classical repertoire. On Aurora, Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C♯ Minor gets an aggressive Glenn Gould-meets-Conlon Nancarrow makeover, followed by the meditative \"Quiet Ecstasy.\" The title track continues the reflective mood, punctuated by discordant thunder, which evolves into a hailstorm of notes and clusters on the LP's closer, \"Omniscience.\"\nWe round out this digital edition with three contemporaneous solo piano bonus tracks. The first, \"Rumpelstiltskin,\" only appeared on a now-rare 1980 Saturn LP entitled I, Pharaoh. Believed to have been recorded in 1979 at an unidentified location (possibly Grendel’s Lair in Philadelphia), I, Pharaoh includes two other tracks, both featuring Sun Ra & His Arkestra, and both plagued by inferior audio. Because \"Rumpelstiltskin\" was recorded in the same time frame as Aurora Borealis, and because its sound quality is acceptable, this track has been rescued from its Pharaonic oblivion and added to this release. The recording is stereo, and the title does not otherwise recur in the massive Ra discography.\nNext we have \"Over the Rainbow,\" a perennial Ra favorite. This beautifully recorded rendition was performed live at the Moers Music Festival, West Germany, on June 1, 1979. This track has not been previously released commercially, and it is a BANDCAMP EXCLUSIVE.\nFinally, we cap the set with Ra's evergreen \"Love in Outer Space,\" recorded during soundcheck before an August 1979 performance at NYC's Squat Theater. This recording has never before been commercially issued. The backdrop of creaky piano bench, stage noise, and casual conversation are to be considered part of the work; think of it as John Cage's 4:33 with notes.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "The Bad and Beautiful was the first album recorded in New York by Sun Ra after he arrived from Chicago with a small contingent of the Arkestra in 1961. Its release was delayed for 11 years, finally appearing on Sunny's Saturn label in 1972. The album consists of four Sun Ra originals and three standards recorded by a sextet consisting of the leader on piano, accompanied by mainstays John Gilmore, Pat Patrick, Marshall Allen, Ronnie Boykins, and Tommy Hunter.\nThe album finds the band at a transitional stage between the \"hard space bop\" of their Chicago days and the avant-garde direction Sunny's music would take in the 1960s. A superficial listen would seem to indicate the repertoire and style were retrospective, yet it's evident from countless flourishes in the arranging and performing that a group of brash newcomers had arrived on the Gotham scene. Despite a string of late 1960s Saturn LP pressings of recordings made in Chicago from 1956 to 1961, upon their arrival on the east coast Sunny and his ensemble began progressing beyond what passed for \"polite\" jazz. New York changed Sunny irrevocably by inspiring and challenging him. He didn't just find himself in a new city; he began exploring the deeper cosmos.\nIn many ways, Bad and Beautiful is a resume. It lays out what Sunny had learned as a pianist, composer, bandleader, and arranger during his Chicago years (and earlier growing up in Birmingham). It also presents the Arkestra as a tight-knit, yet relaxed ensemble, a team of professionals who play to each others' strengths with mutual respect. The album seems to say: This is who we are, this is what we did, we hope you like it, but don't expect us to continue in this fashion.\nThen there's the issue of sonic quality. Bad and Beautiful sounds like it was recorded in a basement. In fact, it was: at the Choreographer's Workshop, 414 West 51st Street, which was the Arkestra's rehearsal space for several years after they arrived in NYC. The album's title thus acquires secondary implications: under bad conditions, beautiful music can be made. There's a genre called \"garage rock.\" This is \"garage jazz.\"\nTwo years after its delayed 1972 release, Bad and Beautiful was reissued with a lavish gatefold cover as part of a planned series of Saturn reissues and new recordings Sun Ra would make for the prestigious Impulse! jazz label. (That deal fell apart in two years, and a number of scheduled reissues and new projects were abandoned.) The Impulse! LP included the following technical note: \"Many of the early Saturn recordings were recorded under less than optimum circumstances, and listeners are advised that certain portions of this album do not reach the standards of state-of-the-art recordings of the mid-1970s.\" That said, Impulse! proceeded to \"fix\" this admittedly \"less than optimum\" recording by mixing the monophonic tapes into fake \"stereo\" (attempting to replicate what had been lamentably done on the Saturn LP). Highs were boosted on one channel, lows on the other, producing a disorienting balance in which the left channel was noticeably inferior to the right. In addition, the tape was marred by sporadic flutter and dropouts, the tape speed ran slow, and the prevailing analog format made it difficult to remove transient noise while retaining the glorious lo-fi racket captured at the Choreographer's Workshop in 1961.\nOn this digital reissue we have retained the monophonic format. Working from the original tapes, we repaired a number of audio flaws and removed a scintilla of tape hiss, while retaining the raw energy captured by a historic band making great music in a less-than-ideal environment. These recordings aren't perfect. They will never be perfect. Trying to perfect them might inadvertently remove a layer of soul.\nThis remastered edition includes a previously unreleased session track, \"Street of Dreams,\" featuring Pat Patrick showcased on baritone sax in a quartet setting. It appears here as track four, as found in sequence on the tape.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "This is not a Sun Ra album, nor does it sound like a Sun Ra album—but Sun Ra and various members of his Arkestra are on it. This 1966 budget-label project was an attempt by producer Tom Wilson (1931–1978) to cash in on the Batman craze launched by the popular superhero comic book-turned-campy TV series.\n\"The Sensational Guitars of Dan and Dale\" were not a real group—it was a marquee name for a rotating cast of session pros earning rent money by playing on hastily recorded albums intended to turn quick bucks on various musical and cultural fashions. There are at least 20 \"Dan & Dale\" albums listed at Discogs, most issued on the Diplomat label. To the best of anyone's knowledge, there were no musicians named Dan or Dale involved. In fact, few, if any, musicians have been identified from any D&D projects—\"Batman\" being a notable exception, and for good reason.\nWilson had produced Sun Ra's first LP, Jazz by Sun Ra, in 1957 for Wilson's short-lived (but legendary) Cambridge-based Transition label. After Ra relocated from Chicago to New York in 1961, Wilson contacted Sunny, booked him in a Newark NJ studio, and produced The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra, issued in 1962 on Savoy.\nThe Batman project occurred after Wilson's resignation from a staff producer position at Columbia Records, where he helmed albums by Bob Dylan, Simon & Garfunkel, Eddie Harris, Herbie Mann, and others. By 1966, Wilson had begun selling his services to the highest bidder as a freelancer, and produced many historic projects for MGM-Verve, including the first two albums by the Mothers of Invention, the first two Velvet Underground releases, and albums by Nico, Hugh Masekela, Eric Burdon and the Animals, and others. (More info:  www.ProducerTomWilson.com  )\nDespite the Batman album's notoriety among Ra collectors and cognoscenti, Sun Ra was not originally slated to play on it. His involvement was purely circumstantial.\nWilson had invited members of The Blues Project to play on the session. According to the band's keyboardist, Al Kooper, the group wasn't told in advance about the \"Batman\" theme—they were just hired to show up, play, and get paid. Blues Project guitarists Danny Kalb and Steve Katz, bassist Andy Kulberg, and drummer Roy Blumenfeld turned up. But Kooper declined. The gig coincided with his father's 50th birthday party, which Kooper didn't want to miss. So Wilson had to find an organist to replace Kooper.\nSun Ra was Al Kooper's replacement. Sunny brought along Arkestra saxophonists John Gilmore and Pat Patrick, and several other session pros also appeared on the date.\nKooper has long been listed as having performed on this album. But he ain't on it. I interviewed him several times in 2017 and he was insistent about this. Furthermore, Kooper says he never met Sun Ra.\nAs for the music, it's fun, but hardly groundbreaking. The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, offers this critical assessment: \"Except for the Batman theme, nearly all of the music on this album was plundered from various sources. 'Batman’s Batmorang' uses the slow movement of Tchaikovsky’s Fifth Symphony; 'Penguin’s Umbrella' takes over Chopin’s A-flat Polonaise; 'Batman and Robin Swing' is based on the love theme from Tchaikovsky’s Romeo and Juliet; and 'Batmobile Wheels' makes do with Bach’s Minuet in G, already recycled as ['A Lover's Concerto'] by the Toys. 'The Riddler’s Retreat' lifts its guitar licks from 'She Loves You' by the Beatles.\"\nThis album has been bootlegged countless times over the decades. As long as we're cataloging Sun Ra's discography on Bandcamp, we figured we'd offer a Batman bootleg too. We claim no rights in the recordings or the compositions. In Sun Ra's monumental catalog, the Batman album is a mere footnote.\n— Irwin Chusid",

            "about": "From The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed.), by Robert Campbell and Christopher Trent, we offer this preface:\n\"The Arkestra was 'in residency' at the Jazz Center in Detroit for nearly a week (a poster in the possession of [drummer] Samarai Celestial advertises 11 shows [from December 26, 1980 to January 1, 1981]). Rick Steiger and John Sinclair produced the events. Paintings from Ra's private collection were on display in the hall; films from his collection were shown, and a slide show called Sun Ra Through the Ages, featuring photography by Leni Sinclair, was presented.\"\nFrom over 26 hours of music (which included some afternoon workshops) recorded on six dates, material was culled for two LPs released on Ra's own label: Beyond the Purple Star Zone (released 1981), and Oblique Parallax (released 1982). The title track of Beyond the Purple Star Zone and the first section of \"Journey Stars Beyond\" on Oblique Parallax are the same performance, but with different mixes.\nThough nominally credited to Sun Ra's Omniverse Jet-Set Arkestra (a shifting cast of Arkestra mainstays and Detroit-based players), Beyond the Purple Star Zone in fact features the leader performing solo on tracks 3 and 5 (there's a 15-second Samarai Celestial drum intro on 3), while title track 1 offers the trio of Ra on keyboards, Vincent Chancey on French horn, and Celestial on drums. And despite four horn players listed in the personnel, there are few horn parts; other than Chancey on track 1, the others are on track 2 (with sax virtuoso John Gilmore singing), a reinvention of Ra's evergreen \"Rocket Number 9.\"\nThe audio quality of these recordings is comparable to many captured Sun Ra stage shows: flawed, but soulful; mid-fidelity, but high-octane. We have attempted to remove as much distortion as possible from the horns, voices, and keyboards, but ultimately this noise is part of the documented performance and cannot easily be subtracted by existing technology. File under: \"Garage Jazz.\"\nIn 2010 the British label Art Yard packaged the contents of both LPs on a commercial CD, which included fascinating reminiscences by Steiger, co-producer of Sun Ra's historic Detroit stand. Other soundboard tapes from the Detroit concerts have circulated among fans over the years, and some have been issued on inferior-quality bootlegs.\nBefore the first concert, Ra was reportedly given the Key to the City by an aide to Detroit Mayor Coleman Young.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "NOTE: Celestial Love, first issued digitally by us in 2015, was licensed to the Modern Harmonic label and remastered in 2020. Both versions contain identical titles. The remastered version is available on CD and LP (and digitally) from MH. Our Bandcamp release has been updated with the remastered audio.\n========\nCelestial Love contains recordings made in September 1982 at New York's Variety Studios, which had hosted countless Sun Ra sessions since the late 1960s. This was one of the last extended sessions at Variety, and these recordings were the last studio works released on Sun Ra's own Saturn label (though the label did continue to press concert recordings, and new studio recordings did appear on other labels). Aside from their inclusion on Celestial Love, tracks from these sessions landed on the albums A Fireside Chat With Lucifer and Nuclear War. Since Nuclear War's contents overlapped with both Fireside Chat and Celestial Love, we have reconstituted the latter two as complete albums, thus covering all titles from these Variety dates.\nThe music on Celestial Love is mostly \"inside\" Ra, veering towards mainstream jazz (the lengthy and adventurous \"Fireside Chat,\" not on this album, being an exception). Ra's early hero, Duke Ellington, is represented twice with \"Sophisticated Lady\" and \"Drop Me Off in Harlem,\" and two other standards (\"Smile\" and \"Sometimes I'm Happy,\" both sung by June Tyson) are given snappy Ra arrangements.\nThe album contains the only known recordings of \"Celestial Love\" and \"Blue Intensity.\" \"Interstellarism\" is a reinvention of \"Interstellar Low Ways,\" a composition Ra first recorded in 1959 (with reed stalwarts John Gilmore and Marshall Allen, who are on this version 23 years later). \"Nameless One #2,\" a blues workout, is reprised on \"Nameless One #3.\" (\"Nameless One #1\" has apparently not been written, but could yet arrive from a distant galaxy.)\nThough Sun Ra was renowned for outrageous music and performances, Celestial Love is a reminder that he was a man of many moods, with a deep respect for jazz history. His embrace of Futurism never implied a rejection of the past. Even rocket ships were constructed with raw materials discovered eons ago.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Continuation, like a number of early Sun Ra albums, contains mysteries. Who's on it? When and where was it recorded? Expert opinions differ. The Robert Campbell-Christopher Trent discographic atlas, The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd edition, 2000), provides some guidance, but the citations contain numerous question marks. Personnel lists on Saturn LP covers have proven notoriously (perhaps willfully) inaccurate. In fact, the recording location printed on the Continuation sleeve is \"El Saturn Studios: Minneapolis, Minn.,\" yet no one has alleged any such sessions, much less the existence of a Sun Ra studio in Minnesota. The spelling of track two differs (\"Intergalaxtic Research\" on the LP and in The Earthly Recordings, but \"Intergalactic …\" appears in the BMI title registration).\nThe LP side-length \"Continuation to Jupiter Festival\" was reportedly recorded live at a club called The East, in Brooklyn, but there's no indication of an audience, including during quiet passages and after exciting solos; the constrained ambience of the track indicates a studio setting. Danny Ray Thompson, as reported by Campbell-Trent, \"has a recollection ('not 100 percent') of performing this piece at The East.\" Indeed it could have been performed—but perhaps not recorded—there. Robert Barry is credited as drummer, but the aggressive stickwork (as Campbell and Trent note) sounds like Clifford Jarvis.\nSeveral authorities believe studio tracks 1 thru 4 were recorded in 1968, but \"Biosphere Blues\" sounds as if it were recorded in the early 1960s at the Choreographer's Workshop. That location (and the year 1963) was cited on a limited-pressing Corbett vs. Dempsey CD of the album, linking it with early 1960s recordings which appeared on Secrets of the Sun and Art Forms of Dimensions Tomorrow. In 2014, Campbell-Trent offered a reconsideration: \"normally dated 1968-69, but on stylistic grounds an earlier date is likely for these tracks.\"\nThe personnel listed below contains a slew of maybes. Based on the knowns and probables, as well as the sounds and instrumentation, Continuation closely reflects Sun Ra's album Atlantis, which was recorded in September 1968. In fact the Gibson Kalamazoo (\"space\") organ and the Hohner clavinet on \"Intergalactic Research\" are also heard on Atlantis, and Sun Ra did not use either in the early 1960s (the Hohner wasn't introduced until 1964).\nThe version of \"New Planet\" on this remastered edition contains an extra minute and a half of music discovered on the master tape (a 14-second gap was deleted). The monumental \"Continuation to Jupiter Festival\" is 15 seconds shorter than the LP, possibly due to a slightly slower tape speed during the Saturn LP mastering. Finally, there is an album's worth of unreleased material from these sessions, which we have compiled and released as Continuation Vol. II.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Continuation 2 would surprise Sun Ra, because he never released any such album. Around 1970 he did release Continuation, a limited-pressing LP of recordings whose origins have confounded experts. The Robert Campbell-Christopher Trent discographic atlas, The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd edition, pub. 2000), provides some guidance on personnel, but the citations contain many question marks. Several authorities believe these sessions date from 1968 or '69, yet they echo recordings made in the early 1960s at the Choreographer's Workshop. That location (and the year 1963) was cited on a limited-pressing Corbett vs. Dempsey 2CD set of Continuation, linking it with early '60s recordings on Secrets of the Sun and Art Forms of Dimensions Tomorrow. In 2014, Campbell-Trent offered a reconsideration: \"normally dated 1968-69, but on stylistic grounds an earlier date is likely for these tracks.\"\nSun Ra Archives Executive Director Michael D. Anderson, who transferred these tracks from undated master tapes, insists they originate from '63 and were recorded at CW. That venue was a longtime Arkestra rehearsal space and ad hoc recording studio, a residency that began shortly after their 1961 arrival in NYC following the formative Chicago years.\nThe recordings on Continuation Vol. 2 (all in full stereo) feature small ensembles of between six and eight players, typical of CW recordings from the early '60s. At the time, Sun Ra was working largely with musicians who had come east with him, along with a handful of New York recruits. One of the few clues that argues against CW is the absence of the harsh warehouse acoustics characteristic of the Workshop basement. These recordings have a warmer studio feel, though they still reflect a low-rent setting.\nStylistically these works bridge the Chicago post-big band sound (the soulful ballad \"Blue York\" and the languid \"Ihnfinity\") with the bold, experimental direction of Sunny's 1960s NYC recordings (\"Meteor Shower\" and \"Conversation of the Universe\"). Perhaps a clue can be found in track 7, a medley of sorts entitled \"Cosmic Rays/The Next Stop Mars.\" The latter was first recorded in 1963 and released in 1966 on When Angels Speak of Love.\nThe now out-of-print package by Corbett vs. Dempsey packaged both albums under the title Continuation. Strangely the raw tape transfers were not digitally repaired by the label, resulting in such preserved (and unwanted) artifacts as volume disparities, audio dropouts and gaps, transient noises, and excessive hiss. Granted, on many Sun Ra albums those are features, not bugs; yet today's digital audio software can overcome—or at least minimize—many of the technical flaws of vintage recordings.\nFor this remastered edition, we have undertaken meticulous digital restoration to remove these flaws as much as possible. These recordings are not—and never will be—pristine. Recordings made 50 years ago, preserved on audio tape which was subjected to haphazard storage over the decades, cannot be perfected. However, when remastering Sun Ra recordings, such a goal is a fool's errand. In the process of trying to achieve perfection, we would likely remove layers of soul.\nWe have opted to separate the original LP contents from the unreleased material and package them as Continuation Volume 1 and Volume 2, each featuring the same cover with different color schemes. Both are available in our Bandcamp catalog.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Recorded in 1963 but not released until 1967 on Sun Ra's Saturn label, Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy is one of the more notorious of the artist's early New York releases. It near-completely rejects existing notions of jazz in favor of conducted chaos, offering a template for the unknown. Therapeutic for some, electroshock for others. In its lysergic abstractness, Cosmic Tones prefigures by a few years the outer dimensions of psychedelia (which was inspired by psychosis-replicating chemicals), and foreshadows some of the wilder studio escapades of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention. (Early in their careers—though a decade apart—Zappa and Sun Ra shared a producer: Tom Wilson.)\nThe album—or at least its title—may have originated when Sun Ra's manager Alton Abraham arranged a performance for patients at a Chicago psychiatric facility. Biographer John Szwed, in his definitive Ra bio Space Is the Place, describes the scene:\n\"The group of patients assembled for this early experiment in musical therapy included catatonics and severe schizophrenics, but Sunny approached the job like any other, making no concessions in his music. While he was playing, a woman who it was said had not moved or spoken for years got up from the floor, walked directly to his piano, and cried out, ‘Do you call that music?’ Sunny was delighted with her response and told the story for years afterwards as evidence of the healing powers of music.\"\nThe openers, \"And Otherness\" and \"Thither and Yon,\" were recorded at the Choreographer's Workshop (where the Arkestra regularly rehearsed from 1962 to 1964). \"Adventure Equation,\" \"Moon Dance,\" and \"Voice of Space\" were recorded at Brooklyn's Tip Top Club, reportedly at 10 a.m., an off-hours booking facilitated by drummer Tommy \"Bugs\" Hunter, who gigged there at night with Sarah McLawler's trio. The acoustics are ad hoc, and on \"Adventure Equation\" the club's phone can be heard ringing during two passages. The reverb overload on \"Thither and Yon\" and \"Voice of Space\" were the handiwork of Hunter, who jerryrigged cables on his Ampex 602 tape recorder and controlled the echo by adjusting the output volume.\nArkestra saxophonists John Gilmore and Marshall Allen are present, but playing bass clarinet and oboe respectively, while sax is covered by Pat Patrick and brash newcomer Danny Davis. Sunny plays Clavioline and percussion (as do others), but no piano. The Arkestra rarely plays in ensemble mode, but instead alternately deploys in smaller configurations, almost chamber-style.\nAlthough most of the album is a disjointed improvisational tapestry, \"Adventure Equation\" displays rhythmic cohesiveness, as does \"Moon Dance,\" a jaunty exercise in \"Latin voodoo\" with a groove that won't quit. The track features Sunny on the Tip-Top's Hammond B-3 organ.\nThe distorted saxophone passages on \"And Otherness\" exist in that condition on the master tape. These artifacts cannot be removed without altering the documented performance. However, on Cosmic Tones, this may be a feature, not a bug.\n\"Twilight,\" a previously unreleased recording that might have originated at the Tip-Top Club, is marred by significant noise, possibly from poor storage, tape degradation, or sub-par recording conditions. The track may have appeared on an obscure Saturn release or demo, as the surface noise sounds like a poor vinyl pressing or an acetate cutting. The instrumentation sounds like celeste, oboe, French horn, and percussion. Sunny had just two regular French horn players over the years, and Vincent Chancey wasn’t yet on the scene. That leaves Robert Northern as the only other possibility, which would date the track to late 1964 or early 1965.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "COSMOS contains the only studio recordings captured in summer 1976 during the fourth European tour of Sun Ra and His Arkestra. Live recordings are known to exist from concerts in Switzerland, Italy, and France.\nCosmos was issued in France in '76 on Cobra (identified as Blue Silver on the sleeve and label), in the US that same year on Inner City, in 1991 on Buda (France), and as a bootleg edition or two. Each time it resurfaced, the audio quality changed, sometimes for the better, sometimes not. On the 1991 CD, the bass was mixed at woofer-quaking levels; the Inner City LP sounds flat.\nIn 2015, tape librarian/engineer Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive began assembling a digital reissue. Tape could only be located for tracks 2, 3, and 4, and the various LP and CD configurations offered idiosyncratic production variants. Eventually, best quality recordings were extracted from a combination of sources: track 1 from the Inner City CD, and tracks 5, 6, and 7 from a near-mint Cobra LP. These were digitally remastered in several stages, to create an improvement over prior editions.\nThough the full Arkestra was resident in Paris for two months, the lineup on Cosmos is a stripped-down dozen, reportedly due to a cramped recording facility. Three tracks (\"Neo Project No. 2,\" \"Cosmos,\" and Journey Among the Stars\") exist on this album and nowhere else; \"Jazz from an Unknown Planet\" was performed on the '76 tour, but is an otherwise neglected work. \"Interstellar Low Ways,\" \"Moonship Journey,\" and \"The Mystery of Two\" re-enter the repertoire at unpredictable intervals.\nThe presence of the ROCKSICHORD—a slightly cheesy electronic harpsichord popular in the late 1960s with psychedelic bands and some avant-garde composers—links Cosmos with Ra's 1970 album NIGHT OF THE PURPLE MOON. Though six years apart, they are in some ways companion albums (and in some ways, not). Like Purple Moon, Cosmos features a more accessible side of Ra, a mix of relatively earthbound ensemble jazz and pan-galactic excursions. It's a more structured set than many offered by Ra during the decade, although it does not lack for adventure.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Jagged spears of crystal thrust into the brain (or is it the heart?) elicit an agonizing howl, a cry, and a scream. Thus opens Sun Ra’s 1973 adventure-mystery Crystal Spears. After a few minutes of a cathartic brawl between Minimoog and Yamaha combo organ, percussionists Atakatune and Odun enter while drummer Clifford Jarvis provides tonal textures, not rhythm, from the kit. Marshall Allen saunters in with a rather plaintive oboe, under which Ra later overdubbed (a rarity on an Arkestra recording!) a marimba. But this momentary gentleness is soon disrupted by roaring electronic keyboards over waves of rollicking marimba devilishly chattering below the fray.\nCrystal Spears, intended for release in 1975 by ABC/Impulse! and assigned catalog # AS-9297, was ultimately rejected by the label. Ra and business manager Alton Abraham retained the rights, rechristened the album Crystal Clear and assigned Saturn Records catalog # 562—but never got around to issuing it. The first three tracks on this album were mastered from that tape, a 1/4-inch four-track (15 IPS) brand favored by home recording enthusiasts—and generally disfavored by pro engineers. The sessions took place at Variety Recording Studio in New York on February 3, 1973, a month before the Ark returned on March 8 to record another Impulse-rejected album, Cymbals/Symbols (also available in a remastered edition from Modern Harmonic).\nWhy was Crystal Spears rejected? A year or two after Ra’s signing, reigning ABC management was swept out and new execs rolled in. It’s quite probable that the new execs didn’t comprehend what was happening on these recordings. For the uninitiated, this was not jazz as they knew it, but unbridled cacophony. But is it? Sun Ra always had a method to his madness—and a madness to his method.\nMost of the Ra projects on Impulse! were reissues of Saturn-label releases which had been poorly distributed (and pressed in limited quantities). In 1972-73, Ra reportedly produced eight newly recorded projects for Impulse!—two were released at the time, and five have been issued since 2000. Ra’s “guided improvisations” often showcased his extraterrestrial takes on the blues as well as “chamber jazz,” a classical/jazz hybrid popularized by 1950’s Hollywood composers such as Leith Stevens, Fred Katz, and Robert Markowitz for crime jazz. It’s a good bet that Ra was as fascinated by these cinematic sounds as he was with the Exotica of Les Baxter. (Fans of the latter should explore Modern Harmonic's double album of Sun Ra Exotica.)\nThe core of the Arkestra played together daily, enduring endless hours in rehearsal and more onstage; by 1973, some had played with Ra for over 15 years. This forged a musical telepathy that helped this music coalesce. Since the mid-1960’s, their group improvisations deployed deep layers that blossomed over repeated listening.\nTrack two, “The Eternal Sphynx,” is probably the most commercial sounding work. Stylistically related to the “Discipline” series of compositions Ra crafted in the early 1970’s, the ensemble plays a repetitive two-bar vamp, in which soloists Danny Davis (alto) and John Gilmore (tenor) and Ra (who slinks into “Space Is The Place”) commune. The band returns to the motif before building up to a Space Chord finale, upon which Ra overlays a minor/major-7th chord, that irrefutable “sound of intrigue” heard from Peter Gunn to 007.\nCinematic suspense permeates “The Embassy of the Living God,” who apparently resides in a haunted mansion. There’s an eerie majesty to Ra’s chordal voicings. Eloe Omoe’s bass clarinet and Marshall Allen’s oboe add an otherworldliness with their howlings, until the entire group retreats into the shadows as Gilmore’s hellacious wails materialize. Ra’s starburst organ runs and (probably) Kwame Hadi’s trumpet herald the propulsive finish of the track, which ends sharply and conclusively.\n“Sunrise In The Western Sky” opens with various gongs, some overdubbed, announcing the rising of the sun in the east. This is a more languid composition, reflecting its title. By its denouement, the sun is out in full force, its fury scorching the planet. The drums soon abate, their work for the day done. But will the need for sunset bring them back to evoke the gods again? In Sun Ra’s aural cinematheque, one has to await the sequel that may never arrive to learn the answers one may never know.\n– Brother Cleve",

            "about": "Recorded at the Squat Theatre, NYC, 1980, and released on Sun Ra's Saturn record label in 1981. All four titles are unique to this album and do not recur in Ra's performance chronicles or recording discography.\nSquat was founded in Budapest by Hungarian dissidents in the 1960s. In the 1970s a number of Squat founders were expelled from Hungary, and these political exiles relocated to New York, where they re-established the theater in a cramped storefront at 256 West 23rd Street. Besides music, Squat was known for dramatic productions (from Chekhov to conceptual absurdism), which were staged in the theater's window overlooking the 23rd Street sidewalk.\nFrom 1979 to 1982 the Arkestra gigged regularly at Squat; an unknown number of performances were recorded, a few released commercially in limited quantities with handmade covers. The Squat archives (at  SquatTheatre.com)  claim that Ra debuted there in August 1979 and performed on the premises 47 times, \"to become our most frequent guest.\" The chronicle explains that \"the fit between the Arkestra and the Squat Theatre was a natural one, as both were in essence creative communes.\"",

            "about": "Discipline 27-II was recorded in 1972, a product of the same sessions that would yield Sun Ra's legendary Space Is the Place LP. The recordings took place October 19–20 at Streeterville Studios, Chicago, featuring the largest Arkestra line-up Ra had taken into a studio. The date was produced by Impulse! and Riverside veteran Ed Michel.\nThere have been several atrocious-sounding bootleg editions on the market, but this 2017 fully authorized remaster reveals the rich clarity of these sessions. This edition was remastered for Strut Records by Peter Beckmann from the original master tapes in the Sun Ra Music Archive, under license from Sun Ra LLC.\nOn the original 1972 Saturn version released by Sun Ra, the 24-minute title track was inexplicably divided into four separate tracks at arbitrary points, thus interrupting the flow of the work. On this remastered edition, the title track has been restored to its proper length without interruption.\nThe LP version, released by Strut for Record Store Day 2017, features complete original artwork, full roster of players on each track, and new sleeve notes by Francis Gooding.\nA CD edition was issued in October 2017 by Corbett vs. Dempsey Records.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "Discipline 99, a.k.a. Out Beyond the Kingdom Of, was recorded at a Hunter College, New York, performance by Sun Ra & His Arkestra on June 16, 1974. Selected titles were issued that year on LP (Saturn 61674); the album went thru several pressings with different-colored labels, at least as late as 1980. As with many privately pressed Saturns from the 1970s and '80s, the total press run is unknown, but presumably it totals in the hundreds, not the thousands, hence original copies are rare.\nSome copies of D99 featured a generic \"Acropolis\" cover, others were hand-decorated or sported paste-on art. The cover of this digital edition, scanned from an LP sleeve in the collection of Gilbert Hsiao, features one of the best illustrations we've seen of ANY Saturn DIY release. (The artist is unknown; this illustration graced the sleeves of other Saturn releases from the period, but this particular cover had \"Discipline 99\" handwritten in the upper left.)\nFacts and a bit of speculation about this date were chronicled in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent. At the time of the first edition of ER, a 95-minute audience tape had been identified that included most of the first set, and part of the second set (the end of the set, it turned out); by the time the book was updated in 2000, a second audience tape (recorded by a different attendee) had been located, containing 105 minutes of concert audio. From these two tapes, Campbell and Trent were able to assemble two likely (but not conclusive) set lists for the concert, including titles which were omitted from the Saturn release.\n“Solar Ship,\" which RLC/CT believe opened the second set, includes an unidentified emcee announcing the band as \"Brother Sun Ra and the Space Orchestra.\" However, this intro is not on either tape; it appears only on the Saturn LP, unfathomably sequenced as track 4, the final track on side A. For this digital edition, \"Solar Ship\" opens the album, where an emcee's introduction belongs. Is it possible this intro originated at a different concert? With Ra's penchant for intrigue, anything is possible.\nFrom ER: \"The second, longer tape indicates that 'Cosmos Synthesis' was edited on the Saturn release. Both tapes reveal that 'Keep Your Sunny Side Up' was faded [on the LP] at the end of John Gilmore’s solo (solos by Kwame Hadi, Pat Patrick, Ra on piano, and Ronnie Boykins, plus the final ensemble, were cut, probably because Hadi was off-mic during his solo). [We] identified the baritone sax soloist on this number as Charles Davis, but the electric bass line on 'Angels and Demons' would indicate Pat Patrick. A long bowed bass solo on 'Discipline 27' is the work of Ronnie Boykins, and Danny Thompson can be heard on the Neptunian libflecto during 'The Shadow World.' A second [unknown] trap drummer is audible on 'Angels and Demons.'\" [These latter titles were not included on the album.]\n\"Discipline 99\" (the track) starts as a recurring \"Discipline\" dirge (a cryptically numbered series of Ra compositions), but after a few minutes of ensemble play it segues into a lovely and unpredictable 7-minute solo piano odyssey. In this era—mid-1970s—Ra more commonly performed and recorded with an arsenal of electronic keyboards. He never abandoned the piano, and during this period tracks featuring piano were scattered throughout many recording projects (live and studio). But it wasn't until 1977 when Ra recorded two solo albums for Paul Bley's Improvising Artists label that he gravitated back to acoustic piano for full sessions. His piano chops were showcased on such late-'70s releases as Some Blues But Not the Kind That's Blue (1977), God Is More Than Love Can Ever Be (1979), Omniverse (1979), and a 1977 solo concert in Venice, Italy, that was recorded and posthumously released. While no statement from the artist exists for this career arc, it's well-known among Ra scholars that after he moved to Philadelphia in the late 1960s, Ra no longer had an acoustic piano in his living quarters-cum-rehearsal space.\nThe standard \"How Am I To Know\" (lyrics by Dorothy Parker) opens with an extended solo piano passage, after which Gilmore enters with a soulful tenor serenade. With drums and bass barely audible due to ad hoc mic placement, the recording essentially qualifies as a duet.\n\"Out Beyond the Kingdom Of\" is also based on the Discipline template, with June Tyson repeating for emphasis Ra's declamations about the world having ended 3,000 years ago. The second (after Ra) declarative male voice on \"Outer Space Employment Agency\" and \"Journey to Saturn\" belongs to horn player Akh Tal Ebah, with responses by a vibrant June Tyson (who regrettably is not well-miked on these recordings).\nThe overall audio quality is so-so, but for Sun Ra, sonic deficiencies were always secondary to artistic intent. A close listening will reveal some very artful performances on Discipline 99, especially by Ra and Gilmore.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "Every Sun Ra album is unique. Yet even by Ra's standards, DISCO 3000 is an outlier. However, it sits comfortably in the Sun Ra discography — because it's weird.\nIn 1978, capital-D Disco was at its apex — the pop dance music du jour, the bottom-heavy successor to rock'n'roll and funk. Ra was never a dedicated follower of fashion (music or otherwise), yet that year his landmark album LANQUIDITY would not have been unwelcome in a mirror ball-dappled club. LANQUIDITY was one of Ra's few nods to contemporary musical currents—and it remains one of his most revered projects.\nThat same year his Saturn label issued DISCO 3000. Referencing the term \"Disco\" was typical, willful, sardonic Ra \"misdirection.\" The \"3000\" might be forecasting a future millennium when humans — or cyborgs — dance to this music. If so, it's a shame we won’t be around to see if these grooves electrify partygoers. By 1978 standards, the album was anything but Disco. It was weird. It was Sun Ra.\nRa spent part of winter 1977-78 in Italy on a musical odyssey. He may have made two trips, or one extended stay — accounts vary. But his creative activity in a short span was prodigious: a piano recital recorded in Venice, in November 1977; two double-LP studio albums (OTHER VOICES/OTHER BLUES, and NEW STEPS), recorded for the Horo label, in January 1978; and two and a half live albums, recorded in early January, issued on his own Saturn imprint: DISCO 3000, MEDIA DREAMS, and side B of SOUND MIRROR.\nWriting in his 1998 Sun Ra bio, SPACE IS THE PLACE—before any of the above Saturn albums had been reissued in any format (original 1978 pressings probably numbered in the low hundreds)—John Szwed wrote, \"Sonny took a quartet to Italy in early 1978 …, and despite his misgivings about small bands, they produced some concert and studio recordings which are some of the most interesting and little known of the Sun Ra output.\" These projects offer a unique—never before, never after—opportunity to hear Sun Ra's music performed live by a quartet, rather than solo or with some iteration of the legendary Arkestra. The unconventional four-man interplay from one January night in Milan's Teatro Ciak is preserved on DISCO 3000.\nAccompanying Ra in Italy were mainstay tenor saxophonist John Gilmore; trumpeter Michael Ray, a relative newcomer, who had first played with Ra only a few months prior; and another recent recruit, drummer Luqman Ali (Edward Skinner), who had joined the Arkestra in early 1977. Ra played grand piano and the idiosyncratic (and short-lived) electronic console, the Crumar Mainman. Gilmore also took a turn on drums, and everybody sang (though most of the Italy recordings are instrumental). Rodger Coleman, at Sun Ra Sundays, described DISCO 3000 as a \"mad-scientist keyboard extravaganza, with the Crumar Mainman organ and cheesy rhythm box establishing an uneasy, mutant disco vamp.\" There's also lots of sweeping piano, inspired, torching horn solos — and no bass. There was no bass on any of the Italian dates—although the Crumar purportedly had a bass feature, which served Ra's purposes.\nInvented in 1977 by the Italian company Crumar (the name is a portmanteau of founders Mario Crucianelli and F. Marchetti), the device was an early polyphonic synth, capable of a variety of sounds and effects, including programmable percussion. Ra's model was reportedly one of less than a dozen prototypes; the product was eventually scrapped and never marketed. Musician and keyboard historian (and Ra scholar) Brother Cleve says, \"It was pretty much a glorified string ensemble that included brass, bass, and percussion options. You could also add fuzz tones, and use the volume pedal for a number of effects.\" The Mainman could also replicate a piano, but Ra had access to acoustic pianos on all Italy dates.\nMichael Ray, writing in 2007, explained that in late 1978, he \"got a phone call from Sun Ra [in] Rome. He asked if I was able to come to record an album. I jumped at the chance! Luckily I already had a passport from my travels with the singing pop group, the Stylistics. I headed to Rome, not knowing what to expect, but knowing I was in good hands with Sunny, John Gilmore and Luqman Ali.\" Every day Ra would rise at dawn, and the quartet would drive over to a small studio called Media Dreams to practice. \"It was here,\" said Ray, \"that most of my early dues were paid. Sun Ra would tell me 'You playing your horn alright, but try my way, unless you have some sort of mental block.' And, 'Play that apple. Remember, it's round, so think of 360 degrees of sound and color. It's red, which means its energy deals with the first chakra. You have to be able to play the 'vibration.' We rehearsed like this from early morning to late night for days.\" The repertoire consisted of new works, with improvised passages, as well as such Ra perennials as \"Spontaneous Simplicity,\" \"We Travel the Spaceways,\" \"Images,\" and \"Friendly Galaxy.\"\nThe original 1978 Saturn LP of DISCO 3000 featured only four works—the 26-minute title track on side A, and \"Third Planet,\" \"Friendly Galaxy,\" and \"Dance of the Cosmo-Aliens\" on side B, in that sequence. That album was reissued on vinyl by Peter Dennett of Art Yard Records in 2005.\nHowever, Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive had tape of the full concert, which was provided to Dennett in 2007 for an expanded release. Art Yard replicated the sequence of the original concert, during which \"Third Planet,\" which preceded \"Friendly Galaxy\" on the original Saturn LP, actually followed the latter in the set list—and they were performed as an extended medley. To retain the concert sequence across two compact discs, Art Yard had to cleave the full track so that the first half (\"Friendly Galaxy\") closed disc one (with a fadeout), and the second half (\"Third Planet\") opened disc two (with a fade-in—and a brief reprise of \"Friendly Galaxy\" at the end).\nWhen Art Yard's license expired after 2020, the rights reverted to Sun Ra LLC, and this digital release is the current iteration of the set. There are differences.\nThe \"Friendly Galaxy/Third Planet\" medley is here presented for the first time as a complete performance.\nSome minor adjustments and refinements have been made to the recordings in spots, and some audience applause has been trimmed. One bonus track has been added. That tune, \"Jazzisticology,\" recorded on the same Italian expedition, was originally issued on the 1978 Saturn album SOUND MIRROR, along with one other track from the trip, \"Of Other Tomorrows Never Known.\" Art Yard included the latter work on their expanded release of MEDIA DREAMS, and it will be included on our forthcoming digital edition of that album. (The title track of SOUND MIRROR originated from an unrelated New York or Philadelphia studio session.)\nHaving conquered Italy, less than a week after this frenetic intercontinental expedition, Ra was back performing in the U.S.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "SUNNY MEETS SALAH\nDrummer/composer/bandleader Salah Ragab (ca. 1936–2008) was a pivotal figure in Middle Eastern jazz. He is considered by many authorities to be the founder of Egyptian jazz, having formed his first ensembles in the 1960s. Sun Ra's friendship and musical interplay with Ragab began in 1971 on the Arkestra's first visit to Egypt. (See remembrance by Hartmut Geerken below.) Ra issued a number of albums from recordings made on that tour, including Live in Egypt Volume I (a.k.a. Dark Myth Equation Visitation, a.k.a. Nature's God); Nidhamu (a.k.a. Live in Egypt Vol. II); and Horizon (a.k.a. Starwatchers, a.k.a. Live in Egypt Vol. III).\nRagab composed \"Egypt Strut\" and \"Dawn\" and accompanied the Arkestra on congas for this May 1983 studio session, which was recorded at El Nahar Studio, Heliopolis, Cairo, on Sun Ra's second tour of Egypt. These two stellar tracks were issued that year by the Greece-based Praxis label on a hybrid album that coupled these two Ra-Ragab collaborations with three early 1970s recordings by Ragab (without Sun Ra) leading the Cairo Jazz Band and an unnamed quintet.\nThe five Praxis tracks were later reissued by the UK-based Leo label in 1999. The '99 package added two tracks: a 1971 recording of \"Music for Angela Davis\" (comp. Hartmut Geerken) by the Cairo Free Jazz Ensemble (conducted by Geerken), and a third Ra-Ragab track: a live-in-Cairo 1984 version of \"Watusa,\" a decades-old staple in Sunny's repertoire. A freewheeling 18-minute tour-de-force, this \"Watusa\" nonetheless constitutes one of the worst audio captures of a Sun Ra performance ever commercially issued (Transparency-grade atrocious). You had to be there. It is not here.\nTHE DIGITAL EP\nDue to the somewhat mismatched programming of the Praxis and Leo albums, as well as their limited circulation, \"Egypt Strut\" and \"Dawn\" may have been overlooked by many Ra fans. We've coupled them here into an essential digital EP so these tracks can receive the focus they deserve. \"Egypt Strut\" might fittingly be subtitled \"Egyptian Sidewinder,\" as certain passages echo Lee Morgan's 1964 classic, with a Middle Eastern flavor. \"Dawn\" is a perfect crossover collaboration that highlights how Ra's and Ragab's styles overlap and where they diverge.\nArt Yard Records proprietor Peter Dennett, who has been toiling for years to preserve Salah Ragab's artistic legacy, issued a superb set of 1968–1973 recordings by Ragab and the Cairo Jazz Band. It is available on Bandcamp at:  salahragab.bandcamp.com/album/egyptian-jazz.\nHARTMUT GEERKEN RECALLS:\n\"In June 1971, I sent an invitation to Sun Ra from Cairo and six months later the Arkestra came to the land of the pharaohs to play at the foot of the pyramids. When they played in my living room in Heliopolis on December 12, 1971, Salah Ragab was one of my guests. It was their first personal contact.\n\"Sun Ra set out again 12 years later to gaze into the eyes of Sphinx. In May 1983 he went into El Nahar Studio in Heliopolis with Salah Ragab to record two Ragab compositions. To my knowledge it had never happened before that Sun Ra and his Arkestra played compositions of a contemporary musician from outside [the band]. Maybe he was taken with the initials of Salah Ragab-which were the same as his own-or he was fascinated with the fact that his own name was part of Ragab's. To my knowledge, Salah was the only non Afro-American, apart from Leah Ananda from Kashmir and Roger Aralamon Hazoumè from Dahomey, to be documented on record with Sun Ra.\n\"In 1984 Sun Ra came to Egypt for the third time. For this last visit Salah played drums in the Arkestra when the band played at the small Jazz club Il Capo in Zamalek.\"\nHISTORICAL FOOTNOTE\nFrom The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, 2nd edition, 2000):\n\"According to Hartmut Geerken, the entire [1971 Sun Ra and his Astro Intergalactic Infinity Arkestra in Cairo] concert (3-1/2 hours) was taped by [Arkestra drummer/engineer] Tommy Hunter; it is not known whether additional material survives. All of the band's instruments (except Ra's synthesizer) had been impounded by Egyptian customs and consequently instruments had to be borrowed from the Egyptian Army (courtesy of Salah Ragab). The Tiger organ was obtained locally as a substitute for Ra's Farfisa or Spacemaster. Clifford Jarvis used Geerken's elaborate percussion set during the concert.\"",

            "about": "Despite the fact that Sun Ra has over 1,000 titles copyrighted in his name, a good part of his concert and recorded repertoire consisted of works by other composers. He arranged—in his idiosyncratic way— tunes by Monk, Gershwin, Henderson (Fletcher and Horace), Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and countless others. But no one breezed into Sun Ra set lists more often than the \"Duke\"—Edward Kennedy Ellington.\nGrowing up in Birmingham, Alabama, Herman Poole \"Sonny\" Blount (born 1914) came of age in the 1930s, when big band \"Swing\" jazz was in vogue. When he later formed his Arkestra, Sonny drew on this legacy, though he re-shaped the big band format into something his own—a singular (afro-)futuristic reinvention that somehow echoed the music of his youth. Ra as an artist looked forward and backward. He relished innovation, but revered tradition. Paradoxically, the older he got—by the 1970s and '80s—the more Swing Era chestnuts he revived in his work. Despite the fact that many of his admired composers matured to create more advanced works after the 1930s—Ellington a perfect case in point—Ra’s taste remained rooted in the '30s. Of the 12 titles on this collection, all but two date from that decade—\"East St. Louis Toodle-oo\" is even earlier (1926), and \"Duke’s Place\" dates from 1942.\nJohn Szwed, writing in the biography, SPACE IS THE PLACE: THE LIVES AND TIMES OF SUN RA, offers an interesting Ellingtonian vignette. In his twenties, Sonny was listening to, studying, transcribing, and performing contemporary big band jazz with a passion. Yet, writes Szwed, \"Swing music was by now easy for him, formulaic and predictable. But he had another book of arrangements which [his] band rehearsed but never performed and whose purpose he never explained. … The compositions and arrangements in this book were inspired by dreams or made up of ideas derived from reading 'Popular Mechanics,' pieces … built on complex and oddly shifting rhythm patterns.\"\nSzwed continues: \"When Duke Ellington was in town, Sonny took his book of arrangements backstage to show him. They talked for over an hour, Ellington gracious and regal in his black silk dressing gown. At one point the Duke pulled out his own arrangements. Sonny saw that Ellington also used dissonance in his writing, only it never seemed dissonant. Sonny was thrilled to see his own ideas confirmed.\"\nThis collection of Ellingtonia features mostly previously unreleased material from two sources: the Sun Ra Music Archive, maintained by Michael D. Anderson, and the Experimental Sound Studio (ESS), Chicago. As with any Sun Ra compilation, audio fidelity varies from the sublime to the near-ridiculous. However, as any Ra fan will attest, the fidelity is usually secondary to the excitement of the performance. The collection opens with an early (1951)—and only recently discovered—intimate Ra duet with Wilbur Ware, recorded at Ra's Chicago apartment. From there things get raucous and reckless with concert recordings and two home-taped jams featuring Ra and a small ensemble of Arkestrans messing around with \"Caravan\" and \"It Don't Mean a Thing\"; the year and location of the latter session are unknown. There's more where that came from.\nFinally, make of this what you will: Duke Ellington, born in 1899, passed away in 1974. Not a single Ellington title performed by Ra appears in the exhaustive discography The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, before 1975. That book, published in 2000, covered all known (at the time) studio and live recordings by Ra (with or without the Arkestra). In '75, \"Lightnin'\" and \"Sophisticated Lady\" entered the repertoire, joined by \"Take the 'A' Train\" and \"Slippery Horn\" a year later. Other Ellington titles were added by Ra and encored throughout the 1980s. It is within the realm of fair speculation that after Duke's death, Ra embarked on a mission to preserve not just Ellington's legacy, but the legacies of a number of his musical heroes of the 1930s. Large traveling jazz orchestras had gone out of fashion by the 1950s. Sun Ra was one of the few who sustained—and advanced—the format for decades to come. After Ellington's passing, Sun Ra apparently saw the need to return frequently to the source.\n—I.C.",

            "about": "Here's a second volume of Sun Ra paying tribute to one of his favorite musical geniuses. And here's roughly the same annotation adapted from volume one, revised where appropriate.\nDespite the fact that Sun Ra has over 1,000 titles copyrighted in his name, a good part of his concert and recorded repertoire consisted of works by other composers. He arranged—in his idiosyncratic way— tunes by Monk, Gershwin, Henderson (Fletcher and Horace), Jerome Kern, Irving Berlin, and countless others. But no one breezed into Sun Ra set lists more often than the \"Duke\"—Edward Kennedy Ellington.\nGrowing up in Birmingham, Alabama, Herman Poole \"Sonny\" Blount (born 1914) came of age in the 1930s, when big band \"Swing\" jazz was in vogue. When he later formed his Arkestra, Sonny drew on this legacy, though he re-shaped the big band format into something his own—a singular (afro-)futuristic reinvention that somehow echoed the music of his youth. Ra as an artist looked forward and backward. He relished innovation, but revered tradition. Paradoxically, the older he got—by the 1970s and '80s—the more Swing Era chestnuts he revived in his work. Despite the fact that many of his admired composers matured to create more advanced works after the 1930s—Ellington a perfect case in point—Ra’s taste remained rooted in the '30s. Of the ten titles on this collection, all but one date from 1932 to 1941. (The outlier is \"Satin Doll,\" which debuted in 1953.)\nJohn Szwed, writing in the biography, SPACE IS THE PLACE: THE LIVES AND TIMES OF SUN RA, offers an interesting Ellingtonian vignette. In his twenties, Sonny was listening to, studying, transcribing, and performing contemporary big band jazz with a passion. Yet, writes Szwed, \"Swing music was by now easy for him, formulaic and predictable. But he had another book of arrangements which [his] band rehearsed but never performed and whose purpose he never explained. … The compositions and arrangements in this book were inspired by dreams or made up of ideas derived from reading 'Popular Mechanics,' pieces … built on complex and oddly shifting rhythm patterns.\"\nSzwed continues: \"When Duke Ellington was in town, Sonny took his book of arrangements backstage to show him. They talked for over an hour, Ellington gracious and regal in his black silk dressing gown. At one point the Duke pulled out his own arrangements. Sonny saw that Ellington also used dissonance in his writing, only it never seemed dissonant. Sonny was thrilled to see his own ideas confirmed.\"\nThis encore collection of Ellingtonia features material both previously released and unreleased. Some tracks originated with the Sun Ra Music Archive, maintained by Michael D. Anderson; others came from the Experimental Sound Studio (ESS), Chicago. A handful were derived from sources licit and illicit. As with any Sun Ra compilation, audio fidelity varies from the sublime to the near-ridiculous. However, as any Ra fan will attest, the fidelity is secondary to the excitement of the performance.\nThe collection opens with a lo-fi 1950s-era version of \"Flamingo,\" on which Ra plays piano and Solovox simultaneously, with some percussion buried beneath the clatter. This short take segues into a magnificent 1978 studio recording of the same title with the full Arkestra. (This version originally appeared on the Sweet Earth LP The Other Side of the Sun.) Two tracks, \"Perdido\" and \"Satin Doll,\" were apparently (rather well-)recorded by a ticketholder at a Bottom Line Arkestral tribute to the Duke in 1987. Extracted from a bootleg, these tracks have been sonically upgraded a tad. Two tracks were cheaply recorded in Chicago — \"Caravan,\" from 1958, captured at the Pershing Ballroom, and \"Sophisticated Lady,\" recorded at home in a 1951 duet with bassist Wilbur Ware. Three tracks were recorded live in Europe in the 1980s, and \"In a Sentimental Mood\" originated at a very informal home rehearsal, likely in the 1970s.\nFinally, make of this what you will: Duke Ellington, born in 1899, passed away in 1974. Not a single Ellington title performed by Ra appears in the exhaustive discography The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, before 1975. That book, published in 2000, covered all known (at the time) studio and live recordings by Ra (with or without the Arkestra). In '75, \"Lightnin'\" and \"Sophisticated Lady\" entered the repertoire, joined by \"Take the 'A' Train\" and \"Slippery Horn\" a year later. Other Ellington titles were added by Ra and encored throughout the 1980s. It is within the realm of fair speculation that after Duke's death, Ra embarked on a mission to preserve not just Ellington's legacy, but the legacies of a number of his musical heroes of the 1930s. Large traveling jazz orchestras had gone out of fashion by the 1950s. Sun Ra was one of the few who sustained—and advanced—the format for decades to come. After Ellington's passing, Sun Ra apparently saw the need to return frequently to the source.\n—I.C.",

            "about": "Fate in a Pleasant Mood was recorded in Chicago in 1960, but not released until 1965. It was the last album featuring Sunny's band from Chicago. After a decade and a half in the Windy City, tired of local indifference by fans and the press, Sun Ra decided to take his music elsewhere—briefly to Montreal, then New York, where he settled for seven years.\nStylistically, Fate in a Pleasant Mood veers from ballads to bebop, from free jazz to Ellington-inflected voicings, from the 12-bar blues to strains of crime jazz and cha-cha. In his Sun Ra biography Space is the Place, John Szwed says of the album's offerings: \"To a seasoned jazz listener at the time they might seem either slightly out of kilter or evidence of a band with a hidden agenda.\" Suspicions aside, Fate in a Pleasant Mood is an accessible album by the era's standards, and full of delights. Of particular note is the imaginative drum solo (probably by Jon Hardy) on \"Space Mates\"—a restrained touch at odds with the prevailing hard bop emphasis on funkiness and speed. Indeed, there are a lot of unusual percussion textures throughout the set (e.g. on \"Kingdom of Thunder,\" which approximates a Saturnesque take on the late '50s exotica of Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman).\nSun Ra discographer Robert L. Campbell wrote: \"In 1967 the album was given the catalog number 202. The spine of the Saturn LP, but not the front or back cover, rendered its title as it may have been intended originally, 'Faith in a Pleasant Mood' (the spine also said \"Saturn Vol. 2,\" without indicating what Volume 1 was, and gave the number as 9956-2-B).\"\nThis digital collection includes the unreleased 45 rpm single version of \"Lights on a Satellite,\" which features the engineer's title cue at the head followed by the album performance drenched in heavy reverb.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "REMASTERED 2018 EDITION\nCosmic Myth Records CMR 003\n24-bit audio\nGod Is More Than Love Can Ever Be is something of a rarity in the Sun Ra catalog—a cohesive album, with none of the stylistic eclecticism and musical chair shifting found on many of the artist’s self-released LPs. Recorded at Variety Studios one day in 1979, the album's five tracks comprise a solid jazz trio set.\nIt's also unusual because it had not previously been reissued. In March 2018 Cosmic Myth Records issued a newly remastered edition in LP, CD and digital formats. The LP and CD packages contain liner notes by jazz historian Marc Medwin and Sun Ra catalog administrator Irwin Chusid (who produced the reissue), as well as two previously unpublished photos of Sun Ra by jazz portraitist Veryl Oakland.\nGod is More Than Love is the only complete piano-bass-drums studio session in the massive Sun Ra catalog. What would have drawn the bandleader, 25 years into his recording career, to adopt a format that had been common in jazz for decades? Drummer Samarai Celestial (Eric Walker) recalled it being his first recording date with Ra; they were joined by bassist Hayes Burnett, who gigged with Ra on and off for a decade.\nThe album offers an intense set of cosmic vagabond moods, reflecting the telepathy that is the essence of small combo jazz. Sun Ra doesn't play notes—he paints stars. Burnett's bass runs fluid and thick. Celestial is a perpetual motion machine; his quicksilver fills echo the muscle and propulsion of a young Billy Cobham. This is a power machine, full of drive and liftoff, with sporadic (and surprising) gearshifts. Celestial's restless stickwork doesn't play the groove so much as imply it; Burnett's foundational pulse is the unifier. The threesome rarely locks in, but their musical spirits are intertwined.\nOther than an overdubbed second piano on \"Days of Happiness,\" the five works were spontaneously generated and forever fixed: none of the titles recur in the encyclopedic Ra discography. Originally released on Ra's private Saturn label in small press runs (under the alternate title Days of Happiness) from 1979 to 1981, fully realized artwork was never established and the album got scant circulation; hence, it has remained a largely overlooked session in the Ra omniverse. Nearly 40 years later, the record is long overdue for acclaim.\nCOSMIC MYTH RECORDS is is a partnership of Chusid, Michael D. Anderson (of the Sun Ra Music Archive) and Virtual Label Group, working under license from Sun Ra LLC, comprised of the heirs and rightsholders of Sun Ra's music. The label's first release in 2017 was a full stereo, remastered edition of Ra's 1965 magnum opus THE MAGIC CITY, with liner notes by Christopher Trent and Ben Young. It was followed by an expanded 2-LP edition of MY BROTHER THE WIND, Vol. 1, Ra's 1969 Moog synthesizer tour-de-force, remastered from session tapes, with rare and previously unreleased tracks and liner notes by Ben Young and Moog historian Brian Kehew.\nIn February 2019, CMR issued a three-volume set of MONORAILS AND SATELLITES, consisting of solo piano works by Ra recorded in 1966, including one volume of previously unissued material and liner notes by pianist Vijay Iyer, three-time Down Beat Jazz Artist of the Year.",

            "about": "[NOTE: This album, issued by us digitally in 2019, was remastered in 2022 for release on LP and CD by Modern Harmonic. Two bonus tracks were added—\"We Live To Be\" and \"Take the 'A' Train,\" both featuring Sun Ra on solo piano, both from unknown concerts. We have included on this Bandcamp-only digital version Walt Dickerson's solo vibraphone performance from the Haverford date, as well as a Dickerson-Ra duet encore from Haverford. What follows below are the liner notes from our 2019 digital release.]\nThis Sun Ra 1980 solo set has been kicking around the internet and in the digital libraries of Ra collectors for years. It has not previously been commercially released, nor has there been any (known) diligent attempt to upgrade the fidelity. We've taken action on both counts.\nThis is a very unique performance. Sun Ra is notorious for his aggressive keyboard attack and seemingly schizophrenic stylings—which can musically go from A to Z and back to A without transitional bridges. This set offers a marked contrast. Ra's instrument of choice here is the celeste-like Fender Rhodes electric piano, which has a distinct sound (instantly recognizable in the Doors' \"Riders on the Storm\") and an interesting history. There are few pyrotechnics in this performance, and much restraint. Ra sounds relaxed and contemplative. It's Soothing Sounds for Saturnians.\nThe meditative concert covers Ra's customary approach to solo outings: 1) original Ra crowd pleasers (Space is the Place, Love in Outer Space); 2) standards (St. Louis Blues, Rhapsody in Blue, Over the Rainbow); and 3) untitled improvisations (here assigned the titles \"Haverford Impromptu\" numbers one and two).\nThe lovely recurring melody of \"Haverford Impromptu #1\" sounds familiar—and sounds composed—but we could not conclusively identify it. We asked Ra discographer Christopher Trent if he could ID the work, and he observed: \"That’s a composition, not improvised. I don’t think it’s been released in any form. Ra would invent new tunes at his keyboard, and sometimes develop them into finished pieces for the Arkestra. Other works never became thoroughly developed, and being prone to spontaneity, Ra might perform them at unexpected moments. There’s footage of him rehearsing like this in the film 'A Joyful Noise.' There are quite a few keyboard compositions which he recorded only once, and which—like this—do not sound improvised. 'Monorails and Satellites' and 'The Adventures of Bugs Hunter' come to mind.\"\nDespite the \"Fender Rhodes\" name, the keyboard was not invented by Fender. It was developed in the 1940s by Harold Rhodes, who licensed the product to Fender in 1959. Fender modified the design, added their trademark name, and undertook the marketing campaign that made this piano iconic, particularly during the 1970s. Fender produced 73- and 88-key models.\nAlthough considered an \"electric piano,\" the Rhodes is actually an acoustic instrument with amplification. Unlike many \"electronic\" keyboards, the Rhodes has no digital components; it has internal hardware (metal tines, in place of conventional strings) that can produce sounds even when the device is turned off. Electrical current activates pickups which amplify the hammer action. The resultant sound is less resonant than a piano, and more of a bell-like chime.\nThe 1969 Fender Rhodes was sold with an attached “suitcase” stereo amplifier (on which the keyboard sat) designed to create unique panning and reverb effects. Esquivel loved this instrument and featured it on his final two RCA Victor albums. Several classic late 1960s/early 1970s Miles Davis albums are awash in Rhodes, played by Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, and Joe Zawinul. The amp-less Stage Model (1970) could be used with any external amplifier, and was often paired with the Fender Twin (or Quad!) Reverb guitar amp.\nIn 1975 Fender removed their name from the device for marketing reasons, but continued to manufacture modified models.\nThe stereo recording of the Haverford show which has been in circulation among collectors was slightly (and unpredictably) out of phase; these issues have largely been rectified. Non-performance artifacts and audience applause have been minimized. Someone with a bad cough punctuated a number of passages; we have gone to meticulous lengths to suppress his intrusive hacking.\nRa's old friend (and sometimes collaborator) Walt Dickerson was on the bill, performing a 25-minute solo vibraphone improvisation. That track has been digitally refined and is available ONLY on the Bandcamp edition of Haverford 1980. We did not remove the coughing (and sneezing) from the audience, whose health had apparently worsened between sets. It was January—flu season.\n—I.C.\n1/3/20: Reviewed by Hank Shteamer at RollingStone.com:\nbit.ly/36pT2eQ\n\"There’s an offhanded charm to the set that gradually draws you in, almost as though you’re listening to one of the 20th century’s greatest musical minds play stream-of-consciousness cocktail piano, casually joining up beloved standards with heady, extraterrestrially inspired originals.\"",

            "about": "Sun Ra was never reticent about honoring his musical heroes. These icons included Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk, Mary Lou Williams, George Gershwin, Fats Waller, songwriters such as Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer, and Irving Berlin, even Walt Disney, whose film music Ra performed jubilantly and often. But no one meant as much to Ra as Fletcher Henderson (1897–1952). With the exception of Ellington, no bandleader's repertoire was honored more in Ra's set lists than the man who invented the jazz big band.\nHowever, Ra's respect for Henderson was not from an historical distance. He worked with Henderson in Chicago in the late 1940s, during the twilight of the great conductor's career. Sonny served as the band's pianist and arranger.\nHenderson never achieved the public acclaim (and financial rewards) bestowed on such legends as Ellington, Louis Armstrong, and Gershwin; one posthumous anthology of his recordings was titled \"A Study in Frustration.\" Henderson and his arrangers, especially Don Redman and Fletcher's brother Horace, created the jazz big band format in the 1920s, but had limited commercial success. Other bandleaders, such as Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Artie Shaw achieved much greater success with the Henderson formula in the so-called Swing Era of the 1930s.\nWhen he was still a teen, Herman Poole \"Sonny\" Blount (young Ra) taught himself to transcribe arrangements of Henderson recordings from commercial 78 rpm discs. In 1937 he purchased a steel tape recorder called a \"Soundmirror\" and captured audience recordings of famous bands playing in his hometown of Birmingham. Henderson's outfit, of course, was one of these. Sonny made speedy transcriptions of these numbers, eventually learning the entire Henderson songbook. When Fletcher embarked on a 15-month engagement at Chicago's Club DeLisa in 1946, Ra (who had since relocated to Chicago's South Side) introduced himself to his hero and offered his musical services. Sonny eventually got an opportunity when Henderson's regular pianist failed to show for a gig, and the eager Blount was his replacement for the remainder of the stand.\nIn a 1978 Minneapolis interview, Ra recalled, \"When I first came to Chicago all the musicians would hire me to play trios and things, because they were fascinated with what I was playing. Although I had a lot of enemies who were against what I was playing because I was playing different from other pianists. In fact, in Fletcher Henderson's band I had a lot of enemies, because they said I kept on playing these chords so strange. So finally it came to a point where I had to tell them, 'Look, Fletcher Henderson plays piano, doesn't he?' Yes. 'He hired me, didn't he?' Yes. So I said, 'Don't you think that one piano player knows more about the piano than you do? You playin' horns.' After that, they shut up.\"\nBy the time the extended run ended, Sonny was ready to lead his own band, which evolved into the ever-changing Sun Ra & His Arkestra. Like those of his Swing Era idols, Sun Ra's band was BIG—and he maintained it during an era when few others could sustain large traveling entourages.\nOnly one title in this collection, \"Can You Take It,\" was composed by Fletcher Henderson, and another, \"Big John's Special,\" was written by brother Horace. These titles weren't all first recorded by Henderson or even made famous by him. But these works all received the Henderson treatment, were recorded by him, and became associated with his band. To Sun Ra, all of these works were part of the Henderson legacy, which Ra was driven to preserve.\n\"Big John's Special\" and \"Yeah, Man!\" log dozens of appearances in the Ra discography, and \"Queer Notions\" was also a bandstand favorite. Others, such as \"Great Caesar's Ghost\" and \"Can You Take It\" were rarely performed. Three others—\"Shanghai Shuffle,\" \"Rug Cutter's Swing,\" and \"Tidal Wave\"—are known to have been performed, but aside from a poor-quality rehearsal tape of the first two, no decent recordings of any have surfaced. Oddly, all recordings of Henderson titles by Ra originated at club or concert dates; there are no known studio performances of any Henderson-related works.\nThe recordings in this set span fifteen years, from 1976 to 1991. Most have not been previously issued commercially. Some have been circulating among Ra collectors for decades; in such cases, we have upgraded the audio from original tapes where available. Some tracks are stereo, some mono. Some are beautifully recorded, others less pristine but no less powerful. Some tracks were diligently mixed at the console; others captured ad hoc by staff, fans, or by Ra himself. No surprises here.\nOf particular interest:\n\"Rose Room\" is an extended showcase for John Gilmore's galvanizing sax work. Fans of the tenor genius—take note.\nRollo Radford's mesmerizing electric bass on tracks 1, 10, and 12, from a 1985 set at Stache's. Radford has gone underacknowledged in the chronicles of Ra bassists. His dancing, serpentine lines on these three tracks manage to simultaneously dominate yet complement the arrangements.\nJames Jacson's growling, spirited vocal on Irving Berlin's \"Slumming on Park Avenue.\"\nThere are additional terrific versions of many of these titles, but at present we do not plan a second volume of Hendersonia.\n—I.C.",

            "about": "Holiday For Soul Dance is as close to the jazz mainstream as any Sun Ra album. A rarity in that it contains no original compositions by the leader, Holiday offers seven Tin Pan Alley standards (two by Gershwin), as well as a new work (\"Dorothy's Dance\") by Arkestra trumpeter Phil Cohran.\nCompiled from recordings made in Chicago around July 1960, it was released on Saturn a decade later. The album title, in fact, was configured from words plucked from the track listing. The release was one of five to include songs captured in a marathon 1960 recording session at RCA Studios (and/or possibly Hall Recording) before Sunny's departure for New York. Like most of these delayed releases, Holiday for Soul Dance was less a planned album than a collection of songs that fit thematically.\nThe LP back cover lists 14 musicians, but in fact the personnel appears to consist of a tight septet of Arkestra mainstays, minus the larger rotating musical family. The song choices reflect a nightclub set, and affirm Sunny's enduring fondness for traditional bandstand repertoire. The Arkestra interprets these standards with respect and dignity, offering few hints of the pan-galactic notions swirling in the bandleader's mind at the time. Yet the arrangements—particularly on the uncharacteristically stringless \"Holiday for Strings\"—display Sun Ra's typically masterful craftsmanship. To the discerning ear, idiosyncrasies abound, yet Sunny refuses to sacrifice accessibility. Solos by the band's brass and reeds are tasteful and restrained, but charged with emotion as the compositions require. \"I Loves You Porgy\" and \"Body and Soul\" demonstrate Sun Ra's tender way with ballads, while the rest of the tunes swing—the juxtaposition of styles providing the \"soul\" and \"dance\" respectively. He even manages to namedrop himself in the final track.\n\"Early Autumn\" features the robust baritone vocals of Ricky Murray, who later made an encore cameo on The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra (Savoy, 1961), singing the standard \"China Gate.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Take Nine (from Outer Space)\nLate to the game, I first read about Bill Sebastian's Outer Space Visual Communicator (OVC) in May 2015. It seemed an intriguing sidebar in Sun Ra's half-century career — the planet-hopping Afrofuturist sharing stages (in the late 1970s) with an idiosyncratic fractal light projector created by a man who is literally — and serendipitously — a \"rocket scientist.\" Twenty-two years after Ra's 1993 earthly departure and one year after his commemorative Sun-tenniel, the decade-spanning Ra-OVC alliance seemed (to me) largely forgotten history.\nAround that time I viewed a grainy 1986 video for the Ra perennial \"Calling Planet Earth,\" enhanced with radiant light painting by the OVC. I was curious about the performance. As administrator of the Ra catalog, I'm familiar with most of his known recordings, but couldn't locate this terrific version and wondered where it originated. Sleuthing the web, I discovered that not only was Bill Sebastian still alive — he was still in Boston developing advanced iterations of the OVC, which by then incorporated Virtual Reality (VR) technology. Meanwhile, I had discovered a second 1986 Ra video, \"Sunset on the Nile,\" which also featured the OVC. Again, a first-rate performance, heard nowhere but on a lo-fi VHS tape.\nAfter an introductory phone chat with Bill, what ensued was the improbable evolution of this album. We won't call it THE Great Lost Sun Ra Album, but it is assuredly *A* Great Lost Sun Ra Album. Yet since it was neither envisioned nor existed as an album in the first place, it had never been categorically \"misplaced.\" It was found without having been lost.\nThe backstory is extensive and complex. (Sebastian chronicles the details in an interview included in the LP and CD edition.) Bill was, by turns, a fan, then a friend of Ra, and finally a collaborator. Bill's dream was to create spectacular multi-media audio-visuals combining Ra's music and his OVC.\nBill's brainchild was a keyboard-triggered \"instrument\" that \"played\" colored light instead of sound, projecting wild, multi-hued patterns on a screen hung above performers onstage. He built the archetype in his Boston home in the mid-1970s — long before desktop computers existed. He doggedly refined and improved it, then updated, tweaked and reconfigured the device, until he felt it was ready for public performance.\nAccording to Dave Tompkins, in the 2010 book How to Wreck a Nice Beach: The Vocoder from World War II to Hip-Hop:\n\"Sun Ra finally met the completed OVC in the fall of 1978, in Sebastian's drafty loft in downtown Boston. There, he found his new friend hunched over a small hexagonal keyboard, his fingers flitting across touch-sensitive 'capacitants.' Sebastian was making 'spacescapes,' as if he had Close Encounters on speed dial, consuming 15,000 watts of power in the process. Sebastian [said] he would play the OVC just to keep warm in the winter. 'The capacitants respond to the magnetic field in your hand. … It's like electronic finger-painting. You could shoot comets across the screen. Seventeen million colors at mind-dazzling speeds'.\"\nIn terms of what the OVC might accomplish, Ra and Sebastian were simpatico. As Bill confessed in a 2018 interview with Brian Coleman, \"I have been bored by reality for a long time. We are sending out an invitation to people who want to go someplace different and are willing to fly to destinations unknown.\"\nIn this sense and others, Sun Ra was an ardent fellow voyager.\n\"Sun Ra probably understood what I was doing even better than I did,\" said Bill. \"He was one of the few people who fundamentally understood the concept that music is not restricted to your ears. If you think about when he describes his music, there are these other worlds and they're communicating to you. The idea that those other worlds could communicate through light as well as through sound was, to him, as obvious as it was to me. His comments when he first saw the system were, like, 'Yes, of course. This should've been done fifty years ago. Why did it take you so long?' He was amazed that no one else had done it.\"\nThese compatriots embarked on a string of live performances at Boston's Modern Theater in December 1978, the last on Christmas. In late 1979 they presented a series in New York at Soundscape, and another in June 1980 at the Massachusetts Art Institute. (The latter was captured on videotape, most of which Bill eventually discovered was \"unviewable.\")\n\"The concerts typically began with the Arkestra playing abstract works before Sun Ra appeared,\" Bill recalled. \"The OVC usually generated visuals in those segments, with no lights on the Arkestra. After Ra entered, there were lights onstage and the OVC was more of a complement to the musical performance.\"\nAfter those partnered efforts, Bill returned to the lab to further develop the OVC technology, particularly by adding a video component.\nFast-forward to 1986, when Bill was a technical consultant at Mission Control, a state-of-the-art recording facility in Westford, Massachusetts. Figuring it was time to rekindle his collaborative dream, he invited Ra and bandmates up to the Bay State to experiment. The plan was to record raw soundtracks for carefully crafted performance videos, which would showcase the hallucinatory artistry of the OVC choreographed with Ra's music. Sunny and the Ark spent a full day recording over a dozen works; the proceedings included Ra laying down some improvisations on the then-new Prophet VS polyphonic synth.\nAll live music taping was produced in one day, August 25; the following day, Sebastian captured A- and B-roll Betacam footage of the musicians miming, marching, dancing, and frolicking with and without the OVC, for use in the video mix.\nFrom these exhausting sessions, two titles were mixed. \"Calling Planet Earth\" and \"Sunset on the Nile,\" with added OVC effects, were issued on separate VHS tapes (hand-copied in limited quantities by Sebastian), sold only at Sun Ra gigs.\nSebastian odysseyed on with the OVC, but from a Ra perspective — seeming end of story.\nWhat about the rest of the 1986 Mission Control session?\nIn our first phone call, Sebastian casually remarked that he owned five unmixed 24-track, two-inch analog master tapes. After the two selected songs had been mixed for video, the balance of the recordings were shelved and remained in storage untouched — for three decades. When I asked about the condition and availability of the tapes, Bill professed he had no idea if they would even play, but he offered to retrieve them. I booked a recording studio outside Boston to dust off these relics and hear if the history they captured was still audible. Except for the musicians, engineers, and assistants present at Mission Control in 1986, these performances had never been heard.\nI've often facetiously remarked that Sun Ra never recorded in a Dave Brubeck studio with a Miles Davis budget. This seemed like it could be the closest thing.\n=====\nWhen I reached out to prospective engineers and studios, my preliminary inquiries foretold a daunting task because of the configuration of the tapes (2-inch, 24-track), their age and storage history, and the uncertainty of their durability. Vintage tapes, poorly stored and/or carelessly handled, can deteriorate over time, or disintegrate on playback.\nI called my buddy Sean Slade, who co-founded Boston's Fort Apache Studios in 1985. Slade, who has worked with the Pixies, Lou Reed, Radiohead, Weezer, and a long list of luminaries, also happens to be a longtime Ra fan and attended many Boston shows by the Arkestra. He was familiar with Mission Control, and speculated that the tapes were likely well-recorded and, if unplayed for 30 years, probably safely preserved. We were joined in the studio by another Boston mainstay, Brother Cleve, a longtime mutual friend and fellow Ra scholar, who was also a fine musician (Del Fuegos, Combustible Edison, Waitiki), vintage keyboard authority, and mix engineer. [Note: Sadly, Cleve passed away in 2022.]\nThe tapes were first \"baked\" (yes, as in an oven — don't try this at home) before being transferred to digital — miraculously, without technical glitches — on a rented two-inch deck at Woolly Mammoth Studios in Waltham over two sessions in 2016. During initial playback — the archaeological discovery phase — we reviewed the tape contents and acknowledged that what we captured in ProTools was a brilliant, historic, sprawling multitrack mess. On that August day 30 years earlier, tape had rolled — and it continued rolling, capturing the musical genius and chaos that flowed from Ra and his disciples. In addition to dazzling solos, sparkling ensemble passages, and thrilling arrangements, unedited tapes invariably include false starts, bum notes, missed cues, half-hearted bridges, aborted takes, and good ideas gone bad. Ra was famous for capitalizing on mistakes; he was also highly adept at tape editing — which in capable hands = Quality Control Insurance. We recognized a monumental job ahead shaping this raw material into an album worthy of Ra's legacy.\nWe identified titles (the tape boxes were blank), catalogued how much material had been recorded, how much was potentially worth mixing, and what would likely be consigned to the cutting room floor. Besides mixing, the sessions required serious editing — some of the tracks meandered — but generally the performances were solid. Here and there the band sounded devitalized (possibly travel fatigue) and their performances dragged. Vocalist June Tyson had a sore throat and was hoarse; she sometimes wavered away from the mic. She exuded her customary charm, but out of respect we had to omit some vocal passages where she was painfully straining.\nMissing from Bill's storage space were tapes containing the stereo mixdowns of \"Calling Planet Earth\" and \"Sunset on the Nile\" used on the VHS tapes. It would have been impossible to replicate those mixes from the raw 24-track stripes, so Slade and Cleve created new mixes, and I later made some edits.\nWe also extracted and edited three of Ra's keyboard parts (one piano, two DX7 synth), which are here programmed as interludes. When you listen to the full mixes, often you can't even hear these parts, which are full of intriguing passages, and which sound like something from Ra's legendary 1960s solo piano Saturn LPs Monorails and Satellites.\nThere are no surprises in the repertoire. Each of these titles were performed and/or recorded by Ra countless times with the Arkestra. But as any Raficionado will attest, the maestro never duplicated performances or arrangements. \"Love in Outer Space,\" first recorded in 1962, logs more entries in the Ra discography than any other title, yet after 24 years the Mission Control version is arguably one of his best. Ra never got bored with these works, and he wanted to make certain you didn't either, so he kept shapeshifting. Despite the familiarity of this setlist, everything sounds fresh. And while there was no Miles budget underwriting the sessions, there's some Brubeck-quality fidelity in the grooves. Call it \"Take Nine (From Outer Space).\"\n—Irwin Chusid",

            "about": "Compiled from three Chicago recording sessions, Interstellar Low Ways was a showcase for Sunny's “Space Bop,” “Space Blues,” and his “New Directions” compositions. Stressing his pan-galactic persona, Sun Ra was rapidly pushing jazz farther into the Space Age in his titles, as evidenced by this album's offerings. Musically, he continued looking backward and forward simultaneously, drawing on jazz's rich traditions of swing and bebop, while adding flourishes of modernism that evolved into his unmistakable style. Around this time the Arkestra began to perform live wearing space costumes (which Sunny designed). The arrangements featured various members of the Arkestra doubling on exotic percussion. Two tracks, \"Interplanetary Music\" and \"Rocket Number Nine,\" feature the band's ensemble space chants.\nAt this point in Arkestra history, Sunny was coaching Gilmore to play less hard bop and instead to feel his way around the compositions despite their hard bop arrangements.\nThough the recording sessions were done around 1957-1960, the album was not released until 1966, under the title Rocket Number Nine. In 1969 it was reissued with the above cover and retitled Interstellar Low Ways. Other tracks from these sessions were released on Fate in a Pleasant Mood, Holiday for Soul Dance, Angels and Demons At Play, and We Travel the Spaceways.\nThis digital release features a previously unreleased stereo version of the title track.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Sun Ra's first album was produced in 1956-57 by Tom Wilson for the legendary—and short-lived—Transition Records label. Wilson was fresh out of Harvard (he graduated cum laude in 1955) and launched the Cambridge-based label with audacious early recording dates by Donald Byrd, Cecil Taylor, Jay Migliori, Doug Watkins, Paul Chambers, Pepper Adams, Curtis Fuller, and Louis Smith. (Not all recordings were issued at the time.) How he hooked up with Ra—then based in Chicago and virtually unknown elsewhere—is a bit of a mystery.\nThe set was recorded in July 1956 and issued in 1957. Sun Ra had only recently formed and named the Arkestra, although he had been working with these players on and off for a number of years. The styles shift from hard bop to Third Stream, from Exotica to Ra's emerging concept of Space Jazz. Although the album received very little notice at the time of its original release, it served as a foundational statement for Sun Ra and hints at what was to come.\nTransition went out of business in 1958, the recorded masters were sold to various established labels, and Wilson went on to a legendary career as a producer at Savoy, United Artists, Columbia, and MGM-Verve. Along the way he produced the first two albums by both the Mothers of Invention and the Velvet Underground, as well as the debut of Simon and Garfunkel and four Bob Dylan albums.

            "about": "\"In tomorrow's world, men will not need artificial instruments such as jets and space ships. In the world of tomorrow, the new man will 'think' the place he wants to go, then his mind will take him there.\"\n— Sun Ra, Jazz in Silhouette album notes (1959)\nJazz in Silhouette is the quintessential record of Sun Ra's Chicago period during the late 1950s. Recorded in 1958 and issued in 1959, the album—Ra's third—offers a coda for the bandleader's bebop/hard-bop periods, as his interstellar traveler persona began to vividly evolve at the close of the decade. Sunny's compositions here reflect his talent for writing memorable works in the jazz idiom, even as arrangements like \"Ancient Aiethopia\" point to new directions in amalgamated primitive-futurism. After Ra moved to New York in 1961, he began to explore musical terrain away from jazz conventions. Yet Jazz in Silhouette is resplendent with adventure.\nMany of these early works, including \"Images,\" \"Enlightment,\" and \"Saturn,\" would remain staples in Arkestra set lists for the rest of Sunny's life. These recordings showcase the brilliant tenor sax stylings of John Gilmore and introduce the iconic playing of Marshall Allen and Pat Patrick; all three would remain with Ra for decades (as would bassist Ronnie Boykins). On the extended “Blues At Midnight,” each horn soloist stretches out as in a live club performance. Here, Sun Ra and the band radiate the period's Chicago jazz sound, with lilting melodies, intertwining chords, and surprising dynamic shifts.\nThis expanded edition, issued in vinyl, CD and digital formats, features additional material from the 1958 sessions, along with non-album bonus tracks from the period, some never-before issued, as well as rare stereo mixes. The CD and digital editions feature the full original album in the widely known monophonic mix. The eight album tracks are followed by four bonus tracks, \"State Street\" \"Blues From Saturn,\" the single version of \"Hours After,\" and another single, \"Great Balls of Fire\"; all are in mono.\nThe rest of the deluxe edition—call it Part 2—is in stereo, starting with the album Sound Sun Pleasure (which includes the stereo mix of \"Enlightment,\" a title that appeared in mono on Jazz in Silhouette). This short collection wasn't issued on Saturn until 1970, but the works originated at the same Chicago recording sessions as Jazz in Silhouette. Two tracks feature the sultry vocal stylings of Hattie Randolph, sister of early Arkestra trumpeter Lucious Randolph. The rest of Part 2 features the premiere LP/CD release of five Jazz in Silhouette album tracks in full stereo. Every prior edition of the album had been monophonic. A stereo session tape was discovered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive; five tracks were salvaged (although one is incomplete). The album's second stereo reel, unfortunately, cannot be located.\n[NOTE: The 2-LP expanded vinyl edition does not include the full original mono album. Because of time limitations on each side, the four full stereo mixes were substituted for the mono versions; however, the track sequence has been preserved. The CD and vinyl editions also include a lengthy historical essay by Ra scholar John Corbett and additional illustrations.]\nThis deluxe package also features the original space nymph cover art, which only appeared in cropped and washed-out reproductions on Saturn releases. John Corbett found and preserved the original painting by an artist identified only as \"Evans.\" The colors are more vibrant, and the expanded edition gatefold LP presents previously omitted artwork at the periphery of the untitled painting.\nFinally, all formats of this expanded edition restore the track sequence of the earliest Saturn versions of Jazz in Silhouette; every subsequent reissue has reversed the original sides A and B.\n—I.C.",

            "about": "THE FIRST-EVER COLLECTION OF JUNE TYSON VOCAL PERFORMANCES WITH SUN RA AND HIS ARKESTRA\nUndoubtedly the most sublime constellation in the Sun Ra cosmos, June Tyson’s voice is the perfect guide through one of the most challenging and varied musical legacies ever created. Capable of fierce and sassy declamations as well as intricate melodic weavings, June's voice transcends genre. This first-ever collection affirms June Tyson’s unassailable gravity in Sun Ra’s realm, and features some of June's most popular numbers along with previously unissued tracks. The LP and CD versions include a full color zine-style insert with rare Tyson family photos and extensive liner notes by Cat Celebrezze.\nAs one of Sun Ra’s closest artistic collaborators for almost 25 years, June Tyson represented Afrofuturism as boldly and powerfully as her Saturnian leader. He was the king of Afrofuturism and June was the queen.\nAlso available on LP and CD from Modern Harmonic:\nLP:  bit.ly/2rtwpXl\nCD:  bit.ly/2XQnwmK\nModernHarmonic.com",

            "about": "Hearkening back to the first releases from his own El Saturn record label in the 1950’s, where early Sun Ra records were typically printed in editions of 75 and featured hand-made or pasted-on sleeves, Kingdom of Discipline arrives in 2024 in a physical, hand-made edition of just 75 copies via Dead Currencies.\n\"You've got a solo, John!\" From the opening notes, where we’re dropped in the middle of a rehearsal at Saturn House on Morton Street in West Philadelphia, circa 1978, it’s clear that this is no stuffy jazz label offering. We hear Ra directing some of the legendary cast that would populate his Arkestra. Marshall Allen is on hand, as is John Gilmore. This is, essentially, “lo-fi” from one of the inventors of the genre later exemplified by punk rock and 90’s slacker indie-rock. It's a poetic symmetry for an artist who recorded to Sound Mirror wire tape machines in the 1940’s and self released home recordings before Daniel Johnston was even born. In some ways, Sun Ra has always been the bridge between jazz and punk rock’s DIY ethos. And not just because the MC5 opened for him in their heyday.\nThough in the years since his death there have been many official re-releases and complete documents of live shows, as well as themed collections like the ones focused on Ra’s groundbreaking use of early synthesizers, these tracks were selected and sequenced in a way that offers listeners with eclectic tastes a satisfying trip into an omniiverse that Sun Ra built. Aside from being a further testament to the genius of this singular artist, Kingdom of Discipline is also just a great listening experience.\nTruly mythological characters aren’t as easy to come by in real life as they are in era-defining novels or films. Getting to add to the narrative of a great mythological figure in music, by releasing an incredible new collection of unissued tracks and overlooked obscurities, is a privilege. Sharing it with others is an honor. Doing it justice is a pretty daunting responsibility. Luckily, the mythos and the music that Sun Ra left behind are more than capable of shouldering that weight.\n– JR, Dead Currencies\nAll titles composed by Sun Ra and published by Enterplanetary Koncepts (BMI), except \"Sophisticated Lady\" by Ellington-Mills- Parish, published by EMI Mills Music-SonyATV Harmony\nProduced by Irwin Chusid.

            "about": "\"People are sleeping, and I’m here to wake them up from their slumber.\" — Sun Ra\nLanquidity is one of Sun Ra's most popular albums—because it's something of a \"pop\" effort. Recorded and issued in 1978 on Tom Buchler's short-lived Philly Jazz label, Lanquidity represented a stylistic pivot for Sunny, who had rarely paid much attention to mainstream music trends. Lanquidity, however, is very much of its time, reflecting late-period disco, bottom-heavy funk, and dance-floor soul grooves. Nonetheless, it is very much a Sun Ra album, and steady beats notwithstanding, it's full of surprises, idiosyncrasies, and uncommon moves.\nFrom The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed., 2000), by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent:\n\"Much overdubbing was used on this album. According to Rick Barry of Philly Jazz, Ra requested that Omoe’s name be listed as 'Ego Omoe' on the jacket. Dale Williams says that Disco Kid’s first name was Greg; Disco Kid was responsible for the 'straight' guitar playing while Williams handled the wah-wah and other effects.\"\nThe commercially released master is dense and somewhat muddy. There's an alternate master (same mix) that had been pressed for sale at a 1978 Georgia concert, which was then withdrawn and replaced with this version. Trumpeter Michael Ray claims the first master was rejected by Ra himself—even though Ra sold copies at the Georgia gig. That alternate version has been remastered and will be digitally released soon. The differences are striking.\n==============================\nTOM BUCHLER RECALLS:\nNothing in my life 's experiences prepared me for my first visit to Sun Ra's house, to discuss details regarding the recording of the record that would be called Lanquidity.\nUp several steps, through the door, and I had stepped from the warm summer afternoon of 1978 Germantown, Pennsylvania, into the heat of Sun Ra's incense-filled living room. Perhaps twelve by twenty-four feet, the room contained Ra and several of his keyboards. Stacks of papers, records, sheet music, musical instruments and general household paraphernalia covered every horizontal surface and intersection of wall with floor. (Later Ra explained that if he had used a conventional system of filing, he would only come in contact with what he was looking for. This way, he kept coming into contact with the unexpectedly useful.) Amidst the apparent disarray sat nearly twenty Arkestra members playing Fletcher Henderson tunes at full tilt. That afternoon I was treated to three hours of rehearsal, during which Ra conducted, played his keyboards, adjusted music scores and musicians' attitudes, and generally coaxed and cajoled his musicians into producing sounds that plainly could not be produced solely by the instruments in their hands.\nWith the rehearsal's conclusion, I thought Ra and I would discuss recording session logistics. What I got was metaphysics. In his utterly unflappable manner and with an expression alternating between intense gravity and traces of a grin, Ra proceeded to expound his cosmology. Why did he always talk about outer space? \"When I talk about outer space people listen. People are sleeping, and I'm here to wake them up from their slumber. The right music can wake people up.\" Why wake them up? \"People are concerned about the wrong things. They are concerned about themselves. I'm here to wake them up and show them other things.\"\nOn and on he went. Ra showed me his passport, bearing the name Le Sony'r Ra. He explained that he had come to this planet and lived for a while in Alabama, and had been playing piano since before the age of six. He explained that one day he was asked to play piano in Fletcher Henderson's band. On his first night with the band he so connected with Henderson's intentions that Fletch insisted Ra stay with the band.\nSeveral more days of visits with Ra produced no further logistical negotiations but lots more Cosmo-mythology. Life, truth, lies, God, ego, outer space, the White House, the Black House were discussed.\nFinally, I simply told Sun Ra, \"We've got studio time booked in New York the evening of July 17. I'll pick you up in the afternoon and drive us up to New York. How do we get the band there?\" Ra replied, \"They'll take the van.\"\nRa continued his dialog during the two-hour drive from the suburbs of Philadelphia to downtown Manhattan. We arrived at the studio late in the evening. By three or four in the morning, we had the basic tracks down, recorded to 24-track tape. We began the mixdown, when Ra stopped us and insisted on modifying the track \"There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of).\" In its original state this was a seriously simple and tranquil tune with a plodding rhythm. Several overdubs of Ethnic Voices, synthesizer and percussion later the track took its present form. By dawn we left the studio with final mixed tapes in hand. Ra brought us to a diner he told us served the best grits in New York, and then we were on our way back to Germantown.\nThe musicians' names appear on the album cover the way Ra asked me to spell them. A several-hundred-album run was produced for sale at a concert at Georgia Tech in Atlanta. Those albums have a white cover with a Xeroxed picture of Ra pasted on the front and a sheet with the personnel pasted on the back. The discs themselves have no paper label; the information is scratched onto the center of the disc where the paper label is normally affixed. The remaining albums were released in a silver jacket similar to the cover of this booklet, the vinyl disk with a conventional paper label in silver and magenta.\nThe twenty-two years since that summer have not dimmed Ra's music or message, nor have they diminished its vitality and importance. Ra's music, his act and his stories were designed to make us listen and then look at ourselves. Wake up. Ra will take you to other worlds they have not told you of!\n— Tom Buchler, July 2000",

            "about": "Sun Ra spent part of winter 1977-78 in Italy on a musical odyssey. He may have made two trips, or one extended stay — accounts vary. But his creative activity in a short span was prodigious: a piano recital recorded in Venice, in November 1977; two double-LP studio albums (OTHER VOICES/OTHER BLUES, and NEW STEPS), recorded for the Horo label, in January 1978; and two and a half live albums, recorded in early January, issued on his own Saturn imprint: DISCO 3000, MEDIA DREAMS, and side B of SOUND MIRROR.\nWriting in his 1998 Sun Ra bio, SPACE IS THE PLACE—before any of the above Saturn albums had been reissued in any format (original 1978 pressings probably numbered in the low hundreds)—John Szwed wrote, \"Sonny took a quartet to Italy in early 1978 …, and despite his misgivings about small bands, they produced some concert and studio recordings which are some of the most interesting and little known of the Sun Ra output.\" These projects offer a unique—never before, never after—opportunity to hear Sun Ra's music performed live by a quartet, rather than solo or with some iteration of the legendary Arkestra. MEDIA DREAMS is something of a companion to DISCO 3000, with the distinction that the recording location of the latter is known (Milan's Teatro Ciak), but the location of the former is not. DISCO 3000 is also the better-recorded tape, but MEDIA DREAMS won't disappoint Ra fans who know better than to expect Rudy Van Gelder-perfection from the Saturn catalog.\nAccompanying Ra in Italy were mainstay tenor saxophonist John Gilmore; trumpeter Michael Ray, a relative newcomer; and another recent recruit, drummer Luqman Ali (Edward Skinner), who had joined the Arkestra in early 1977. Ra played grand piano and the idiosyncratic (and short-lived) electronic console, the Crumar Mainman. Gilmore also took a turn on drums, and everybody sang (though most of the Italy recordings are instrumental).\nInvented in 1977 by the Italian company Crumar (the name is a portmanteau of founders Mario Crucianelli and F. Marchetti), the device was an early polyphonic synth, capable of a variety of sounds and effects, including programmable percussion. Ra's model was reportedly one of less than a dozen prototypes; the product was eventually scrapped and never marketed. Musician and keyboard historian (and Ra scholar) Brother Cleve says, \"It was pretty much a glorified string ensemble that included brass, bass, and percussion options. You could also add fuzz tones, and use the volume pedal for a number of effects.\" The Mainman could also replicate a piano, but Ra had access to acoustic pianos on all Italy dates.\nThe original 1978 Saturn LP of MEDIA DREAMS featured six works—on Side A, \"Saturn Research,\" \"Constellation,\" and \"Yera [sic] of the Sun\"; on Side B, \"Media Dreams,\" \"Twigs at Twilight,\" and \"An Unbeknowneth Love.\" Almost 30 years later, additional concert tapes surfaced, which provided the British label Art Yard with enough material for a 13-track 2-CD set, issued in 2008. When Art Yard's license expired after 2020, the rights reverted to Sun Ra LLC, and this digital release is the current iteration of the set. There are minor differences.\nThe later tape discoveries revealed that the Saturn track \"Twigs at Twilight,\" featuring torching tenor work from John Gilmore, was in fact an excerpt of Ra's evergreen \"Images\" (a work which dated from his late 1950s Chicago period). For this 2022 digital reissue, \"Twigs\" (which was included on the Art Yard CD) is replaced by the complete \"Images.\" \"An Unbeknowneth Love\" was abridged on the Saturn LP; this abridged version as well as the later-discovered full version were both included on the Art Yard CD. We have included just the full version. \"Of Other Tomorrows Never Known\" originally appeared on the Saturn LP SOUND MIRROR; Art Yard added it to their 2-CD set, and we followed suit. Finally, \"Space is the Place\" and a brief opening passage of \"The Shadow World\" were listed as two tracks on the Art Yard CD, but they were performed inseparably and are here listed as a medley.\nHaving conquered Italy, less than a week after this frenetic intercontinental expedition, Ra was back performing in the U.S.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "\"I have always thought orchestra. I play that way, even when playing the piano.\" — Sun Ra\nMonorails and Satellites were two volumes of solo piano works recorded by Sun Ra in 1966. Volume 1 was issued on his Saturn label in 1968, volume 2 the following year. They were the first commercial LPs of the artist's solo keyboard excursions. Vol. 1 featured seven idiosyncratic Sun Ra originals and one standard delivered in Sunny's singular manner. Vol. 2 consists entirely of original compositions. A tape of a third, unreleased volume was discovered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive. Released here for the first time, it consists of five originals and four standards, and was recorded in stereo.\n[STEALTH EDIT: In early 2022 we discovered a stereo master of Vol. 1. On June 3 of that year, we replaced the Vol. 1 mono digital versions with stereo.]\nDespite Sun Ra's obsession with the future, Monorails and Satellites is something of a nostalgia trip. As a youth in Birmingham, Alabama, the man who became Sun Ra—Herman Poole Blount—spent hours at the Forbes Piano Company, amusing himself (as well as staff and customers) at the showroom keyboards. He practiced standards, emulated his piano heroes, played the latest pop songs, and improvised. The idyllic reveries which the teen experienced in those formative years were no doubt recaptured during the Monorails sessions.\nThe playing here speaks less of a style, and more of a collection of statements. Some of the tunes, with their odd juxtapositions of mood, could be mistaken for silent film scores. Perhaps they were audio notebooks, a way to generate ideas which could be developed with the band (\"I think orchestra\"). Regardless of any secondary (and admittedly speculative) intent, they serve as compelling standalone works. The fingering reflects Sun Ra's encyclopedic knowledge of piano history as his passages veer from stride to swing, from barrelhouse to post-bop, from march to Cecil Taylor-esque free flights, with a bit of soothing \"candelabra\" swank thrown in. Sunny's attack is mercurial, his themes unpredictable. His hands can be primitive or playful, then abruptly turn sensitive and elegant. As with the whole of Sun Ra's recorded legacy, you get everything but consistency and predictability.\nThe listener also experiences something rare in the Sun Ra recorded omniverse: intimacy. His albums, generally populated by the rotating Arkestral cast, are raucous affairs. With the Monorails sessions, we eavesdrop on private moments: the artist, alone with his piano. These are brief audio snapshots of what was surely a substantial part of Sun Ra's life, infinitesimal surviving scraps of 100,000 hours similarly spent, most lost to posterity.\nThe 2-CD and 3-LP packages of this set include an essay by three-time Down Beat Artist of the Year VIJAY IYER, along with a historical chronicle by jazz authority BEN YOUNG.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "MY BROTHER THE WIND, released by Sun Ra in 1970 (but recorded in 1969) is one of several albums that showcase Sun Ra's initial reckonings with the then-recently introduced Moog synthesizer. Within a few years this chapter of Ra's legacy included My Brother the Wind Vol. 2, The Night of the Purple Moon, Space Probe, and The Solar-Myth Approach, Vol. 2. Although the Astro Infinity Arkestra is credited on most copies of the original LP sleeve for My Brother the Wind, in fact only three sidemen were on the session—Marshall Allen, John Gilmore, and Danny Davis, with Moog performance pioneer Gershon Kingsley serving as synth programmer and technical consultant.\nSun Ra was not seeking to reproduce existing music with the Moog; he saw the device (and electronic instruments generally) as futuristic, offering ear-opening—and galaxy-traversing—possibilities. In 1969 Apollo 11 had landed on the moon; Sun Ra made alternate travel arrangements. \"I wasn't using any gasoline. I'm using sound,\" he explained (about his mythic Black Space Program). \"You haven't reached that stage on this planet yet where you can use sound to run your ships and run your cars and heat your house. Your scientists haven't reached that yet. But it will happen. Where you can take a cassette and put it in your car and it will run it—with the right kind of music, of course. And it won't explode.\"\nThe Moog would help Sun Ra achieve lift-off.\nWith the Arkestra Sunny could occasionally revisit and reinvent music of yesterday; the Moog was about tomorrow. This approach ran counter to the initial commercial trend of the instrument. During the late 1960s and early 1970s countless high-profile LPs featured Moog-based interpretations of everything from the Beatles to Bach to Bacharach. There were exceptions (e.g., Paul Bley, Caldera, Perrey & Kingsley, Beaver & Krause, even the Monkees), but the prevailing aesthetic was to apply this novel instrument to familiar melodies. Although such albums took minimal risk, they helped popularize the invention by adapting hits and standards, thus broadening the otherworldly Moog's appeal.\nSun Ra had broader horizons. Given access to a Moog modular system in 1969, he went into Kingsley's New York studio, punched the record button, and embarked on a sonic adventure. The resulting LP was entitled simply My Brother the Wind. There was no \"Volume 1,\" a designation which was retroactively applied after Ra released \"Volume 2\" shortly thereafter. (Volume 2, which was not an all-Moog outing, contained several Moog solo tracks recorded at the R.A. Moog factory, in Trumansburg, New York, during Sun Ra's visit in summer 1970.)\nThe original My Brother the Wind LP on Saturn (catalog 521) featured four tracks, properly sequenced here on as tracks 1–4. For this expanded release, tracks 5–7 feature three complete session takes of \"The Perfect Man.\" The third and final complete take was issued in 1974 on Side B of Saturn 45 rpm single ES 537, reissued in 1983 on Saturn 9/7474, and included on the Evidence 2-CD set The Singles in September 1996. The alternate takes have not been previously issued.\nTrack 8 features the monumental \"Space Probe,\" a solo Moog work recorded around the same time—and possibly performed on a Minimoog. This track was originally released in 1974 on the Saturn LP Space Probe, which appeared in a number of hybrid configurations during the 1970s. On at least one iteration, taped to the generic back cover was a typewritten card which claimed \"Space Probe,\" described as a \"moog [sic] solo,\" had been \"recorded in Chicago, 1960's\"—a fanciful claim at best.\nThe LP and CD editions include liner notes by Moog historian Brian Kehew. Historical and technical liner notes are provided by noted jazz historian Ben Young, who restored and remastered the album with his Triple Point Records partner Joe Lizzi. Both men have been recognized for their production work on HOLY GHOST, the Grammy-nominated ALBERT AYLER boxed set released on John Fahey’s Revenant Records in 2005.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "With Sun Ra you get everything but consistency and predictability. My Brother the Wind Vol. II is no exception. On the original 1971 Saturn LP, side one consisted of sizzling Afrosoul, highlighted by June Tyson's vocals and Sunny's simmering \"intergalactic organ\" (a Farfisa). Ra discographer Robert Campbell calls it \"spaced-out barbecue music,\" and it's one of the most accessible outings in the artist's first post-Chicago decade. Side two is a non sequitur, consisting of Sun Ra giving a new Minimoog a workout. Artist's prerogative — two Sun Ra's in one (often the case with his oddly juxtaposed LP tracks).\nThe ensemble pieces (1-6) were recorded at Variety Studios, probably in early 1970. This is a tight band, and with the exception of \"Contrast,\" these tracks feature something not found on many studio recordings by Ra in the 1960s—a groove, one closer to roadhouse R&B than jazz. There's a bit of Memphis blues, a touch of Booker T & the MGs, albeit with Sun Ra's usual disregard for Top 40 niceties. The horns contribute some characteristically spirited solos.\nHowever, nothing foreshadowed what awaited the listener who flipped the platter.\nIn 1969, Sun Ra had recorded on Moog synth modules at the New York midtown studio of Gershon Kingsley. Those recordings were issued on My Brother the Wind, Vol. 1 (although it was not titled \"Vol. 1\"— it only achieved that reference after \"Vol. 2\" appeared). The following year, drummer Tommy Hunter arranged a meeting between Sun Ra and synth pioneer Robert Moog in upstate Trumansburg, New York, to demonstrate the new Minimoog. Tracks 7 thru 11 were reportedly recorded at this demo session (see notes below), after which the inventor offered Sunny one of the first Minimoogs to take on the road. It was a custom model, and may have been handed off just before the unit appeared on the consumer market.\nBecause of the ad hoc nature of the session, the Moog works, though titled, sound improvised, as Sunny tests the keyboard action, seeks chromatic capabilities, and adjusts tones and timbres. Fans of Switched-On Bach may be horrified (just as many fans of Bach were horrified by Switched-On). With the Moog, Sun Ra was not looking to reproduce existing music; he was exploring the unknown, tapping into the future, levitating thru the cosmic flux, as the titles indicate.\nBecause of sub-optimal recording conditions, the tracks are lo-fi and several display severe distortion. We have elected to leave in some of the distortion (particularly on tracks 10 and 11) because suppressing it would have removed a significant part of the audio signal. This is, in fact, how the originals sound on the tapes and on original Saturn LPs. We do not believe this distortion was caused by tape aging or poor storage. This is what Sun Ra recorded and commercially released. The results may not be sonically pristine, but they do reflect historic early encounters between an adventurous musician and a new music-making technology, one that Sunny would use often in concerts and recording sessions over the next few years.\n– I.C.\nP.S. Professor Tom Rhea explains the evolution of the Minimoog:  youtube.com/watch?v=JrAFMi-VV6E",

Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive insists these were recorded at the R.A. Moog factory, in Trumansburg, New York. If Ra did in fact play Minimoog, the year had to be 1970 at the earliest, because the Mini was not invented until that year.\nAll titles composed by Sun Ra © Enterplanetary Koncepts (BMI)\nTape transfers by Michael D.

No bassist. The tracks were issued on a double LP in '78.\nAccording to notes in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent), \"Sun Ra frequently used his Crumar keyboard to program repeated lines and 'drum' sequences throughout the January 1978 sessions in Italy.\" These sessions also produced a companion double album, \"Other Voices, Other Blues,\" with the identical personnel.",

            "about": "When people think of Sun Ra's \"greatest hit,\" the obvious answer is \"Space is the Place.\" It's Sun Ra's \"Stairway to Heaven\" (in terms of ubiquity—and in a celestial sense as well). Yet \"Nuclear War\" is a surprise contender. The 1982 recording originally appeared on the 1983 LP A Fireside Chat with Lucifer (Saturn Gemini 19841) and in Great Britain on a 12\" single (Y RA 1). Since it's digital reissue in 2014, it has consistently been one of the top downloaded single tracks in Ra's catalog.\nThomas Stanley, in his ambiguously titled 2014 book, The Execution of Sun Ra, observes, \"Throughout his life [Sun Ra] was consistent in his opposition to war and his art reflected this, perhaps most sharply in the space chant 'Nuclear War.' 'It's a motherfucker, don't you know,' Sun Ra and trombonist Tyrone Hill [joined by June Tyson] sing over a deceptively sparkly chromatic piano line played at a steady walking rhythm. It's worth noting that this spicy chunk of language is the only use of profanity in Sunny's vast recorded song repertory.\"\nIndeed, the vocal and instrumental arrangements on \"Nuclear War\" are so matter-of-fact, so devoid of urgency, a listener unaware that it is a Sun Ra composition could be forgiven for thinking it was a parody of a punk rock anthem. \"Nuclear War\" is Punk Jazz.\nThe band Yo La Tengo has twice issued commercial recordings of the tune, and it has long remained in their repertoire. YLT has also performed other tunes associated with Ra: \"Dreaming,\" \"Somebody's In Love,\" \"Interplanetary Music,\" and \"Hot Skillet Mama.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "By the late 1960s, Sun Ra & His Arkestra were gaining a reputation for staging multidimensional spectacles that could pack large venues. In particular, an April 1968 two-night multi-media Carnegie Hall debut, arranged by Willis Conover and his wife, had been wildly successful. As recounted by John Szwed in his Sun Ra biography Space Is The Place, \"Conover had been urging Sun Ra to take the Arkestra to Europe for some time and assured him that … the time was right. So when an offer came for them to play a pair of concerts at the Fondation Maeght in the south of France, they began making preparations.\" Shows were booked for August 1970.\nThe Maeght Foundation is a modern art museum in southeast France, tucked away in the back country hills above Nice. Established by Marguerite and Aimé Maeght in 1964, it owns a fabulous collection of paintings, sculptures, collages, and ceramics (over 12,000 works) by countless 20th-century icons, including Arp, Matisse, Kandinsky, Dubuffet, Bonnard, Braque, Calder, Chagall, Giacometti, Léger and Miró. They also host music performances and other public events.\nRa's Fondation Maeght dates were not part of a tour. The Arkestra’s first European tour began on October 9, 1970, at Les Halles, in Paris. The Maeght gigs qualify as exploratory visits. Despite much controversy (see below), they were successful and led to the increased use of Ra's Earthly passport over the next two decades—to Europe and beyond.\nSpeaking of passports, Szwed offers the following vignette, based on Ra's customary (and factual, you understand) assertion that he was born on Saturn:\n\"When [the Arkestra] filled out the forms at the passport office in New York City, the clerk at the desk said to Sun Ra, 'Sir, you’re going to have to give us better information than this. We need your parents’ names, your birth date.' [Dancer] Verta Mae Grosvenor recalled that Sun Ra said, 'That *is* the correct information.’ After a few minutes the clerk went back to speak to her supervisor. Sun Ra was only wearing his day wear, but it was still pretty out! The supervisor was no-nonsense, but after talking to Sun Ra she said, ‘Sir, why don’t you come back in a few hours.’ When we came back there was another person there and he knew about it, and he said, ‘We’ll just give you the passport.’ It got so *out* that they just gave it to him!”\nWhat Sun Ra and his entourage presented at Maeght startled patrons, critics, artists, and journalists. In short, most eyewitnesses didn't know what to make of it. Szwed chronicles the event nicely:\n\"Nineteen musicians and dancers were on the stage on the evening of August 3. The audience had little or no knowledge of Sun Ra’s music, since his records weren’t widely distributed in France, and when they arrived they saw the Arkestra spread out before them like elaborate decor: musicians in red tunics, seated in a forest of instruments on stage, dancers in red dresses. On a screen behind them was projected a sky full of stars, then planets, children in Harlem, Indians on hunting trips, and newsreel footage of protests; a ball of 'magic fire' rose slowly up to the ceiling; saxophonists began to battle like samurai, then came together like brothers; and in the still center of it all, Sun Ra sat behind the Moog, creating the sounds of gales, storms, and waves crashing. From the very first note, an agitated woman stood up and cried out, 'What is *this*?' Afterwards she came up and insisted on seeing the written music. Europeans seemed to want to know whether there was music behind what they were hearing, as if it would assure them that this was rational activity, and Sonny was always happy to show them the scores. A man once blurted out that his 'five-year-old daughter could play that!' Sun Ra readily agreed: 'She could play it, but could she write it?'\"\nThe Maeght recordings were taped for broadcast by French state-sponsored radio, and filmed. Selections from the concerts were issued in 1971 as two separate LPs on the French label Shandar, and later reissued in various formats—some legitimate, some not.\nThe Arkestra returned to France in November for a concert at Theatre du Chatelet in Paris. Szwed quotes one disappointed jazz critic, Jean-Robert Masson, who—perhaps naively—noted a disconnect between what Ra presented live in 1970 and what he had recorded in 1965:\n\"I was perplexed listening to the records from [Fondation Maeght]: nothing was happening, so to speak. How could the same orchestra who had made the orchestrally rich [1965 'Heliocentric Worlds' records on ESP-Disk] be the same one who made the [Maeght] records, which were almost immobile, and which reduced itself to a crude and simple rhythmic event. I had to conclude that the gestural and visual element had a very large place in the spectacles of Sun Ra which wasn’t evident from listening to the ESP records. The evening at Chatelet just underlined this, going all the way to caricature.\"\nMasson was hardly the first—or last—music critic to be \"perplexed.\" Ra-ficionados might argue that such reactions were part of Ra's game plan. The word \"compromise\" cannot easily be used in the same sentence as \"Sun Ra\" without an intervening negative. As Ra himself noted in 1966: \"A lot of people say that I’m just playing around, but it's not like that. I know music from head to tail, I know all the laws of music, I was reared up playing classics and I went to college and studied music for teacher’s training, so I KNOW music. But I’m just following my own way, and I know what I’m doing.\"\n— I.C.",

            "about": "From The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed.), by Robert Campbell and Christopher Trent, we offer this preface:\n\"The Arkestra was 'in residency' at the Jazz Center in Detroit for nearly a week (a poster in the possession of [drummer] Samarai Celestial advertises 11 shows [from December 26, 1980 to January 1, 1981]). Rick Steiger and John Sinclair produced the events. Paintings from Ra's private collection were on display in the hall; films from his collection were shown, and a slide show called Sun Ra Through the Ages, featuring photography by Leni Sinclair, was presented.\"\nFrom the over 26 hours of concert music (which included some afternoon workshops) over six days, material was culled for two LPs released on Ra's own label: Beyond the Purple Star Zone (released 1981), and Oblique Parallax (released 1982). The title track of Beyond the Purple Star Zone and the first section of \"Journey Stars Beyond\" on Oblique Parallax are the same performance, but with different mixes.\nThrough nominally credited to Sun Ra's Omniverse Jet-Set Arkestra (a shifting cast of Arkestra mainstays and Detroit-based players), Oblique Parallax in fact features the leader performing solo on tracks 1 and 2 (which were combined as one track on the Saturn LP), while track 3, \"Celestial Realms,\" offers the trio of Ra on keyboards, Vincent Chancey on French horn, and Samarai Celestial on drums. Track 4, the three-part \"Journey Stars Beyond\" (side B on the LP), includes additional players, though Ra, Chancey and Celestial are showcased. This extended track does not chronicle a single performance; the opening trio section was recorded during a different set and edited on.\nThe audio quality of these recordings is comparable to many captured Sun Ra performances: flawed, but soulful; mid-fidelity, but high-octane. We have attempted to remove as much distortion as possible from the French horn and keyboards, but ultimately this noise is part of the documented performance and cannot easily be subtracted by existing technology.\nIn 2010 the British label Art Yard packaged the contents of both LPs on a commercial CD, which included fascinating reminiscences by Rick Steiger, co-producer of Sun Ra's historic Detroit stand. Other soundboard tapes from the Detroit concerts have circulated among fans over the years, and some have been issued on inferior quality bootlegs.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "OF ABSTRACT DREAMS\nFrom the 1940s onward until his departure from planet Earth in 1993, Sun Ra assiduously documented his music. Between early 1972 and summer 1973, Ra and his Arkestra engaged in a spate of studio recording sessions in California, Chicago and Philadelphia, the results of which produced an extraordinary run of albums: 'Astro Black’, ‘Space Is The Place’, ‘Discipline 27-II', ‘Cymbals’, ‘Crystal Spears’, 'Pathways To Unknown Worlds’, ‘Friendly Love', one side of the 1978 LP ‘Of Mythic Worlds’ and the entire soundtrack to the film ‘Space Is The Place’.\n1974 saw the Arkestra maintain a busy performing schedule across the USA while Ra also prepared a series of Saturn LPs featuring live concert material coupled with older studio recordings. Until now, the Saturn LP ‘The Antique Blacks’, recorded at radio station WXPN FM, represented the only studio recording to have been made between the second half of 1973 and the recording of the LP ‘Cosmos’ in France in August 1976.\nIn his efforts to continuously document his music, Sun Ra was always looking for new recording opportunities. Ra archivist Michael D. Anderson explains; “From 1974 through 1980, The Arkestra recorded a series of recordings in the WXPN studios. WXPN is on the campus of The University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Then-station manager Jules Epstein and music director Russ Woessner were instrumental in the exposure and recording of The Arkestra. As an inexpensive means to record in Philadelphia, they offered Sunny the opportunity to record in the WXPN production studios. The station was also associated with concert entrepreneur Geno Barnhart, founder of The Empty Foxhole concert collective (1969-1982). Each weekend, WXPN broadcast and recorded concerts from The Foxhole. Sadly, in the 1990s, WXPN changed its format and discarded most of the master tapes in dumpsters outside the studio.”\n‘Of Abstract Dreams’ preserves a single session from this seemingly lost legacy of recordings. As with many other Sun Ra recordings, there are no documented details, and all information has been gleaned through aural detective work by Michael D. Anderson (with Irwin Chusid of Sun Ra LLC) who unearthed the tape reel and surmised that this session took place in either 1974 or 1975.\nFour tracks were recorded: two chants familiar from live performances, 'I’ll Wait For You’ and ‘Unmask The Batman’; one seldom heard title, ‘Island In The Sun’ and a spontaneous composition titled ‘New Dawn’. A small Arkestra is present, made up of then-residents of the Ra house in Morton Street, Philadelphia. Ra plays piano throughout, John Gilmore, Marshall Allen and Eloe Omoe are on reeds, Akh Tal Ebah plays trumpet and there are two dedicated percussionists, probably Eddie Thomas on kit and Atakatune on congas. Everyone adds vocals, handclaps or both. The mono recording, dry radio room sound and bass-less ensemble gives a low key feel and sound to the session. The fire and commitment to the Omniversal moment is always there but the emphasis is mostly on cyclic groove. The tracks show the group in a less declamatory and more discursive mode.\nPrior to this release, ‘Island In The Sun’ had appeared just once in the vast Ra discography, on the Saturn LP ‘The Invisible Shield.' This recording shows the song’s close compositional kinship with Ra’s piece ‘Spontaneous Simplicity'. The groove and piano figures at the beginning of the track are essentially the same as those heard on its frequently played compositional cousin. However, the eight bars of distinctive melody, played at the start on Marshall Allen’s flute, signify this track as 'Island In The Sun’. The melody (heard in full AABA form at the track's conclusion) is one of Ra’s deceptively simple themes, sunny but with a melancholy edge. This version opens with a dark modal swing feel but builds to a vibrant and propulsive central section before once more becoming elusive and numinous toward the close.\n‘New Dawn' rises with disquisitive piano and alto sax exclamations from Ra and Marshall Allen before Ra ushers in a brooding rhythmic groove. Eloe Omoe takes over the lead on a brief bass clarinet solo before John Gilmore delivers a searching but concise solo.\nRa sketches a new modal background riff for his own solo, spraying showers of high note runs, before Gilmore returns with the horns harmonizing Ra’s left hand. The music changes direction and heads for arrhythmic percussive space with Allen pushing the sonic extremes of the oboe. The track then fades quickly and without a decisive ending, suggesting an edit from a longer recording.\nRa demonstrates his deep affinity with and profound understanding of piano blues styles on ‘I'm Gonna Unmask The Batman’. Co-composed by Chicago blues performer Lacy Gibson and Alton Abraham, Sun Ra’s business partner in Saturn Records, it features Arkestra reedman and percussionist James Jacson on lead vocal utilizing a distinctive growl that sits somewhere between Louis Armstrong and Screamin’ Jay Hawkins. John Gilmore takes another great solo, mixing trenchant blues phrases with spiraling free runs. Ra makes up for the absence of a bass player on the session with constant roiling bass figures. His punchy right hand chords and the percussionists shore up the groove before the track concludes with a Ra-signaled space chord and the band heading skywards.\n‘I’ll Wait For You' concludes the session in its first known studio recording as a fully-fledged composition. It had featured in Arkestra concerts for some years as a poetic recitation by Ra in tandem with singer and dancer June Tyson, but here it emerges as a fully formed piece with Afro-jazz overtones. Ominous piano trills herald more dark piano blues with drums and congas. Gilmore enters the space with another supercharged solo backed by the horns. Ra lays out, leaving Gilmore alone with the percussion. An Arkestral voice recites the Ra text followed by Ra himself, then joined by other voices while Gilmore continues his otherness blues. A burst of space sound with Akh Tal Ebah’s trumpet to the fore revitalizes the groove. Omoe overblows the bass clarinet, followed by more Gilmore in extreme multi-phonic territory. The Arkestra create a brief wall of sound before the track concludes with vocals, drums and congas.\nFor Sun Ra and the Arkestra, music was played not just to relay a message for humanity but also as an ongoing paean to ‘the creator of the universe’, every tone, sound and utterance of vital importance to the Omniverse. This session, unheard for over forty years since it was recorded, once more demonstrates the vitality of Ra and his master musicians and constitutes another important entry into what Ra called “music of the private library of God”.\nPaul Griffiths, November 2017",

            "about": "Of Mythic Worlds, containing five tracks (three on side A, two on side B), was first issued on LP in 1980 on the short-lived Philly Jazz label (PJ 1007), owned by Tom Buchler. The only other Sun Ra release on PJ was the widely acclaimed Lanquidity (1978). OMW was never issued on CD, the rights reverted to Sun Ra LLC in 2014, and this digital reworking is the first reissue. The album still contains five tracks, but they're not the same five tracks. In fact, the title track has been omitted. There's a reason for that.\nSun Ra often configured his albums from mismatched sources. Tracks could have originated from different sessions recorded years apart, in different studios, and featuring different bands. He would combine live and studio material; in some cases, the contents were recorded in different decades. (The 1973 album Deep Purple featured tracks from the early 1970s coupled with tracks from the late 1940s and mid-1950s!)\nNo recording dates were provided on the OMW LP sleeve, though \"Recorded in Chicago\" was written below the two titles on side B. Did that geographical citation apply to the side B tracks only, or to the entire album? Consider a third possibility — that it was typical Ra misdirection.\nThe discographic Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, 2nd ed. 2000) says, \"The proprietors of Philly Jazz knew nothing of the origins of the tape.\" Trent later wrote, \"The album has the matrix numbers 9791A and 9791B. These presumably are the dates for the Philly Jazz transfer of the tapes and/or remastering. Previously these numbers misled us into thinking these might be recording dates.\" Rick Barry, of Philly Jazz, wrote to Ra scholar/friend Hartmut Geerken in June 1980, \"I am afraid I don't know the personnel or the recording date of Of Mythic Worlds, and I'm not sure anybody does. Sun Ra was not certain of all the personnel.\"\nBy studying the performances on side A, eventually Campbell was able to identify the personnel. By tracking these musicians' tenures with the Arkestra and comparing personnel to known tour stops, it was determined that these three tracks — \"Mayan Temples,\" \"Over the Rainbow,\" and \"Inside the Blues\" — were probably recorded in April 1978 at The Left Bank Jazz Society in Baltimore. Portions of this concert were included in the 1980 Robert Mugge film \"A Joyful Noise,\" which helped to identify personnel.\nHowever, the tracks on side B—\"Intrinsic Energies\" and \"Of Mythic Worlds\"—were something of a mystery. They're not live—they're studio recordings. They sound unlike the contents of side A, with different personnel and instrumentation. In fact, they do not sound contemporaneous.\nEnter Michael D. Anderson, of the Sun Ra Music Archive. Anderson insisted that the two tracks on side B were in fact unreleased tracks from the Pathways to Unknown Worlds sessions, which were recorded at Variety Studios in New York (in 1972, says Anderson, not '73, as indicated in Earthly Recordings). Pathways had been issued on Impulse in 1975 as part of an ill-fated 1973 licensing deal struck by Ra and manager Alton Abraham with ABC-Dunhill Records.\nAfter reviewing the evidence (including personnel, instruments, and composing/arranging styles), Trent wrote in the 2014 Art Yard book Omniverse Sun Ra: \"Re-evaluating [the tracks], they are indeed taken from a studio recording, not a rehearsal or live recording, and the sound and musical style of Sun Ra's electronics are compatible with the 1973 [sic] date.\"\nHence, these two tracks have been omitted from this digital reissue; they were reassigned to the 2019 Modern Harmonic label's definitive reissue of Pathways to Unknown Worlds (available in all formats).\nIn place of these two tracks, we have included two previously unreleased medleys performed by the Sun Ra Quartet at the Moers Music Festival, West Germany, in 1979. The recording quality is excellent (these originated from a radio broadcast), the performances are relatively close in the Ra chronology, and the repertoire is compatible with the three OMW live tracks. Part of the Moers performance was preserved on a 14-minute radio broadcast (there is a complete audience tape running 45 minutes), on which the personnel was announced. One additional title, a solo piano rendition of \"Over the Rainbow,\" is available as a bonus track on our digital edition of the Ra solo piano album Aurora Borealis.\n—I.C.",

            "about": "NOTE: This is a 2021 remaster of Omniverse, which is also available from Modern Harmonic on LP and CD. The CD and digital editions contain two bonus tracks (details below). The following liner notes are adapted from our 2015 five-track digital reissue of the original Saturn album.\n====================\nOmniverse, recorded in New York in 1979 and released that year on Sun Ra's Saturn label, has been gathering dust for too long. It's a fine, overlooked item in the vast Ra catalog. The tracks aren't so much compositions as they are excursions, with only a few memorable themes or recurring motifs. It's pure jazz, somewhat \"inside\" (for Sun Ra), with little of the aggressiveness and confrontation for which the bandleader was known. (Track 5, \"Visitant of the Ninth Ultimate,\" is an exception.) Omniverse is a very intimate album, offering lots of reflective piano in trio, quartet, and quintet settings, with spare horns. But instead of exhibiting a keyboard showcase, Sun Ra engages in dynamic interplay with the rhythm section. Moreover, the horns are featured largely as soloists; there are few ensemble passages.\nThree of the works (tracks 3, 4 and 5) exist as recordings only on this album; there are no documented concert performances of these titles. \"West End Side of Magic City\" (a reference to the bandleader's birth town of Birmingham, Alabama) doesn't reappear in the known repertoire for twelve years—it surfaces at a May 1991 Atlanta concert, and was reprised in August at a New York club date (for which the piece was announced from the stage as \"Vita Number 5\"). \"The Place of Five Points\" is known to have been performed at a smattering of gigs between 1985-1988.\nThe massive and authoritative Campbell/Trent discography, The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed.) lists personnel provided retrospectively by drummer Samarai Celestial, whose account includes two baritone saxophones and trumpet on tracks 4 and 5, as well as Ra overdubbing drums on 5. However, no baritone or trumpet can be heard on either track, although there are baritone and muted trumpet on track 3, and there is a second drummer on track 1. (This is not a knock on The Earthly Recordings, which is encyclopedic in scope, and which has required the authors to sort through contradictions, uncertainties, and unknowables inherent in the cosmic legacy of Sun Ra.) An LP copy with a plain white label turned up on eBay, and bears a circular pen inscription indicating six musicians, who are listed here.\nThere was no official album sleeve for the Omniverse LP. Existing copies feature hand-artwork and pasted graphics on generic cardboard sleeves. One of these has been adapted for the \"cover\" of this digital release.\nThe 2021 Modern Harmonic CD edition included two bonus tracks, both of which were issued for the first time on two of our expanded digital releases: a Sun Ra solo piano rendition of \"Over the Rainbow,\" one of Sunny's favorite and often-performed standards. This performance originated from Germany's Moers Music Festival in June 1979, and was added to our digital remastering of the all-solo piano album AURORA BOREALIS. Finally, \"The Sound Mirror,\" featuring the Arkestra, is not the version which appeared as the title track on Saturn #19782 in 1978. This performance, believed to date from late 1977 or early 1978, features a tighter arrangement and greater sonic clarity. We first issued it on the digital remastering of TAKING A CHANCE ON CHANCES. The versions of both tracks are identical to the digital versions found on those two albums, so pardon the overlap.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Sun Ra, as well as anyone, proved that an artist could change with the times without being a dedicated follower of fashion. In fact, Ra and his music never stopped evolving. A series of albums recorded from 1978 to 1980—Lanquidity, On Jupiter, Sleeping Beauty, and Strange Celestial Road—demonstrate the influence on Ra of musical and production trends of the mid- and late-1970s, especially heavy, studio-enhanced dance floor grooves (traceable from soul and funk to disco), and atmospheric New Age \"dream\" pieces. But Ra never fully surrendered to these trends; it's arguable that he even embraced them. He adapted techniques, but what he created amounted more to reinventions than \"File Under\" genre works.\nRodger Coleman, writing in 2008 at his Sun Ra Sundays blog about the albums On Jupiter and Sleeping Beauty, said: \"These two 1979 Saturn sessions present Sun Ra at his most accessible — groovy, dreamy, spacey, and suitably cosmic while reigning in the full-blown freakouts that can make Sun Ra’s music difficult for some .... That is not to say that these are lesser albums. Quite the contrary! This is simply beautiful music! Essential!\"\nThey are also, quite often, very danceable, and not without \"full-blown freakouts,\" as evidenced on \"I'll Wait for You\" from Strange Celestial Road (which originated at the Sleeping Beauty sessions).\nON JUPITER, issued on Sun Ra's Saturn label (cat #101679), was comprised of three tracks from two sessions at NYC's Variety Recording Studio, one in mid- to late-May 1979, the other on October 16, 1979.\nTypical of Ra during the '70s and '80s, he didn't waste time dallying between recording and commercial release. Ra was incapable of artistically selling out, but that didn't prevent him from redefining the phrase \"making a quick buck.\" During this period, LPs were pressed based on immediate economic need—and often timed to coincide with tours which required an immediate cash infusion. These albums would be pressed in limited quantities without printed covers, with minimal or no information on the labels, absent personnel credits, and often without track and album titles. Sometimes covers were hand-designed by the band (this digital release's \"cover\" was one such artifact, sans typography).\nMany of these small press runs—which were estimated to number from 100 to 300—were sold for cash to Rounder Distribution, with copies set aside for the band to sell at concerts and club gigs. Glenn Jones, who coordinated Ra's distribution deal with Rounder, would solicit from Ra—and, if the artist wasn't available, occasionally have to speculate about—album and track titles. This info would be Xeroxed on rectangular sheets of colored paper and taped to the back of the outer cardboard sleeve. Copies which did not circulate through Rounder might not have these sheets; consequently, Saturn albums from this period were often known by two (or even three) different titles, depending on what was scribbled on the label of a particular customer's copy. The album On Jupiter has occasionally been called Seductive Fantasy. Both titles appear on the album, the former as track 1 on side A, and the latter as the entirety of side B.\nAs chronicled in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed., 2000), by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent: \"[Drummer] Samarai Celestial pointed out that 'UFO' was recorded before he joined the band in July 1979, whereas [tracks 1 and 3] came from a later session. Personnel from [Hartmut] Geerken’s discography with corrections by Samarai and [Campbell].\"\nA bonus track is included on this digital edition: an early, wordless live rendition of \"UFO\" performed and recorded on Halloween, 1978, at Grendel's Lair, a Philadelphia club that occasionally hosted Ra and his entourage. The work was found on a tape by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive. By the time the title was recorded at Variety during the On Jupiter session, lyrics existed and had already been modified. According to Earthly Recordings, the work was performed on May 5, 1979, at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, and \"the vocal on that version was somewhat different from the vocal on [the] studio recording and subsequent concert performances.\" According to the book, Ra \"told a member of the audience that he had 'prepared a practice piece' for the [concert]. The only previously unperformed piece [heard on an existing tape of the concert] was 'UFO'.\" However, based on the Grendel's Lair tape (which was unknown at the time Earthly Recordings was published), we now know that \"UFO\" had, in fact, been previously performed, albeit sans lyrics.\n— I.C.\nNote: On Jupiter has long been available from Art Yard, whose license terminated at the end of 2020. Our 2021 edition is a new remastering from alternate sources. The bonus track and the above annotation are new to this reissue.",

            "about": "Other Planes of There (recorded 1964, released 1966) could be mistaken for an artifact of the \"free jazz\" movement that was gaining a foothold in New York during the early 1960s. Artists like Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler, and Ornette Coleman were advancing the frontiers of jazz in a way that excited many, while alienating an equal number. Audiences were often perplexed—sometimes infuriated—at the brutality, lack of traditional structure, and unpredictability of the new music. Pioneering bebop drummer Max Roach, after witnessing a performance by Coleman at the Five Spot jazz roost, followed the saxophonist off-stage and punched him in the mouth. Trumpeter Roy Eldridge thought Coleman was \"jiving, putting everybody on.\" Yet in retrospect there's no denying the new music's historic impact on jazz evolution.\nSun Ra shared stages, dressing rooms, and newsprint with these contemporaries. His music often sparked similar reactions—positive and negative. Yet despite stylistic similarities between Sun Ra and the above mavericks—composing and performing works which were irregular, asymmetrical, and seemed to lack a center—Sunny rejected the \"free\" label. \"I don't play free music, because there is no freedom in the universe,\" he told an interviewer in 1970. \"If you were to be free you could just play no matter what and it doesn't come back to you. But you see, it always does come back to you. That's why I warn my musicians: be careful what you play … every note, every beat, be aware that it comes back to you. And if you play something you yourself don't understand, then that's bad for you and for the people too.\"\nLike many Sun Ra albums, Other Planes of There offers a musical portrait of where Sun Ra and his Arkestral entourage find themselves during a given period. Exposed to new ideas on a daily basis, challenged to excel by competitors on the downtown scene, Sun Ra might not have considered his music \"free,\" but he benefited from a community which respected and encouraged musical free-thinking. This support allowed him to experiment and grow, to challenge his audience, and to risk rejection if listeners and critics didn't like (or couldn't understand) each progressive musical mutation.\nRehearsing and recording at the Choreographer's Workshop gave ample time to develop ideas without a nudgy A&R exec watching the clock or chiseling the budget. This self-controlled environment (and the usual ad hoc recording quality) marks Other Planes. The arrangements breathe, they evolve unhurriedly, and there's much open space. This is music by process. In contrast to the muscularity of free jazz, Sun Ra's leader-directed improvisations have an orchestrated feel, a pace that juxtaposes the pastoral with sporadic bursts of frenzy and much rhythmic variety. Sunny's love of percussion permeates these sessions. The works proceed with great deliberation, but they move. That's no accident. \"No matter how far out my music may be,\" Sun Ra once explained, \"you can always dance to it.\"\n– I.C.",

The tracks were issued on a double LP in '78.\nAccording to notes in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent), \"Sun Ra frequently used his Crumar keyboard to program repeated lines and 'drum' sequences throughout the January 1978 sessions in Italy.\" These sessions also produced a companion double album, \"New Steps,\" with the identical personnel.",

            "about": "A fabulous, previously unreleased live set recorded during a late 1983 European tour by Sun Ra and His Arkestra. The exact date and venue are unknown, although Paris has been identified as the city.\nIn the 1980s Ra sustained a rigorous US and overseas performance schedule. Audiences were growing, especially in Europe, and shows were becoming more extravagant and theatrical.\nDuring this period, the Arkestra's repertoire began to feature Ra originals mixed with a greater proportion of Tin Pan Alley standards. These vintage titles held great significance to Sunny; they were popular when he was growing up and making his initial forays into composing and arranging. These famous tunes served as the building blocks for young Herman \"Sunny\" Blount in the 1930s and '40s, and decades later they became recurring entries on set-lists.\nBased on other Arkestra gigs in Europe around this time, the personnel likely consisted of:\nSun Ra: piano, keyboard, vocals\nJune Tyson: vocals\nMarshall Allen: kora, flute, alto sax, percussion\nJohn Gilmore: tenor sax, clarinet, timb, vocals\nEloe Omoe: contra-alto clarinet, bass clarinet, alto sax, percussion\nDanny Ray Thompson: baritone sax,flute, percussion\nJames Jacson: bassoon, Infinity-drums, flute\nRonnie Brown: trumpet, flugelhorn\nKwame Hadi: trumpet\nTyrone Hill: trombone\nJames Glass: electric guitar\nRollo Radford: electric bass\nClifford Jarvis: drums\nMarvin “Boogaloo” Smith: drums\nChris Henderson: drums\nAtakatune: conga",

            "about": "PATHWAYS TO UNKNOWN WORLDS\nNOTE: Also available on LP and CD at  modernharmonic.com\nPathways to Unknown Worlds was originally issued on LP in 1975 as part of Sun Ra's ill-fated and short-lived ABC/Impulse! Records partnership. ABC offered an ambitious deal that promised dozens of remastered editions of Sun Ra's Saturn back catalog along with a slew of new titles. The launch fizzled shortly after liftoff, but not before introducing two vital albums to the Ra catalog: Astro Black and Pathways. (Astro Black was reissued in all formats by Modern Harmonic in 2018.)\nRa’s original Pathways liner notes expressed his disdain for the past and his vision of the future. But the future here rendered by Ra seems more dystopian than utopian. Imagine this album as an aural Science Fiction novel, analogous to the contemporaneous writings of Philip K. Dick, Harlan Ellison, Samuel R. Delany, and others who dwelled in unknown worlds where confusion and chaos often reign. A cybernetical soundscape for time travel through an inscrutable cosmos.\nOur travelogue opens with “Pathways To Unknown Worlds,\" as bass clarinet (Eloe Omoe), baritone sax (Danny Ray Thompson), and oboe (Ra mainstay Marshall Allen) slither about while percussion refracts below. Ra enters quietly, adding bell-toned sounds from a Yamaha YC-45D combo organ. This model, introduced in 1972, featured a pitch-bend ribbon controller which allowed the player, with a slide of the finger, to produce theremin or synthesizer sounds. The track also features Akh Tal Ebah on Space Dimension Mellophone (a mellophone with a contrabassoon reed) and trumpeter Kwame Hadi.\nBassist Ronnie Boykins provides the backbone for this track, improvising solo lines built around the keynote. The ensemble responds chaotically until Boykins’ bowed bass shrieks to a climax, his microphone collapsing and falling to the floor.\nThe complete version of “Extension Out” debuts here, including the opening five and a half minutes that were omitted from the 1975 LP. A 2000 CD reissue on Evidence included this section as a separate “Untitled” track, which faded out. The master tape used here contains the uninterrupted thirteen-minute performance. Danny Davis joins Marshall Allen in the opening salvo for a threatening alto sax duel, with Omoe’s bass clarinet and Ebah's trumpet agitating over multiple percussionists. Clifford Jarvis, one of the most powerful drummers ever to perform with the Arkestra, is the rhythmic bedrock on each track.\nThe LP closes with “Cosmo-Media,” in which Ra and Boykins lead off with intergalactic conversation. Tenor sax stalwart John Gilmore finally gets a wild showcase, as Hadi’s torrid trumpet flourishes. The work draws to a meditative close as Ra’s synth and Boykins’ bass flutter off to unknown worlds.\nThis Modern Harmonic edition has been remastered from the four-track session reel. The 1975 Impulse! LP was formatted as “Quad Compatible”—short for \"quadraphonic\"—which you could enjoy if you had four speakers, a custom quad cartridge/stylus, and a decoder integrated into your ’70s hi-fi. At the time, quad was \"The Future of Sound.\" The Future flopped, as the music industry soon regressed to stereo—one channel for each ear.\nAn additional treat was discovered on the sessions reels: the brief yet compelling “View From A Mountain Top.” The track opens with a “Discipline”-styled scored eight-bar horn melody before Omoe and Gilmore skulk over Ra’s monotone organ. The track fades out quickly, implying there may be more on another as-yet unfound tape.\nThe two closing tracks on this remastered edition were previously released as Side B on the Of Mythic Worlds LP, issued in 1980 on the Philly Jazz label. The source of these tracks was uncertain, and Ra offered no clues. Decades later, these tracks were authoritatively determined to have originated at the Pathways sessions. The aptly titled “Intrinsic Energies” features Boykins propelling the track with a singular rhythmic charge over Ra’s organ patches, while Gilmore, followed by Allen, wails assertively throughout the central passages.\nThe supersonic dance party continues with “Of Mythic Worlds,” again driven by Boykins and a small army of percussionists. Gilmore’s somewhat placid entrance turns into a furious caterwaul, abetted by Allen, with Thompson on Neptunian Libflecto (a bassoon with a French Horn or saxophone mouthpiece), while Ra’s organ caroms about.\nRecorded at Variety Recording Studios, New York City in early 1973, Pathways was the final Arkestra release from ABC/Impulse!. Ra’s ten ABC albums (eight reissues and two premieres) were dumped in cutout bins during the late ‘70s, while 15 contracted albums—nine Saturn reissues and six new titles—were canceled. Since 2000, five of those six have been issued, including The Cymbals/Symbols Sessions [MH-8083] and Crystal Spears [MH-8082] on Modern Harmonic. Despite this setback, Sun Ra—an artist who looked toward the future while occasionally reimagining his past—continued forging pathways to new and unknown worlds for two more decades.\n- Brother Cleve\n[This is an abridged and adapted version of the liner notes from the Modern Harmonic LP/CD release]",

            "about": "\"A lot of people say that I'm just playing around, but it's not like that. I know music from head to tail, I know all the laws of music, I was reared up playing classics and I went to college and studied music for teacher's training, so I KNOW music. But I'm just following my own way, and I know what I'm doing.\" — Sun Ra, 1966\nThis collection of recordings, drawn from several sources, are somewhat stylistically unified. The personnel, arrangements, audio quality, and research indicate these recordings were made at concert locations in and around New York, ca. 1966. They might have originated from a series of college tours Sun Ra undertook with the Arkestra in upstate New York, while the band was living and largely working in New York City.\nIn the mid-1960s, Sun Ra's commercial recordings and performances were reflecting new musical directions, many representing extreme departures from his Chicago (1956–1960) and early New York (1961–1963) approaches to jazz. Such albums as Other Planes of There (1964), The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra (volumes 1 & 2; 1965), The Magic City (1965), Strange Strings (1966), and Atlantis (1967) pushed beyond the conventions of structured, beat-driven jazz to challenging frontiers. To many ears, they were no longer \"inside\" jazz at all. Rather, they were \"outside\"—groundbreaking musical forms that transcended categories. In jazz circles, this side of Ra sparked controversy, gaining him many allies, while losing others.\nThe 1966 recordings in this set, however, are largely \"inside,\" and demonstrate that during this period Ra didn't abandon his jazz roots (in fact, he never did). These titles, many dating from his Chicago and early New York years, represent an updating of Sun Ra's early catalog (with some new titles). The playing is loose, but structured, and Sun Ra's featured soloists get ample opportunities to stretch out. Call it \"harder bop.\"\nIn the ballad-like “The Wind Speaks,” the opening and closing themes echo the melody of “Somebody Else’s World,” an early 1970s composition which originated in the late 1950s as “Somebody Else’s Idea.” This Third Stream arrangement features a haunting duet between Ra on Clavioline and Ronnie Boykins on bowed bass. \"State Street,\" first recorded in 1960 and rarely performed, harkens back to one of Ra's earliest musical gigs in Chicago, the Club DeLisa, where as Herman \"Sonny\" Blount he played piano for the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra in the late 1940s. A short take of \"We Travel the Spaceways\" closes the album; during the tour this title was often performed as an abbreviated coda.\nAs with any Sun Ra recordings, imperfections abound. The mixes are less than perfectly balanced, there's occasional distortion and missed performance cues, and soloists are not always near the mic. But as we've often pointed out, Sun Ra never recorded in a Dave Brubeck studio with a Miles Davis budget. This is \"Garage Jazz.\"\nBut it is JAZZ. For your delectation.\n–I.C.",

            "about": "Sun Ra loved the joyous music from Walt Disney's animated films. He did so without irony. He performed these songs with his legendary Arkestra over many years, in many venues, and each performance was unique. At one 1989 concert in SF, he actually called his band \"Sun Ra and his Disney Odyssey Adventure Arkestra.\"\nThis album presents a small sample of Sun Ra exploring the Disneysphere. All tracks but one were recorded at concerts and club dates. With the exception of \"Marching Pink Elephants,\" recorded at Variety Studios for producer Hal Willner's 1988 Disney tribute album STAY AWAKE, Ra never recorded studio versions of Disney repertoire.\nThe songs are from such classics as Peter Pan, Babes in Toyland, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White & the Seven Dwarfs, Dumbo, Mary Poppins, and Song of the South. There are countless ad hoc recordings of Ra performing Disney tunes, but the audio quality is often dodgy, since these were recorded by fans. For this collection, we curated the best professional-quality recordings of Ra performing Disney.\nThis album was issued on LP and CD on Modern Harmonic, in July 2024. (The first LP pressing was issued for Record Store Day, April 2024.) Tracks 1 thru 9 had been previously unissued. This Bandcamp digital edition contains three bonus tracks (11, 12, 13), all of which have been previously released.\nTracks 1, 2, 7, 8 recorded at the 9:30 Club, Washington DC, 1989\nTracks 3, 5, 10, 11 recorded in Virginia, 1988\nTrack 4 recorded in Zurich, Switzerland, 1987\nTrack 6 recorded at Regatta Bar, 1990\nTrack 9 recorded at Stache's, 1985\nTrack 12 recorded Variety Recording Studios, NYC, 1988\nTrack 13 recorded at Jazzatelier, Ulrichsberg, Austria, 1989",

            "about": "The Pleiades are an open star cluster in the constellation Taurus. One of the nearest such clusters to Earth, the Seven Sisters (as they're also known) comprise middle-aged, hot B-type stars which can be viewed by Earthlings in the night sky without a telescope. The nine brightest stars of the cluster are named for the Seven Sisters of Greek mythology and their parents.\n\"Pleiades\" is also one of the earliest existing Sun Ra compositions, first recorded on a home piano demo by 34-year-old Herman \"Sonny\" Blount in his sweltering South Side Chicago apartment in August 1948. Blount had moved to the Windy City in 1946 and began musical dues-paying that found him writing arrangements for sundowning big bands and wild R&B shouters, fronting small combos in dancehalls and dives, and making a local name for himself as an ambitious composer/arranger-for-hire. That vintage demo, recorded in solitude and redolent with sandpapery surface noise, opens this album.\nWe then segue ahead 42 years, to the twilight of Sun Ra's long and storied career. At age 76, when many of his contemporaries were in nursing homes or under headstones, Ra embarked on six visits to Europe, several comprising multiple bookings in different countries. (This rigorous travel schedule allegedly contributed to his suffering a stroke later that year.) Among dozens of dates in celebrated clubs and concert halls, Ra led his Arkestra in a \"Jazz Symphonique\" at the Théâtre-Carré Saint-Vincent, Orléans, France, on October 27, 1990. Other than renditions of two Swing Era chestnuts, \"Blue Lou\" and \"Frisco Fog,\" it was an all-Ra repertoire.\nThe opening work was the ancient \"Pleiades.\"\nThe pairing of Ra's raucous Arkestra with an elegant classical ensemble, while unusual, would come as no surprise to those who followed Sun Ra's trailblazing career. To Ra, nothing was unthinkable. Across 40+ years of studio recording and public performance, Ra offered everything except consistency and predictability.\nRa discographer Christopher Trent, co-author (with Robert L. Campbell) of The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, recalled: \"My impression is that for the Pleiades gig, a selection of classical musicians were hired rather than a complete orchestra.\" Ra biographer John Szwed obtained information about the concert directly from Arkestra trumpeter Jothan Callins, who had played a larger-than-usual role on the date. As recounted by Szwed in Space is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra:\n“The Théâtre-Carré Saint-Vincent event in Orléans, France, was billed as a ‘Jazz Symphonique’ concert, and Sun Ra had nineteen classical musicians made available to him to add to the sixteen musicians he was bringing, which already included two violins and a cello. He threw himself into the project and bought a computer to help him produce the instruments’ parts. But once they reached Paris, Sun Ra confided to Jothan Callins that he didn’t have the arrangements ready for the larger ensemble. And though he didn’t ask for help, he seemed distraught, his hands shaking. So for the next fifty hours Callins worked with Sun Ra on the parts, transcribing and Xeroxing day and night, even adding his own composition, ‘Alabama,’ to the list, and then when the night of the performance came, Callins conducted the Arkestra for Sonny. ‘When I finished he thanked me for it,’ said Callins. ‘It was the first time I’d ever heard him thank anyone for anything.’”\nThe concert was apparently captured only on DAT (digital audio tape, a then-high tech, but now obsolete compact cartridge format). While the recording is generally crisp with dense ambience, the microphone placement sounds ad hoc and many instruments are heard only as distant echoes, especially horns and occasionally the piano. Three admittedly speculative scenarios: 1) considering the large number of musicians involved, perhaps the stage crew ran short of mics; 2) players shifted positions throughout the performance; and/or 3) microphones were repositioned throughout the performance. (In at least one instance, a sax solo begins solidly, then suddenly dips precipitously in volume as if the player had crossed the stage or the mic was removed—or malfunctioned. Talvin Singh's tabla are close-miked on some tracks, more distant on others.)\nThis rare concert was issued in the UK on a 2-CD set entitled Pleiades, on the Leo label in 1993. However, that album's audio sounds like a direct transfer from a source DAT with no attempt at sonic adjustments. Consequently, the instruments and channels are out of balance, and volume levels are erratic. The violins, drums, and tabla are well-represented, often at the expense of other instruments and soloists. In ensemble passages the horns generate enough collective power to blast through, but some soloists are exiled to the sonic shadows. The tabla (which sporadically seem to have been placed directly near a mic, or vice-versa) are often intrusively loud, and the bass drum accents explode above the limits of comfort.\nBack in 1993, digital audio editing was a relatively young technology, and the more sophisticated systems were largely housed in professional studios. Software, plugins, waveform editors, and sonic juicers were primitive compared to what can be accomplished today at home on a laptop. Consequently, this 2018 digital edition offers a remarkable upgrade to that 1993 CD. Our version offers a better mix—the best that can be accomplished from a seemingly haphazard stereo capture with no isolated stems.\nMichael D. Anderson, of the Sun Ra Music Archive, supplied flat transfers from two DATs of the full concert. (Each was 60 minutes, with the end of tape one overlapping with the beginning of tape two, indicating two machines were used; the mix was identical to the Leo CD.) We went in passage by passage and removed transient noises, adjusted volume levels, and made the atmosphere slightly more vibrant. Thankfully, it's possible to boost the volume of imbalanced channels because, unlike analog tape, DATs were virtually hiss-free.\nThe tabla slaps and kick drum blasts have been moderated (though nothing was hammered down; they were meticulously lowered hit-by-hit). The kick still has power but doesn't rattle the speakers; the tabla remain prominent—they are crisp and cut through. The playing is spectacular, and they're a crucial part of these arrangements (also we love percussion!). However, there are other instruments behind the tabla, and too much suppression would cause signal loss in those instruments.\nThere's a lot of onstage \"rustling\"—players moving stuff around, turning pages in the score, coughing, positioning themselves to play. We minimized such artifacts where intrusive (e.g., during piano solos), but left plenty of such \"noise\" because that's Ra and it provides a sense of space.\nAudience presence has been minimized; where tracks begin and end cleanly, applause has been eliminated. Where intros or endings overlapped with applause, all music was retained and applause was faded in or out respectively. This is partly a necessity in the age of digital music, where tracks can be purchased separately and/or listened to out of context.\nSome titles were inaccurate on the Leo CD. Track 2, listed as \"Mythic 1,\" is in fact \"Planet Earth Day.\" CD track 7, listed as \"Planet Earth Day,\" was actually a work that Ra alternately titled \"Carefree\" or \"Egyptian Fantasy.\" Two tracks not included on the Leo CD have been restored to their sequence in the concert: \"Frisco Fog\" and a rousing concert-closing reprise of \"Planet Earth Day.\" (\"Blue Lou,\" heard on the CD, had to be jettisoned from this digital edition because the instrument mix was hopelessly beyond repair. It's a showpiece for Gilmore but after he begins a rousing solo, his volume level drops precipitously as if his mic cuts out, and it remains that way for the balance of the track, which is largely an aggressive battalion of drums and percussion with most other instruments buried in the mix. Did we mention we love percussion?) In addition, track 3 on the CD, \"Friendly Galaxy,\" actually consisted of two works—\"Galaxy\" was followed by a separate four-and-a-half minute work that was not indexed or listed in the CD sequence. Anderson claims the unidentified work is titled \"Disciplined One.\" Trent adds: \"It’s a separate piece, a conducted improvisation with Sun Ra standing in front of the band, signaling for various ensembles and solos. I don’t think there’s any written composition in there. It's the kind of piece Ra would often initiate after the band arrived onstage at the start of a set, but he would also use such pieces to punctuate sequences of composed music.\"\n\"'Mythic 2' is a Sun Ra composition without a real/original title,\" said Trent. \"The title was added by Leo as a placeholder. It’s the only recording on which I have ever heard this composition as far as I remember.\"\nThe Callins original, \"Alabama,\" mentioned by Szwed, is absent from the tapes and there is no indication it was performed.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "Featuring what may be his only recordings on the Prophet keyboard, these once lost performances expand the omniverse of Sun Ra across a stellar set of lengthy cuts. These works were recorded in a single day and are making their terrestrial debut.\nWhat happens when a Prophet meets a Prophet? The answer lies within these grooves.\nAmid the hundreds of recordings issued by Sun Ra and his Arkestra under their various guises, the majority were recorded in concert or in makeshift studios, such as their early 1960s set-up at NYC's Choreographer's Workshop. Beyond those, roughly 22 albums were recorded professionally at Variety Recording Studio in New York's Times Square. However, on August 25, 1986, Ra and cohorts entered Mission Control, a state-of-the-art 24-track studio north of Boston, which was teeming with electronic keyboards and otherworldly sound generators. Nestled within that arsenal was a brand-new digital ultra keyboard — the Prophet VS (\"Vector Synthesizer\").\nOf all the keyboards Ra played throughout his half-century career, the Prophet was one of the most sophisticated. There's no evidence that he had played either of the instrument's earlier incarnations, the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 and Prophet-10. Created using microprocessors, a then-new technological advance, under the auspices of engineer Dave Smith in 1978, the Prophet-5 revolutionized electronic music as the first polyphonic and, most importantly, programmable synthesizer. Ra was intrigued by the Prophet (surely by the instrument as well as by the name), and gave the instrument a solid workout prior to a full Arkestra recording session later that day.\nThese performances originated from previously unreleased 1986 tapes recorded by preserved by Bill Sebastian as part of his Outer Space Visual Communicator (OVC) project. Irwin Chusid discovered the existence of the tapes and arranged thru Sebastian to have them digitally transferred and mixed by myself and our buddy Sean Slade.\nIt was a joy and a thrill to be sitting at the console hearing this music for the first time, especially with my fingers on the faders and knobs of the mixing desk. We watched the oxide fly off the 2\" tapes during playback, making this our one chance to digitize before they disintegrated into dust. Welcome to the new Sun Ra album …. 35+ years after it was recorded. The Omniverse has expanded once again.\n— Brother Cleve (1955 - 2022)\nNOTE: This album is also available on LP and CD from Modern Harmonic.",

            "about": "NOTE: This is a 2022 remaster of RA TO THE RESCUE, which is also available from Modern Harmonic on LP and CD. The following liner notes are adapted from our 2015 digital release of the original Saturn album. The new cover art was adapted by Jon Hunt from a handmade, one-off Saturn cover.\n===\nMany albums Sun Ra released on his Saturn label seem to have been programmed in random shuffle; hybrid pressings turn up which couple tracks from unrelated sessions, sometimes in clashing styles, often under new album titles. To the Ra enthusiast, this is not a bug—it's a feature. Each time the band went on tour (which was often), they needed product to sell at concerts. Rather than re-press existing albums, Ra had a penchant for reconstituting the catalog with fresh material, even if it was juxtaposed with previously issued material.\nRa to the Rescue was pressed in limited quantities in 1983, but several of its tracks subsequently were reissued with other tracks on the albums (commonly referred to as) When Spaceships Appear, Cosmo-Party Blues, Somewhere There, and Children of the Sun. Those album \"titles\" are in many cases simply titles of the first track on a particular side (these were scribbled in pen on otherwise blank labels). To complicate matters, many tracks were retitled for reasons that shall forever remain inscrutable.\nThe tracks on Ra to the Rescue were recorded at several locations over several years. Some were recorded at New York's Squat Theater, founded by Hungarian political dissidents and based in a cramped storefront at 256 West 23rd Street. Besides music, Squat was known for dramatic productions (from Chekhov to conceptual absurdism), which were staged in the theater's window overlooking the Manhattan sidewalk. From 1979 to 1982 the Arkestra gigged regularly at Squat; an unknown number of performances were recorded, a few released commercially. The Squat archives (at  SquatTheatre.com)  claim that Ra debuted there in August 1979 and performed on the premises 47 times, \"to become our most frequent guest.\" The chronicle explains that \"the fit between the Arkestra and the Squat Theatre was a natural one, as both were in essence creative communes.\" (Other recordings from Squat can be heard on our digital release Voice of the Eternal Tomorrow.)\nThe origins of the remaining tracks on Ra to the Rescue are speculative. The Earthling Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed.) calls them \"odds and ends from various [1984 or 1985] concerts taped by Arkestra members.\" Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive says they were recorded in 1984 by director Frank Cassenti for his documentary Mystery, Mr. Ra, at two Paris concerts: one at the Paris Jazz Festival, the other at the New Morning club. Many tracks in the documentary are fragments. The two titles included on this album which are heard in the film are different recordings. Anderson says \"Mystery, Mr. Ra\" was recorded at the festival and intended for release by Sun Ra, but was shelved.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Secrets of the Sun is one of many Sun Ra albums which originated from sessions at the Choreographer's Workshop, a West 51st Street venue which served as the Arkestra's rehearsal space from roughly 1962 to 1965. The band rehearsed there endlessly, and more often than not an open-reel tape deck was running. These sessions produced tracks which (without organizing logic) achieved first commercial release on Saturn LPs throughout the 1960s and '70s. (Many unreleased tracks are first appearing on these post-2014 \"Sun-tennial\" digital remasters.)\nSecrets of the Sun was recorded in 1962, but didn't appear on Saturn vinyl until '65. Per what had long been the bandleader's trademark, many titles point to destinations beyond Earth's stratosphere, while paradoxically echoing rhythms and forms inspired by Africa. And in what was a recurring motif of the Choreographer's milieu, the recordings themselves have a raw quality, replete with warehouse acoustics, distortion, erratic mic proximity, and a limited frequency spectrum. It's garage jazz. As on many of the Workshop sessions, drummer Tommy Hunter served as recording engineer, and his proto-psychedelic reverb saturates a few of these performances.\nThe album features an arsenal of percussion, often in the hands of Arkestra horn players, reinforced by the thumping bass of Ronnie Boykins. Sun Ra's developing Afrocentric consciousness inspired many of these relentlessly thunderous grooves. Despite the sustained pounding, there is a sparseness to most arrangements, fewer instruments in the mix, with piano often serving as counterpoint to the rhythmic clatter. It's less an orchestra than an expanded combo. There are few \"genre\" works on Secrets, and much less of what was conventionally considered \"jazz\" during Sunny's Chicago roost. New York, the artist's recently adopted hometown, was serving to liberate the composer's imagination.\nSecrets marked the debut (on \"Solar Differentials\") of idiosyncratic vocalist Art Jenkins, who thereafter appeared sporadically on Saturn albums (and beyond) in cameo roles. As recounted in John Szwed's bio Space is the Place, Jenkins auditioned for Sun Ra as an R&B singer, but the bandleader rejected him because he wanted a singer who could achieve the \"impossible.\" \"The possible has been tried and failed,\" Sunny told Jenkins. \"Now I want to try the impossible.\" Jenkins eventually chanced upon the technique of singing into a backwards ram's horn, creating a human wah-wah. \"Now that's impossible,\" said Ra, and Jenkins got the gig as \"space vocalist.\" Calvin Newborn's electric guitar on the opening number is a fresh sound; the band rarely worked with guitarists during this period. Several of these tracks — \"Friendly Galaxy\" and \"Love in Outer Space\" — became concert staples in years ahead.\nThis remastered edition contains the premiere release of the full \"Reflects Motion\" three-part suite, and one previously unreleased track from the session tapes, \"Project Black Mass.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "A number of sessions recorded by Sun Ra from 1978 to 1980—issued on the albums Lanquidity, On Jupiter, and Sleeping Beauty—reflect the influence on Ra of commercial musical and production trends of the mid- and late-1970s, especially heavy, studio-enhanced dance floor grooves (traceable from soul and funk to disco), and atmospheric New Age \"dream\" pieces. But Ra neither surrendered to nor fully embraced these styles—he simply added these techniques to his toolkit, always stretching beyond the genres. The only aspect that eluded him was commercial success.\nSleeping Beauty (Saturn 79) was recorded in New York in June 1979 and released later that year. Like many Sun Ra albums from the 1970s and '80s, it was pressed in a limited (and unknown) quantity, packaged with generic (albeit often hand-decorated) sleeves, and distributed by Rounder and sold at concerts. Also like many releases of the period, it was known by a second title — Door of the Cosmos. Those alternate titles derived from two of the album's three tracks. Oddly, \"Sleeping Beauty\" had an alternate title — \"Black Beauty,\" which was printed on some labels (and typed on others). Affirming that this release should be filed under \"Alternative,\" the band was identified as \"Sun Ra and His Arkestra\" on most labels and as \"Sun Ra Omniverse Jet Set Arkestra\" on at least one extant sleeve.\nThree additional tracks were recorded at the June '79 session: \"Celestial Road,\" \"Say,\" and \"I'll Wait for You.\" Those tracks were licensed to Rounder Records, who issued them on the LP Strange Celestial Road (Rounder 3035) in 1982. (Note: The Rounder label and Rounder Distribution were related companies, but separate operations. Saturn LPs were distributed by Rounder, but were not released by Rounder. However, there were, in time, three Sun Ra albums issued on Rounder—Strange Celestial Road, Somewhere Else, and Sun Ra Sextet at the Village Vanguard—but none of the three had been previously issued on Saturn.)\nArt Yard released an authorized edition of Sleeping Beauty on CD in 2010.

            "about": "Sun Ra presented quite a few solo piano shows between 1977 and 1980 in the US and Europe, and several have been issued commercially. From a solo keyboard standpoint, it was one of Sunny's most prolific periods. At each gig he customarily offered three categories of works: 1) Tin Pan Alley standards he had revered since his pre-Chicago days (e.g. \"Over the Rainbow,\" \"Don't Blame Me,\" and \"Honeysuckle Rose\"); 2) Ra originals, though he drew from a limited selection of his voluminous catalog (\"Love in Outer Space\" seemed obligatory); and 3) improvisations, perhaps a blues, which sometimes included stray riffs from categories 1 and 2.\nAccording to Michael D. Anderson, of the Sun Ra Music Archive, who provided the transfer from a cassette recorded on-the-spot (it's an excellent audio capture), this performance took place at a Minnesota club in 1978. The specific location and date are unknown. It did not take place in Minneapolis, because Sun Ra's first visit to the Twin Cities was reportedly on October 20, 1980, at the Walker Art Center (with the Arkestra).\n[2022 UPDATE: Ra fan Curt McNamara informs us the show took place in April 1978 at the Whole Coffeehouse, at the University of Minnesota.]\nThe recordings on this set feature a piano with lots of clackety-clack action and random environmental noise. This could be due to ad hoc mic placement, the condition of the piano, and/or human motion. Someone near the mic with a bad cough provides sporadic respiratory accompaniment. On the cassette there is applause between takes, but it has been edited out to showcase the music without audience reaction, which we feel intrudes on the intimacy of private listening.\nThe titles of the unknown works in this set were applied by Anderson to differentiate them from other untitled Ra works and for purposes of copyright registration. Occasionally there's a hint of a familiar melody, but Ra quickly digresses. For instance, Ra discographer Christopher Trent reviewed the set and commented, \"On track five he almost launches into 'We Travel The Spaceways' at the start, but quickly shoots off elsewhere. I don’t think this fleeting reference determines the piece, On live recordings, he’s often heard hinting at one composition in an intro before zeroing in on another. I saw him doing this and wrong-footing the Arkestra a couple of times—they had to search through their sheet music as the piano intro implied one standard, then another. Probably all to do with Ra's habit of deciding what piece to play next on the spur of the moment.\"\nBesides the piano excursions, the set includes three synth works which feature Sunny on his Crumar Mainman (or Orchestrator), an ephemeral keyboard curiosity that never achieved prominence during its brief—and somewhat mysterious—existence. Invented in 1977 by the Italian company Crumar (the name is a portmanteau of founders Mario Crucianelli and F. Marchetti), it was known in Europe as the Crumar Multiman-S and was an early polyphonic synth, capable of a variety of sounds and effects, including programmed percussion patterns. Some have speculated that Ra's model—which he acquired during a visit to Italy in early 1978—was one of less than a dozen manufactured prototypes, and that the product was abandoned and never marketed. Unfortunately, there is little information available online about it.\nMusician and keyboard historian (and Ra scholar) Brother Cleve says, \"It was pretty much a glorified string ensemble that included brass, bass, and percussion options. You could also add fuzz tones. On this Minnesota date, Sunny is using the volume pedal for a number of effects. The Crumar purportedly could also replicate a piano, but on the non-synth tracks here he's playing an upright.\"\nThe Crumar achieved recognition among Ra fans because there are several iconic photos of Ra playing the instrument, and it was featured on a limited but pivotal series of recordings. Immediately after acquiring the device, Ra employed it during two January quartet sessions in Rome, issued on the Horo label as NEW STEPS and OTHER VOICES, OTHER BLUES. There is no bassist on either session (or on live dates in Italy that same month), so Ra used the Crumar's bass feature as a stand-in. Campbell and Trent's 'The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra' notes, \"Ra frequently used his Crumar keyboard to program repeated lines and 'drum' sequences throughout the January 1978 sessions in Italy. These can be heard on live material like DISCO 3000 [recorded the same month in Italy] as well as on studio tracks.\" The Crumar was a favorite of Ra during 1978, also being used on LANQUIDITY and on various other documented live dates. However, after that year, it disappears from Ra's chronology—and the rest is lost history.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "This set of Sun Ra solo piano works was performed and broadcast at WKCR Radio, on July 8, 1977. WKCR, the largely student-run station of Columbia University, has a decades-long tradition of fine jazz programming. During Sun Ra's career, he made so many appearances at the station that he probably had a front door key. Sometimes he performed (with or without members of the Arkestra), other times he would present rare and unreleased recordings. This solo piano set was rebroadcast several times over the years, and is documented in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, 2nd ed., 2000), entry #252.\nThe nine tracks feature three standards, two titled Ra originals, and four impromptu untitled pieces. To distinguish the unnamed works from countless other untitled Ra performance works (and for purposes of publishing registration), we have assigned titles based on Rodger Coleman's 2013 review of this set in his comprehensive Sun Ra Sundays blog series. The unnamed works are now designated \"Bluesy Improvisation,\" \"Another Improv Blues,\" \"Agitated Ostinato in Seven,\" and \"Two-Chord Vamp.\"\nThere were very few solo piano albums issued by Ra during his lifetime. On his own Saturn label, there were two volumes entitled Monorails and Satellites issued in the late 1960s (a third volume was posthumously discovered and issued with a 2019 reissue of volumes 1 and 2). Aurora Borealis, recorded in 1980, was issued in 1981. Two solo piano albums (one studio, one live) were issued on Paul Bley's Improvising Artists label in 1977-78.\nThere is a historic trajectory. In the mid-1960s Ra had begun playing more electronic keyboards in concerts, on club dates, and in the studio. For a decade his work was dominated by Minimoog, Rocksichord, Crumar Mainman, Clavioline, Farfisa, Hohner Clavinet, and other electronic instruments—with a de-emphasis on piano. In fact, after Ra moved from New York to Philadelphia around 1968, he no longer had a piano in his house.\nHowever, in addition to Aurora Borealis and the two Improvising Artists releases, a number of recordings of late 1970s solo piano gigs have posthumously emerged, reflecting a return by Ra in this period to acoustic piano (his original instrument). There's a date recorded in Venice in 1977 (issued on CD on the Leo imprint and reissued digitally on our Enterplanetary Koncepts label), and a set of undetermined origin recorded at a Minnesota club around 1978 (slated for digital release). Adding this WKCR session to the catalog reinforces the impression that during the late 1970s, Ra occasionally seemed inclined to take a break from performing and recording with the Arkestra to go it alone, often on acoustic piano.\nThat said, Arkestra mainstays John Gilmore and June Tyson join in (somewhat off-mic) accompanying Ra on vocals on track #8, \"Trying to Put the Blame On Me\" (a.k.a. \"Blame Shame\").\nThis session has been circulating for years among Ra collectors, with varying fidelity and altered track sequences. The audio is far from ideal. Coleman laments \"the hiss and crackle inevitably associated with low-watt radio broadcasts of the era.\" Yet for an ad hoc Sun Ra capture—especially compared to dozens of unauthorized low-grade Ra bootlegs—it's quite good (Coleman agrees). This digital release offers a modest upgrade, as artifacts have been removed, dropouts repaired, distortion lessened, hiss reduced, and other flaws fixed or minimized. There's some residual hiss, as befits a 1970s analog recording, and some ghostly high-end sonic artifacts which could not be completely removed without loss of brightness.\nThe final track, \"Quest,\" was issued in 1982 on a 7\" single (Saturn Gemini 1982Z), strangely credited to \"Sun Ra & His Outer Space Arkestra.\" It was twice reissued: on Sun Ra — the Singles (Evidence, 1996) and Sun Ra Singles: The Definitive Collection (Strut, 2016). In all three cases, the audio was marred by tape flutter and wavering pitch. For this digital set, we obtained a superior transfer of \"Quest\" which tracks relatively in pitch.\n—I.C.\n=======\nRodger Coleman's 2013 Sun Ra Sundays take on this session is worth quoting at length (with minor edits):\nStarting off with bluesy improvisation, it’s sadly apparent that WKCR’s piano had seen better days: it’s out of tune, some of the keys are sticky, and the voicing is wildly inconsistent, dull and indistinct at one moment, shrill and piercing at another. But Ra makes the best of it, exploiting the weird resonances and at times making it sound like a funky clavinet or electronic Rocksichord. Although apparently improvised, there is an elegant structure, with a contrasting, “classical”-sounding middle section, complete with delicate trills and impressionistic arpeggios. The old stand-by, “St. Louis Blues,” is up next and it’s another barn-burning performance: three, four, five independent voices ringing out simultaneously in wildly swinging counterpoint. Ellington's “Sophisticated Lady” follows and it’s given an oblique, fractured reading, with radical, pantonal re-harmonizations and some astonishingly intricate passage work—check out Sonny’s ultra-dexterous left hand! Another blues improv again brings out Ra’s brilliantly orchestral pianism with nimble bass riffs and thrilling horn lines, his two hands amiably wandering through distant keys.\nAfter that virtuosic display, it seems Sonny is just getting warmed up! An untitled original pits an agitated ostinato in seven against skittering right-hand flourishes and beautiful block-chord harmonies. The stuttering bass-line almost sounds familiar, but I can’t quite place it. “Take the 'A' Train” is a ruminative extrapolation on an old favorite, blithely dispensing with the clichéd familiarity and nostalgic sentimentality associated with this well-worn warhorse. His explorations of low-register tone clusters and fiery single-note runs easily rival the intensity of Cecil Taylor at his most bombastic—but no matter how “out-there” it might sound at times, Ra deftly brings it back around to the ragtime and swing which form the basis of jazz. The vast expanse of African American musical history, from emancipation through the avant-garde, is seemingly encapsulated in this four-minutes-plus version of “Take the 'A' Train.”\nAnother unknown title follows: a two-chord vamp with pretty right-hand melodies, a space-rhumba feel that gradually morphs into straight-ahead swing before going out. Although dreamy and eminently enjoyable, it feels more like a sketch for a potential Arkestra arrangement than a fully-fleshed composition.\n“Trying to Put the Blame on Me” is a doleful, two-chord vamp over which Sonny starts to sing. There is no microphone near his mouth, so at first you can barely make out what he’s saying. But there are other voices in the background, faintly echoing Ra’s declamations: June Tyson and John Gilmore. The station engineers frantically move around mic stands and the song eventually starts to coalesce, a darkly paranoid indictment of those who would blame Sonny for … what? I’m not sure. “What’s the name of this game?,” he asks. “Cuz if I’m the cause of it all, then that makes me the boss.” Whatever it is, he sounds eager to assume the role. According to Campbell & Trent, “Trying to Put the Blame on Me” would reappear almost ten years later at a concert in Cambridge, Massachusetts on June 10, 1986 (p.491-492). Surely, this song was performed at some point in the intervening years—or perhaps not? Maybe the subject of this diatribe was so specific, it only needed performing once in a while.\nThe last track was deemed good enough to appear on a 1982 Saturn single titled \"Quest.\" It's a short but intriguing tone poem, with jagged, irregular melodies, Morse code rhythms and brittle, uneasy silences.\nSonny’s performance here is extraordinary, combining the contemplative meditations of a studio session with the dazzling technical displays of a live concert. Sun Ra was not just a great composer and bandleader, he was a fluent pianist and the living embodiment of a deep-rooted tradition dating back generations, a fact that sometimes gets lost in all the big-band hoopla and space-age gobbledygook. Here's proof.",

            "about": "The piano was Sun Ra's primary instrument (the organ being secondary). However, he mostly performed and recorded with it surrounded by his Arkestra, in both small and large ensembles. Around 1966, Sunny recorded two sets of solo piano works, which were issued a few years later on his Saturn label under the title \"Monorails and Satellites\" (Volumes 1 and 2). Thereafter, Ra began to explore any electronic keyboard he could get his fingers on, including the Moog synthesizer (specifically, the Minimoog), Rocksichord, Clavinet, Gibson Kalamazoo, Farfisa, and others (including some to which he applied exotic names).\nRa and his bandmates moved from New York to Philadelphia in 1968, taking up residence at 5626 Morton Street, where they lived for the duration of Ra's active career. According to those who lived in the house, Ra didn't have an acoustic piano on the premises; he practiced and recorded exclusively with electronic keyboards (including electric pianos).\nFor a few years, beginning around 1977, Ra revisited the piano as a solo vehicle. He recorded two albums for the Improvising Artists Inc. label, as well as one, \"Aurora Borealis,\" for his own Saturn label (recorded 1980, issued 1981). He also recorded a solo piano set in Venice in '77; it was posthumously released on CD (and is available digitally in our catalog).\n\"Solo Piano, Vol. 1,\" the first of Ra's two albums for IAI, features four originals, a Jerome Kern standard, and Ra's arrangement of the traditional \"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.\" The album was issued on LP in the US in 1977, and on CD in Italy (1992) and Japan (2004). A live set—\"Volume 2\" of the IAI two-album deal—was recorded in 1977 at the New York venue Axis-in-Soho and issued the following year under the title \"St. Louis Blues.\" The Axis performance was filmed and later issued for the home video market.",

            "about": "Some Blues But Not the Kind That's Blue is a Sun Ra rarity: an album recorded at a single session, with the location, date and personnel generally agreed upon by historians. It was also a fairly cohesive album, featuring small units of the larger Arkestra playing idiosyncratic arrangements of Tin Pan Alley standards. This is largely an acoustic piano album, with Sun Ra's keyboard in prominent focus, the horns and percussion serving primarily in support roles with occasional solos. There is no bass except on the opening title track, which was the only Sun Ra original to appear on the 1978 Saturn LP edition. An unreleased, untitled session outtake, a free-form collective improv, was first included as a bonus track on a posthumous CD reissue; it appears on this 2015 remastered edition with an assigned title.\nWhile the titles and melodies of the standards are well-known, Sun Ra re-invents them in his singular fashion. Even \"My Favorite Things,\" which in jazz lore connotes John Coltrane more than Julie Andrews, ventures into uncharted territory. The track features some plaintive tenor voicings from longtime Arkestra mainstay John Gilmore, whose 1950s stylings taught Coltrane a thing or two about modal improvisation. Ra's fingerings are unpredictable, yet instructive. A lifelong student of the art, he had a penchant for distilling the entire history of jazz piano into his style, interspersing structure with abstraction, seemingly indifferent to time signatures and conventional notions of harmony and tonality. His touch is thoughtful, rarely hurried, and exploratory. The absence of bass is compensated for by Ra's left-hand patterns. He doesn't just play these tunes—he is immersed in them.\nThe title of the bonus track was assigned by Michael D. Anderson (of the Sun Ra Music Archive), who played with the Arkestra sporadically during this period, and identified the piece as a developmental version of \"Outer Reach Intensity-Energy.\" The title doesn't reappear in the Ra catalog until 1985, when a radically different arrangement turns up on a collection of live tracks called Stars That Shine Darkly Vol. 2. However, the provenance of those recordings is conjectural, with a strong likelihood they were made between 1975 and 1978, around the time that Some Blues was recorded.\nIf you enjoy Sun Ra's piano excursions in small group settings, check out Omniverse, which features five original works recorded in 1979 at Variety Studios.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "As live, late-1970s Sun Ra albums go, Somewhere Over the Rainbow is a cut above. It's similar to and contemporaneous with The Soul Vibrations of Man and Taking a Chance on Chances, two live sets also issued on Saturn in 1977 (and available in our remastered digital catalog).\nTape was not available, but we worked from a solidly transferred, clean 1977 Saturn LP (catalog #7877). As with many limited-release Saturn pressings, Somewhere Over the Rainbow offers exciting performances and solos preserved with dollar-store acoustics. Audio restoration can't add what the gear didn't capture—e.g., you can't \"remix\" the balance of instruments recorded with ad hoc mic placement—but these tracks here benefit from digital cleanup and sonic improvements (including phase correction, an issue with a number of Saturn releases).\nThis expanded Beyond Saturn edition includes two bonus tracks sourced from a stray tape from the original live 1977 dates. These tracks are not previously unreleased—they were previously and deliberately \"misfiled\" by the artist. That is, they were included on the A-side of a 1985 Saturn LP whose other content was unrelated.\nThe original 1977 release alternates four Sun Ra originals with three Tin Pan Alley favorites. It was during the 1970s that Ra began peppering his sets with Big Band-era standards, especially titles originally recorded by his heroes Fletcher Henderson and Duke Ellington. However, \"Gone With the Wind,\" \"Over the Rainbow,\" and \"Take the 'A' Train\" recur frequently in the career-spanning Ra discography.\nAlso of interest in this set is \"I'll Wait for You,\" whose throbbing disco pulse prefigures the dance floor stylings pursued by Ra on his later albums Lanquidity, On Jupiter, and Sleeping Beauty.\nThe performances were recorded at the Bluebird in Bloomington, Indiana. The discographic Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (by Robert Campbell and Christopher Trent, 2nd ed. 2000) notes: \"Michael Weiss says that the Arkestra played two nights at the Bluebird; each night consisted of two 3-hour sets. He recalls that 'the band paraded around playing \"Lights on a Satellite\" like on the Montreux album'. [Two] dancers were identified from two local newspaper accounts. These articles say there were 18 people in the band, and imply the presence of Pat Patrick and Vincent Chancey, plus a possible third drummer—none of them audible on these tracks. Weiss, however, is sure that Patrick and Chancey were not present.\"\nThe two bonus tracks, \"Outer Reach Intensity-Energy\" and \"Cosmos Rendezvous,\" were first issued by Sun Ra on the 1985 LP known as Stars That Shine Darkly Vol. 2, and alternately called Outer Reach Intensity-Energy. There was no identifying information included with the release—typical of Ra during the 1980s, it was issued in a generic sleeve which may or may not have been adorned with hand-art and no info except track titles on the label. However, Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive found these tracks on a tape associated with the Bluebird dates.\n— I.C.\n====\nComments on Somewhere Over the Rainbow by Bro. Cleve:\n\"We Live to Be\" and \"Gone With the Wind\" feature Ra on Yamaha YC-30 organ. On both tracks, but particularly on the latter, you can hear how Ra moves around the chord structure and tensions with the organ sustain differently than he would on solo piano. You can also detect Gershwin and Rachmaninoff in his voicings. As these two tracks demonstrate, recording Ra's organ was always a perilous undertaking. He loved to overdrive the combo organs to add distortion. (While amplifiers like the Fender Twin and Dual Showman worked well with transistorized organs, it appeared in one fuzzy photo that he was playing through a Sunn bass amp—one would hope!)\nRa favored the YC-30 in the mid-'70s, especially on albums recorded in 1977. The YC-30 made cool-yet-cheesy sounds—the way Sunny liked 'em. It had a bass octave, a portamento strip that served as a ribbon controller for theremin-style effects and pitch bending, a built-in fuzztone, reverb, and a repeater, which would make notes serially repeat while the key was held down. The YC-30 could be tilted forward to play at an angle; this allowed the audience to see the player's hands and view switch-work. When the Arkestra went to Italy in early 1978, Ra obtained a Crumar Mainman prototype (the instrument was reportedly never sold commercially), which he used into the mid-'80s. Ra liked portable combo organs because they were easy to carry on tour. In the late 1960s he used a Gibson Kalamazoo G-101 (which Zappa used to great effect for weird sounds on Uncle Meat, Burnt Weeny Sandwich, and Weasels Ripped My Flesh). In the early 1970s, particularly when he first toured Egypt, Ra used the Eko Tiger, a compact Italian-built organ, as well as a classic Farfisa. Combined with the equally easy-to-lug Rock-Si-Chord and Minimoog, Ra had quite an electronic keyboard arsenal, all of which were effectively distorted through tube amps.\n\"I'll Wait for You,\" as noted above, is Ra's first foray into \"funky disco,\" perhaps his first recording with four-on-the-floor kick drum, which thus foreshadowed the albums Lanquidity and Disco 3000 (both issued in 1978).\nSOTR contains a number of swing tracks, which were entering Ra's set-lists with increasing frequency, a pattern that continued to the end of Ra's playing days. He began introducing Big Band standards into live shows around 1973; one of the earliest citations is \"King Porter Stomp\" played in a \"straight\" style on Live at the Gibus (1973). Within a few years, the Ark was regularly swinging \"Hey Man,\" \"Keep Your Sunny Side Up,\" \"Bye Bye Blackbird,\" and \"Sophisticated Lady,\" but other than solo piano recordings, few such arrangements made it to LP until 1978's Unity.\nWhen I was with the Del Fuegos, we played The Bluebird. Looking at photos, it was good-sized stage. Ra could have had the piano and organ next to each other per his usual setup. However, there are inconsistencies in the recording perspective. The piano is in the left channel on \"Over the Rainbow,\" but on other tracks it's on the right with the organ. Surely they didn't reposition the piano. On \"A Train,\" the piano is on the right, but starts distant, then gets louder. There's no volume control on a piano, so they must have moved the mics. There are a couple of instances (which can't be fixed) of the mics going in and out on the left channel, probably caused by faulty (and cheap!) equipment set up in makeshift fashion.\nTenor saxophonist John Gilmore sounds great throughout, although not as ferocious as he does on comparable live tracks on 1977's Taking a Chance on Chances.\nVoices on this album are typically problematic. On \"Make Another Mistake,\" the band does one of their walk-offs in which they march around the room while chanting. They didn't bring mics onto the floor so the vocals are distant, but the spirit pervades the room. On \"I'll Wait For You\" it sounds as if they went to the front of the stage for the cosmo-drama, with vocals emanating from upfront house speakers that could not be picked up clearly by mics set up by the drums. Impossible to fix, but the soul is self-evident.\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nBrother Cleve attended many live Sun Ra performances starting in the 1970s. He has produced recordings by Waitiki and Mr. Ho's Orchestrotica, as well as two volumes of Bombay Disco. He has played keyboards for the Del Fuegos, Barrence Whitfield & the Savages, and Lounge Music revival trendsetters Combustible Edison. Cleve penned liner notes for Sun Ra Exotica (Modern Harmonic, 2017), and co-mixed (with Sean Slade) the forthcoming premiere release of 1986 Boston recordings made by Sun Ra & the Arkestra in conjunction with Bill Sebastian's OVC project.",

            "about": "2023 NOTE: The six tracks on SOUND SUN PLEASURE, originally issued by us digitally in 2014, were remastered in 2022 for inclusion on our 2023 expanded edition of JAZZ IN SILHOUETTE, which is available on LP, CD, and digitally. The annotation below is from our 2014 edition of SSP. We are keeping this short album available separately in case anyone wants SSP in its original configuration with the original (thumbnail) album art. All six tracks are full stereo on both SSP and JiS.\n-------------\nSound Sun Pleasure was recorded in Chicago at the same March 1959 sessions that produced the instrumental album Jazz In Silhouette, and features near-identical personnel. However, the recordings sat on the shelf for over ten years, finally achieving release in 1970. Whereas Silhouette was comprised of Sun Ra originals, Sound Sun Pleasure explores two works Sunny co-composed with trumpeter Hobart Dotson and four standards, two of which (\"'Round Midnight\" and \"Back In Your Own Backyard\") are sung here by Hattie Randolph (or \"Hattye,\" as her name is spelled in Saturn LP credits), whose soulful delivery enhances the uniqueness of this recording date. As a collection of mostly familiar tunes, the short (about 25 minutes) album serves as an accessible introduction to the maestro's music for those likely to find his experimental and avant-garde work difficult to embrace.\nThe 1950’s were a creative and transitional period for Sun Ra and other Chicago jazz arrangers. It was during this period that Quincy Jones emerged as staff arranger for Mercury Records. Sun Ra was one of his local contemporaries, arranging for large and small bands led by mainstays like Fletcher Henderson and Red Saunders, as well as for R&B and doo-wop ensembles. While Sunny did not have the chart-topping success of Jones (who crossed over into the pop market), he was highly sought for his sophisticated and increasingly idiosyncratic jazz-tinged arrangements.\nTenor saxophonist John Gilmore's and baritone saxophonist Pat Patrick's solos give the arrangements the Chicago “Hard Bop” feel. The set displays Sunny's gentle side with a moving rendition of Thelonious Monk's classic \"'Round Midnight,\" while the Sun Ra/Hobart Dotson collaboration \"You Never Told Me That You Cared\" unfolds as a majestic ballad before a sudden tempo acceleration at its midpoint. The instrumental \"Enlightment\" is the same recording that appeared on Jazz in Silhouette. The reason for its overlapping appearance is unknown, but we're presenting Sound Sun Pleasure as Ra released it.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Before Sun Ra began navigating the cosmic flux and piloting passengers across the universe, the bandleader Herman \"Sunny\" (or \"Sonny\") Blount (b. Birmingham, Alabama, 1914) was developing his musical craft in Chicago. In the early and mid-1950s that meant collaborating with artists in the fields of doo-wop, rhythm & blues, late-period big band jazz, and urban soul. History reveals that before Sun Ra was an orchestra leader, he was a session leader.\nRecording-wise, this is an erratically chronicled period, with hundreds of extant recordings, many beneath the grade of standard audio fidelity, dozens issued on (now-rare) Saturn singles, and a number of period pieces now considered classics. Space Age Rhythm & Bop is by no means a comprehensive collection, but it does feature many favorites and a few rarities.\nThe material offered here has been reissued over the years on various compilations on other labels (see below). Why recycle? Because on this digital collection, we've attempted sonic upgrades on most of these tracks. We've fixed dropouts, removed intrusive (non-musical) artifacts, reduced hiss, adjusted volume imbalances, lessened sibilance, and on one track repaired a skip that has been reproduced on every previously released version. Nothing fancy: no added reverb, no compression, no radical EQ, no ridiculous scrubbing of every sonic imperfection. We've retained the raw soul of these recordings, and flaws still abound.\nSun Ra was not credited as featured artist on any of these recordings. He composed, co-wrote, arranged, accompanied, produced, and/or coached the vocalists (especially in harmonies). To those who only know the Arkestra-era Sun Ra, his presence on these recordings would be imperceptible, and might even seem implausible. But this is where Sunny paid his dues, and where he initially left an impact on the Chicago regional music scene. He can be heard here on a couple of tracks briefly providing direction to the singers.\nThese tracks—a few here, others there—have previously been reissued with dozens of additional Ra-related 1950s tracks on:\nSun Ra: The Singles (Evidence ECD 22164-2)\nSpaceship Lullaby (Atavistic 243)\nSingles Volume 1: Definitive 45s Collection 1952-1961 (Strut 148)\nInterplanetary Melodies (Norton ED-352)\nThe Second Stop Is Jupiter (Norton ED-353)\nRocket Ship Rock (Norton ED-354)\nThis collection serves as a primer for initiates to Ra's early work. For extended exploration, we recommend the above compilations.\n—I.C.",

            "about": "A celestial journey is what Sun Ra and His Arkestra created with Space is the Place. Sun Ra’s opus, at its simplest, is a trip through outer-bound melodies, planetary bodies, eras in time, crystals, and space caravans. You will be transported a world away!\nThe film soundtrack of SPACE IS THE PLACE is an entirely different journey than the identically titled 1973 Blue Thumb LP. The latter project was an audio-only vinyl platter; the 1972 sessions were produced for use in the soundtrack of the James Coney-directed film SPACE IS THE PLACE.\nThis remastered, expanded reissue of the original soundtrack album, first issued in 1993 on the Evidence label, features an album's worth of previously unissued recordings from the same 1972 film soundtrack sessions.\nThis expanded edition also features The Mathematics of the Altered Destiny, a second previously unissued album recorded at the same soundtrack sessions, now first released half a century after being recorded. These newly discovered tracks, courtesy of Michael D. Anderson's Sun Ra Music Archive, are heavy on the prose of Sun Ra, as he and the Arkestra's Saturnian Queen June Tyson bestow countless bits of wisdom, apocrypha, mystery, and inspiration upon the listener.\nThe 2023 expanded edition of SPACE IS THE PLACE: THE FILM SOUNDTRACK is also available from Modern Harmonic on 2CD, 3LP, and DVD (catalog MH-8267).",

            "about": "In Spring 1966 Sun Ra and his Arkestra embarked on a tour of five upstate New York colleges. Recorded on May 18, 1966, at St. Lawrence University, in Potsdam, NY, this illuminating collection presents the full 70-minute first set, a partial recording of the evening's second set, and some pre-concert, soundcheck rehearsal takes.\nThe nature of the somewhat ad hoc 1966 engineering setup prevented a best-quality audio capture, and there are technical shortcomings in these recordings. Nonetheless, this historic set offers a spectrum of the band's repertoire, arrangements, and stage virtuosity over almost an entire evening. The performance roughly coincides with the 10th anniversary of the Arkestra's debut studio sessions in Chicago, 1956. The sets include the rarely performed \"State Street,\" as well as alternate versions of \"Theme of the Stargazers,\" \"The Exotic Forest,\" \"Velvet,\" and \"The Second Stop Is Jupiter.\" The tour reportedly included SUNY Buffalo, Syracuse University, and several other unidentified colleges.\nAccording to longtime Ra percussionist Tommy Hunter, the Arkestra often worked with two drummers during this period. A second drummer is audible on these recordings, but he is not identified in existing tour recording documentation. Saxophonist John Gilmore suggested Roger Blank or Jimmy Johnson as the second drummer.\nThe set was compiled and remastered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive from the original source tapes.",

            "about": "The second of two Sun Ra solo piano albums issued by Paul Bley's Improvising Artists Inc. label in the late 1970s. The first, \"Solo Piano, Vol. 1,\" was a studio set; the second, titled \"St. Louis Blues,\" was recorded live at the Axis-in-Soho venue in July 1977. It was issued on LP in 1978, and on CD in Italy (1992) and Japan (2004). The album presents four original works and Ra's interpretations of three Tin Pan Alley standards.\nIn 1996 IAI issued a videotape (VHS format) of the concert, which had been recorded live with multiple cameras. During the performance, the camera stream with applied video synthesis was projected for viewing by the club audience. On the VHS edition, the opening album track, \"Ohosnisixaeht,\" was replaced with a live rendition of \"Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child.\"\nFor this Bandcamp-only digital release, audience response has been omitted before and after each track. All you will hear is the music performed by Sun Ra, none of which has been edited or processed in any way. If you prefer to hear the recordings in the original concert context, with applause, hooting, whistling, and exclamations, they can be heard on the LP and CD editions, as well as on digital editions at other platforms. We feel these audio artifacts intrude on intimate listening to Sun Ra's rhapsodic keyboard meditations. In addition, the digital album cover for this Bandcamp-only release differs from the original release, featuring an adaptation of the back cover of the original LP and CD. We opted to distinguish this modified music-only edition from the original version which contains audience response.",

            "about": "These recordings originated at the same Variety Studio sessions that resulted in the 1979 Saturn release SLEEPING BEAUTY (a.k.a. Door of the Cosmos). Based on known departures and arrivals of various players in the Arkestra, Sun Ra historians have cited a likely recording date of June 1979. These three tracks were sold to Rounder and issued on LP in 1980; Sun Ra retained \"Springtime Again,\" \"Door of the Cosmos,\" and \"Sleeping Beauty\" for release on Saturn.\nExcerpts from the AllMusic Review by Ra authority Sean Westergaard:\nThe band Sun Ra had at the end of the '70s was surely the funkiest he ever had, with electric bassist Steve Clarke (in tandem with upright player Richard Williams) and the twin guitars of Taylor Richardson and Skeeter McFarland.\n\"Celestial Road\" kicks things off, where electric bass, arco bass and wah-wah guitar set the stage for a great June Tyson vocal, followed by solos from John Gilmore [tenor sax], Michael Ray [trumpet], Sun Ra [keys], and Damon Choice [vibes]. \"Say\" has a great electric bassline and joyous horn charts, and swings mightily with a vaguely Latin rhythm. There's a fine electric guitar solo, as well as some more fantastic playing from Gilmore. Ra's keyboard sounds and soloing are particularly deranged on this album, but never get into the purely noisy realm.\n\"I'll Wait for You\" is the real treat of this album, featuring a great mellow groove and wonderful ensemble vocals led by the beautiful June Tyson. There's plenty of fine soloing on this track as well, but the main attraction is the mix by Ra and Michael Ray. There's a dub-like element to the way the instruments and voices are treated and mixed in and out, but this is dub by way of Saturn, and the mix is at least as weird and wonderful as anything Lee Perry has done. This is an overlooked album in an unwieldy discography, but it's a real gem. Recommended.",

            "about": "Fans of Sun Ra's Hard Space Bop and blues-based swing were in for a shock with Strange Strings (recorded in 1965—often erroneously reported as 1966—and released in 1967). This is an album without a genre, and demands an adventurous aesthetic on the part of the listener. Even in the eclectic and extensive Sun Ra catalog, Strange Strings stands alone.\nAfter a series of concerts at upstate New York colleges, Sun Ra purchased an arsenal of stringed instruments from curio shops and music stores on the road: ukulele, mandolin, koto, kora, Chinese lutes, and what he termed \"Moon Guitars.\" In the studio, these were handed out to his reed and horn players in the belief that \"strings could touch people in a special way.\" That the Arkestra members didn't know how to play these instruments was not beside the point—it was the point. Sun Ra called it \"A study in ignorance.\" To this unconventional \"string section\" he added several prepared homemade instruments, including a large piece of tempered sheet metal on which was chiseled the letter \"X.\" Art Jenkins was assigned intermittent improvised vocals.\nBiographer John Szwed explains what happened next: \"Marshall Allen said that when they began to record, the musicians asked Sun Ra what they should play, and he answered only that he would point to them when he wanted them to start. The result is an astonishing achievement, a musical event which seems independent of all other musical traditions and histories. The music was recorded at high volume, laden with selectively applied echo, so that all of the instruments bleed together and the stringed instruments sound as if they, too, were made of sheet metal. The piece is all texture, with no sense of tonality except where Art Jenkins sings through a metal megaphone with a tunnel voice. But to say that the instruments seem out of tune misses the point, since there is no 'tune,' and in any case the Arkestra did not know how to tune most of the instruments.\"\nThe original LP version of Strange Strings was monophonic, contained three tracks, and suffered distortion in the mastering (perhaps due to the high-decibel studio performance and excessive reverb). However, at least part of the session was captured in stereo, and at least eight tracks were recorded (not including rehearsals), six of which are included on this remastered edition. No track titles appeared on the original Saturn LP cover, but the three released works were later identified as \"Worlds Approaching,\" the LP title track, and an inversion of the title, \"Strings Strange.\" However, the master tape box indicates the third title as \"Strange Strange,\" the title we have used in this collection.\nThe LP track \"Worlds Approaching,\" originally released in mono, appears here in clear stereo for the first time. Although there is no date on the previously unreleased \"Thunder of the Gods\" (found on a different tape, in mono), the style points to this work having been recorded around (and possibly even at) the same time, as the approach is identical to the Strange Strings concept.\nThe previously unreleased tracks \"Cosmos Miraculous\" (featuring Sunny on Clavioline) and \"Moonshots Across the Sky\" were discovered on other tapes (in mono), and also reflect the exploratory Strange Strings instrumentation. The bonus tracks complement this collection perfectly. There remains enough unreleased rehearsal material for another volume. Cosmic Myth Records plans an expanded 2-LP edition in 2018.\nThe stereo tapes for the tracks \"Strange Strings\" and \"Strange Strange\" could not be located, and while we had to rely on the poorly mastered LP versions, we have succeeded in rectifying some of the sonic flaws of the original pressing.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Fans of Sun Ra's Space Bop and genre-bending jazz were in for a shock with Strange Strings. Even in the eclectic and sometimes baffling Sun Ra catalog, Strange Strings, first issued in 1967, is an outlier. Is it music, or just noise? Or noise as music? John Cage could not be reached for comment.\nFor this album, Sun Ra collected an arsenal of exotic string instruments and handed them out to his Arkestra on the precept that \"strings could touch people in a special way.\" That the Arkestrans didn't know how to play or tune these instruments was not beside the point— it was the point. Ra framed it \"a study in ignorance.\" The result was primitive, yet sophisticated; brutal, yet highly sensitive. In his essay for this expanded edition, musician-curator David Toop calls Strange Strings \"saturated in mystery.\"\nThe original 1967 Saturn LP version was monophonic, contained three tracks, and suffered distortion in the mastering (perhaps due to the high-decibel studio performance and excessive reverb). Yet some sessions were captured in stereo. A dozen strange-string works have been located, five of which are included on this remastered edition. No track titles appeared on the original Saturn LP verso, but the three works issued were later identified as \"World's Approaching,\" the LP title track, and an inversion of the title, \"Strings Strange.\" A belatedly discovered tape box listed the third recording as \"Strange Strange,\" a title which has been used in this edition.\nCD and LP are remastered with bonus tracks, with liner notes by Irwin Chusid, and an essay by David Toop. 2xLP Vinyl Edition pressed at RTI and packed in tip-on Stoughton gatefold jacket, and includes a printed insert card of the original cover art.",

            "about": "Greetings, Sun Ra voyagers! We commence with a caveat: If you're looking for melodies, structured compositions, pleasant harmonies, songs you can whistle, and serenades for social gatherings — seek elsewhere.\nThis is Triple-A Ra: Audacious, Aggressive, Adventurous. In the collection we've titled Stray Voltage, Ra is not so much composing music as painting soundscapes with electronic keyboards. Ra doesn't simply play these consoles — he attacks, cajoles, and pounds them. He upends and transports them where they weren't built to go. Sometimes they fracture under his assault. He steers them into the zone of intimacy and combat. They emit whirrs, hums, jolts and squiggles, crowned by explosions. Ra's repertoire includes feedback, distortion, torrents, and mysterious beeps from far-off planets. With one keystroke Ra could trigger a sonic apocalypse.\nThese performances might sound like they were generated by machines, but there was a robed wizard at the controls. Ra turns this musical circuitry into compressors and transformers, dynamos and turbines. He updates George Antheil for the Space Age.\nThese works also have the character of soundtracks for non-existent films. There is tension and mystery, chaos and disorientation. There are ominous crescendos, futuristic forebodings, and thematic non sequiturs. Animation, science fiction, surrealistic noir — listen to these works with your eyes shut, or in a darkened room, and imagine the action.\nOn these tracks there's music redefined, science repurposed — and journeys into the cosmic darkness. Some call it noise. Noise can be music too. It might not sound like earthly music, but that's because Space Pilot Sun Ra intended to take you on a pangalactic excursion, for which he created the mixtape.\nWhen Ra obtained a new electronic instrument, it's doubtful he read the instruction manual. He just switched it on and went to work, his paws tentatively probing it like a cat kneading a couch. The designers might have proposed a best-way to play. Ra ignored their tutorials — his understanding was intuitive. Once he became familiar with the action of the keys and the effects of the pre-sets, the real drama began. As recounted in the 2017 reissue notes for My Brother, The Wind, Vol. 1, a 1969 all-Moog synth session, an employee from the R.A. Moog Company attended an Arkestra concert in NYC to see the maestro onstage with his recently acquired Minimoog. The onlooker reported that Ra \"had not understood how the device was supposed to work or what it really ought to do (and the instrument appeared quite nearly broken),\" but he proclaimed that \"Sun Ra was the most exciting and captivating Moog performer he'd ever witnessed.\"\nThere is no consistency to Stray Voltage — it's a cornucopia. Stylistically, these tracks capture Ra's electronic peregrinations during the 1970s and '80s. The Arkestra — or one or two players — occasionally makes a cameo appearance. But Ra commands the spotlight.\nA couple of these recordings originated at 1985 gigs at the club Staches, in Columbus, Ohio. Two are from a 1985 lecture series at Berkeley, another from a 1988 concert at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center in Santa Cruz. A few were likely recorded at Ra's Philadelphia home. Others are of unknown provenance.\nA few actual titles were scribbled on tapes, e.g. \"Fourth Dimension,\" \"Manhattan Undertones,\" and \"Projection of Equation Infinity.\" Others had to be assigned names for publishing purposes. Using the Stray Voltage album title as a marker, we added a number which corresponded to the tape inventory, and appended words of ambiguity. Because with Ra, a Master of Misdirection, you can never be certain. There's one cover — a rumpled mutation of the 1933 Otto Harbach-Jerome Kern Tin Pan Alley standard \"Yesterdays,\" sundered by Ra's frisky fingerwork, which would have rendered it unrecognizable to the composers.\nTo the best of our knowledge, the only tracks in this collection which had been previously available are the two Berkeley DX-7 Etudes, which appeared on a limited-run 2006 CD compiled by Ra historians John and Peter Hinds as a supplement to their Sun Ra Research fanzine series.\nWe've often said that with Sun Ra, you get everything except consistency and predictability. The core quality in these electronic expeditions is confidence. In his journeys through inner and outer space, Ra didn't need a GPS: he knew where he was going and knew how to get there. In that place, they are whistling these tunes.\n— Irwin Chusid",

            "about": "Sun Ra wasn't concerned about discographical codification. He left it to Ra scholars to make sense of his sprawling catalog, and mysteries abound. Sub Underground (#1), released in 1974, is one of those confusing entries.\nThe 21-minute LP A side, \"Cosmo-Earth Fantasy,\" was presumed recorded at New York's Variety Studio in '74 , as noted in Campbell & Trent's massive discography, The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed., pub. 2000). That track was coupled on side B with three tracks from a purported \"live\" recording at Temple University that same year. Complicating matters from a title standpoint, Sun Ra released unrelated albums tagged \"Sub Underground series,\" and this particular album (which carried no personnel or recording info) also appeared in hand-designed sleeves under the titles Sub Underground #2, Cosmo-Earth Fantasy, and Live at Temple University 1974. If it was a live album, the Arkestra had performed before an audience possessed of such hushed reverence that they don't make a sound before, during, or after each piece. The Sun Ra Music Archive's Michael Anderson, a former Temple student, believes that the performance took place in the college chapel. Others have suggested the Temple radio station. The recordings on side B undoubtedly originated in a studio, an ad hoc studio, or—as it turns out—studios.\nEnter Ra scholar Paul Griffiths, who in 2011 found an album master tape of \"Cosmo-Earth\" formerly owned by the late Ra business partner James Bryant. In an Art Yard CD reissue, Griffith says the words \"strings bandura\" are handwritten on the reel. The beginning of \"Cosmo-Earth\" features sounds reminiscent of Ra's singular 1967 Saturn release Strange Strings, on which Arkestrans plucked and savaged string instruments with which they were otherwise unfamiliar. The bandura, dubbed the \"Space Harp,\" was featured on a number of Ra albums in the late 1960s. Griffith writes:\n\"['Cosmo-Earth'] features an opening section of music using the strange strings, including the bandura as mentioned on the tape box. As several of the string instruments were destroyed in a car accident in 1969, and the bandura itself was left in the possession of Hartmut Geerken in 1971 after the Arkestra’s legendary first Egyptian visit, this music cannot postdate these events and a revision of the recording date is needed.\"\nGriffith further observes:\n\"Ra plays Hohner Clavinet on this recording in close stylistic proximity to that on the LPs Atlantis [1967], Solar Myth Approach Vols. 1 & 2 ['67-'68], and Continuation ['68]. The feel of the whole piece is very much in the style of the exploratory work undertaken by the Arkestra in the later New York period between '66 and early ’68. It is very likely that this music was recorded in 1967 or possibly early 1968 before the Arkestra moved to Philadelphia.\"\nGriffith affirms that \"Love Is For Always\" and \"The Song of the Drums\" were indeed recorded at Temple in '74. But he reexamines \"The World of Africa,\" stating:\n\"… [It] is clearly not from the same concert as its predecessors and takes us back to 1968 when vocalist June Tyson joined the band. Ra is again featured on Hohner Clavinet playing very much in the style of the small group Atlantis sessions from the previous year, with a host of Arkestra members on percussion.\"\nEverything Griffith asserts is believable and logical. Ra was renowned for compiling LPs from unrelated sessions and different locations, with material recorded years apart and offering radical juxtapositions of style. Sub Underground is business as usual on Saturn.\nIn a catalog as massive as Ra's, it's natural for some releases to get overlooked. Sub Underground deserves more attention, as it's an adventurous album, and fun. The raw fidelity reflects the charming lo-fi characteristic of Sun Ra releases, or what we call \"Garage Jazz.\" The compositions, arrangements, and mixes deliver the eccentricity expected of Ra, and there's plenty of surprises. \"Cosmo-Earth\" features the otherworldly \"strange\" strings, Sunny's Clavinet, and a xylophone and flute duet. The string passage also sounds as if Sun Ra is strumming the strings inside the piano.\n\"Love is For Always\" is a lush, romantic ballad with John Gilmore's tenor sax providing the back rub. \"The Song of Drums\" features extreme stereo separation; most of the track offers exotic, improvised shout vocals (courtesy Eddie Thomas and possibly trumpeter Akh Tal Ebah) on the left channel set against distant drums, punctuated by Sunny's electronic keyboard, on the right. \"The World of Africa,\" with its repetition of a simple melody, is Sun Ra's impression of a canon (or round). Vocalist June Tyson chants a pleasant nonsense vocal for three minutes, while the band provides a loose rhythmic foundation.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "This is a very special recording, commercially released for the first time in 2015 thanks to the graciousness of radio station WNYC, which captured this concert at the Inter-Media Arts Center (IMAC), Huntington, NY, in 1991. Senior WNYC Concert Recording Engineer Ed Haber provides his recollection, as recounted at  WNYC.org  on May 22, 2014, the 100th anniversary of Sun Ra’s earthly arrival:\n\"Between 1979 and 1981 I’d regularly go to the Squat Theatre to see Sun Ra and His Arkestra. Located on West 23rd Street in Chelsea, Squat was just below street level, with windows open to the street. It was the perfect venue for Sun Ra, and the Arkestra marching in singing \"Space Is the Place\" was a sight to behold. Fast-forward ten years when I had the thrill of recording Sun Ra for WNYC at the Inter-Media Arts Center in Huntington, New York. Listening to the tapes now, stripped of the Arkestra's visual theatricality, I’m reminded of how well Sun Ra synthesized so many elements of 20th century jazz, from swing to the avant-garde. But regardless of style, the joy in the music comes through with every note. This concert was just two years before Sun Ra's \"earthly departure,\" yet his piano playing is still so vibrant and really drives the proceedings.\n\"Convenient, portable multi-track recording equipment was not widely available in 1991, and WNYC’s concert recordings at the time were exclusively direct to two-track mixes. (In fact, this was a digital 2-track recording using the DBX-700 digital audio processor which employed delta modulation rather than the more common PCM to convert the analog signal to digital.) At this concert one of our maintenance engineers, Karen Burdick, sat in the front row and relayed cues as to who was about to solo (we were probably mixing in the lighting booth in the back of the hall), and Michael DeMark (now Technical Director of Minnesota Public Radio's The Current) did a great mix.\"\nThis was a precarious period for the Arkestra. Sun Ra had suffered a serious stroke in November 1990, and remained in rehab until early February 1991. During his recovery the Arkestra performed a series of benefits to cover his medical expenses. Ra did not resume performing until late February. Two months later, this concert was staged. Sun Ra does not speak during the show (Michael Ray serves as the band's spokesman), but his piano playing remains idiosyncratic, and the band packs a wallop. This is as close to mainstream as Sun Ra got, yet longtime fans will hear no compromise in the master's style—which had always been more accessible than casual listeners realize.\nIMAC, run by Michael Rothbard and Kathie Bodily, was a 600-seat non-profit \"carved from the shabby remnants of an Art Deco vaudeville house,\" wrote the NY Times, who described it as \"a quirky, intimate space.\" Bookings ranged from pop to the avant-garde—\"a musical Eden,\" said one patron. After 26 years, it closed its doors in 2009, due to rising costs, declining public financing and competition from newer performance venues.\n– I.C.",

For context, Szwed is chronicling the evolution of Ra's style in the late 1950s, when the budding legend was based in Chicago, leading a midsized ensemble (already dubbed an \"Arkestra\"), and still working largely in subgenres identifiable as \"jazz.\" Szwed's reflections on Sunny's absorption with Exotica align the Afrofuturist icon with an unlikely musical inspiration:\n[quote] \"Sunny was listening to the Hollywood-inspired music being made by people like David Rose, whose lush, massed string writing could be heard as theme songs on popular radio programs; or to the exotica of people like Martin Denny, who recorded in Honolulu accompanied by animal noises, natural acoustic delay, and reverberation; and especially to the arrangements of Les Baxter, the premier figure in what was being called mood music.\n\"Baxter developed a post-swing style in the late forties and early fifties of spectacular orchestral writing, full of timpani and hand drums, tumbling violin lines, harps, flutes, marimbas, celesta, Latin rhythm vamps, the cries of animals, choral moans, and flamboyant singers, creating imaginary soundscapes which he helped evoke with titles like 'Atlantis,' 'Voodoo Dreams,' and 'Pyramid of the Sun.' Sunny first heard Baxter on Perfume Set to Music (1946) and Music Out of the Moon (1947). Baxter went on to produce records which celebrated the Aztecs (The Sacred Idol, 1959), South Asia (Ports of Pleasure, 1957), Africa and the Middle East (Tamboo!, 1955), and the Caribbean (Caribbean Moonlight, 1956), all of which used Latin rhythms generically, as did his two big band records, African Jazz (1958) and Jungle Jazz (1959). Though later generations would understand this music in strictly utilitarian terms, and hear in it the sounds of air conditioning and the clink of ice in cocktail shakers, for Sunny it was music rich with imagination and suggestion. His genius was to take as raw material what others in the 1950s thought of as 'easy listening' and turn it into what in the late 1960s would be heard as 'Third World music' by some and as 'uneasy listening music' by others.\" [/quote]\nPerhaps it's enough to say that Ra and Baxter were both musically omnivorous. However, Baxter, like Sunny, composed music that resisted the Earth's gravitational pull. His 1958 LP Space Escapade contained titles that share a vision with Ra: \"Saturday Night on Saturn,\" \"Moonscape,\" \"A Distant Star,\" \"The Other Side of the Moon,\" and \"A Look Back at Earth.\" His 1947 Music Out of the Moon is arguably the Rosetta Stone of outer space Exotica. Like Sunny, Baxter was an early adopter of the Moog synthesizer—he released the album Moog Rock in 1969, the same year Sunny found himself in Gershon Kingsley's Manhattan studio exploring the circuit-based sounds of the new instrument (featured on tracks he would self-release as My Brother the Wind). And Ra's 1957 debut LP Jazz by Sun Ra included Harry Revel's \"Possession,\" which had first been introduced on Baxter's album Perfume Set to Music.\nIn a 1996 eulogy for Baxter in Wired magazine, David Toop wrote that \"Baxter offered package tours in sound, selling tickets to sedentary tourists who wanted to stroll around some taboo emotions before lunch, view a pagan ceremony, go wild in the sun or conjure a demon, all without leaving home hi-fi comforts in the white suburbs.\"\nWas Exotica kitsch? Did it represent \"cultural appropriation\"? Was it a dilution of indigenous art? Who cares? Music should be enjoyed on its own terms. The Beatles were heavily influenced by American R&B. Ra borrowed from Gershwin and Stan Kenton. Nigerian juju music was radically altered by the infusion of electric guitars and Western rock. This is how styles develop and evolve. Exotica has roots, but those roots are uncopyable. What emerges is something derivative, yet original. Here you have Sun Ra, of African-American extraction, influenced by Les Baxter, a Caucasian from Texas, who was in turn influenced by primitive jungle rites. It's a cultural feedback loop, best enjoyed by leaving politics out of it.\n======\nHerman Poole \"Sonny\" Blount was born in 1914 in Birmingham, Alabama, where racial discrimination was endemic and historic. Music became his solace. During the late 1940s and 1950s he lived on Chicago's South Side, a black racial enclave. It was a culturally vibrant, if economically downtrodden community. Like many of his neighbors, Ra struggled to earn a living and aspired to move on. However, \"travel\" takes many forms, not all measured in miles. Paul Youngquist, in a chapter entitled \"Interplanetary Exotica,\" from his 2016 book A Pure Solar World: Sun Ra and the Birth of Afrofuturism, writes: \"One of [Sun Ra's] responses to the confinement of blacks, segregated as they were in Chicago's South Side and other such urban spaces […] involved deploying the cultural rhetoric of the Space Age toward the progressive ends of opening up wider vistas, new horizons. If blacks couldn't flourish in segregated cities, then maybe they could follow exotica into space.\"\nMainstream Exotica's sensuous dreamscapes underscored middle-class post-war optimism, providing rhapsodies for midcentury moderns. Ra knew the despair of the underclass, and created art that was no less escapist. Music could be transcendent; it could transport the listener. The root word \"exotic\" implies something strange, something unfamiliar, a place that's — anywhere but here. Maybe you can't afford a cruise to Barbados, but a stylus in a cheap microgroove LP could be a ticket to paradise—or the moon—for 20 minutes.\nThat Ra hasn't been widely celebrated in Exotica circles is understandable. He never made an \"Exotica record\"; such tracks are mixed in his LPs alongside space jazz, post-bop, electronic freakouts, and sonic experiments. Another reason: the most acclaimed Exotica LPs were \"clean.\" The labels and producers strived for technical perfection. Ra's catalog—indeed his style—is redolent with wrong notes, indifferent mixes, ad hoc mic placement, ill-tuned instruments, distortion, and dollar-store acoustics. Perfectionism? With Sun Ra, it’s all perfectly flawed. But where it lacks sonic purity, it offers something more gratifying: soul.\nRa is not known for cocktail party accompaniment or Tiki bar soundscapes. But here's a few dozen recordings that might suit the mood.\n[adapted from the full LP/CD package liner notes by Irwin Chusid]\nMODERN HARMONIC issued EXOTICA on vinyl and CD with extensive annotation and photos.\n3-LP set here:  modernharmonic.com/sun-ra-exotica-3-lp-set.aspx\n2-CD set here:  modernharmonic.com/sun-ra-exotica-2-cd-set.aspx",

            "about": "Sun Ra admired George Gershwin and paid musical tribute to the great composer's legacy countless times over his 50-year performing and recording career. This digital-only release, spanning 38 years (1951–1989), compiles some of the best recorded examples of Ra's idiosyncratic takes on the Gershwin catalog. These performances encompass a variety of styles and personnel — full Arkestra, trio with vocalist (Hattie Randolph), duo (Sun Ra and Wilbur Ware), and doo-wop (The Nu Sounds, arranged and accompanied by Sun Ra).\nMost tracks have been previously issued, although in most cases the audio has been remastered to fix flaws in previous versions. The live version of \"Rhapsody in Blue,\" recorded at New York's Squat Theater in 1979, has never before been commercially available. The 1950s rarity \"Nice Work if You Can Get it,\" previously only available on an Atavistic CD titled Spaceship Lullaby, has benefited from 60+ digital repairs.\nThe encyclopedic compendium The Earthy Recordings of Sun Ra (by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, 2nd edition) lists other Gershwin titles known to have been performed by Ra over the years: Lady Be Good; I Got Rhythm; Embraceable You; I Can't Get Started; and Liza. These titles have been documented by existing tapes in the hands of collectors. However, at present these recordings are not available, nor do we know if the audio quality of any would merit commercial release. There might be other Gershwin titles by Ra which have escaped the chroniclers.\n– I.C.\nGreat review at Pitchfork:  pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sun-ra-sun-ra-plays-gershwin  — unfortunately written without benefit of the above album annotation, which was published belatedly on Bandcamp.\nAllAboutJazz review:  bit.ly/2FJVum3\nChris May: \"Ra's ventures into the Gershwin songbook deserve to be treated with as much respect as those of Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong or any other less-polarising musician.\"\nBonus round: 2014 article from the Guardian which makes the case that Sunny and George were both freemasons:  bit.ly/2kFVxDQ",

            "about": "Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth was compiled from two studio sessions recorded from 1956 to 1958. Befitting the title, the A side of the LP presented a mystic travelogue in which the band descended on “Planet Earth,” time-traveled to the Garden of Eden to encounter “Eve,” and then zoomed to the Far East to explore \"Overtones Of China.\"\nThe side B tracks were recorded in 1956 and represent some of the first Arkestra sessions, showcasing Sun Ra's emerging Hard Bop Space Book. These sessions were produced by Tom Wilson for his Transition label, and many tracks were issued in 1968 under the album title Sound of Joy by Delmark. Planet Earth, which coupled tracks from the two unrelated sessions, was commercially released on Ra's Saturn label in 1966.\nPlanet Earth's title track is a different take than on Sound of Joy, and appears here for the first time in stereo. \"Overtones of China\" is a radically different (and longer) arrangement than the Sound of Joy version. \"El Viktor,\" \"Two Tones,\" and \"Reflections in Blue\" are the same takes as on Sound of Joy, but Planet Earth's 2014 digital transfers from the master tape offer greater clarity and higher fidelity. Planet Earth's \"Saturn\" is eight seconds shorter than on Sound of Joy because on the Delmark reissue, the tape machine ran noticeably slow, causing pitch problems. These flaws were avoided for this digital release. Before its inclusion on Planet Earth, \"Eve\" had not previously been released, but dates from the Wilson sessions.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "In November 1964, a number of New York musicians (including Sun Ra) formally banded together as the Jazz Composers Guild. Under JCG sponsorship, the series “Four Days in December” ran from December 28 through 31 at Judson Hall. Sun Ra and his Arkestra appeared on the 31st, along with the New York Art Quartet.\nAll of the music from the Four Days in December series was recorded by the JCG for its own label; a December 1964 announcement in Down Beat indicates that a sampler LP was planned as the first release. However, the Guild broke apart early in 1965, so this never came to pass. Later there were plans (again abortive) to issue the concerts on the Fontana label. Almost a dozen years later (1976), Sun Ra issued the LP \"Featuring Pharoah Sanders and Black Harold\" [comprised of tracks 6–11 of this digital edition].\nAhmed Abdullah (and the first edition of The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra) gave the location and date as Cellar Café, New York City, June 15, 1964, but this cannot be right because at that time tenor saxophonist John Gilmore was still in the Arkestra. [Gilmore left the Arkestra in summer 1964 to go on tour—as Wayne Shorter's replacement—with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers; Gilmore is not on the Judson Hall dates.] The album serial number [\"JHNY 165\"] was clearly meant to indicate a concert at Judson Hall, New York City, in January 1965, and a copy in Alden Kimbrough’s possession bears the title Live at Judson Hall written on the cover in longhand. On Kimbrough’s copy Pharoah Sanders’ name is written on the label for Side A and Black Harold’s is written on Side B. The January '65 date seems to be a slightly inaccurate reference to the Four Days in December concerts. (1968 is incorrectly given as the date in some discographies.)\nBasic personnel derived from a list given by members of the Arkestra to Bob Rusch. However, they forgot about Robert Northern. A review of Four Days in December by Don Heckman (Down Beat, February 11, 1965) gave a slightly different personnel list that referred to Pharoah as “Farrell Saunders,” added Ronnie Boykins (bass) and Jimmy Johnson (drums), and subtracted Cummings (bass clarinet) and Northern (French horn). Most likely Heckman was relying on a printed program (always dangerous with the Arkestra—there is no audible evidence that Ronnie Boykins was there, whereas Cummings and Northern definitely were). Heckman mentioned the titles “Other People’s Worlds” and “Water Lilies on Mars.” A.B. Spellman’s review of the concert indicates that “Water Lilies on Mars” was sung—which means it was not included on the 1976 Saturn LP. The Arkestra and the New York Art Quartet split the evening; the concert began no earlier than 8pm and finished at midnight. Most likely, then, some material from the Arkestra’s set remains unissued. [N.B. The full performance is included on this digital release.]\nBritish discographer Mike Hames also mentioned a “Space Mates” from this session, but this was included on the LP (thanks to Julian Vein for this information). In the first edition of The Earthly Recordings, the Heckman and Hames information was thought to describe a different recording and was listed as a separate session.\nAccording to Ra biographer John Szwed, Black Harold (or, as he was known in 1964 and identified by Heckman, Sir Harold) was formerly known as Harold Murray. He also played a large drum with the Arkestra (considerably larger than Jacson’s Ancient Egyptian Infinity Drum; regrettably, it does not appear on any known recordings). Harold also recorded in 1968 (as Sir Harold) with Galt MacDermot and (as Black Harold) with Big Black. According to Donald Leigh, he later changed his name to Brother Atu, and still later appeared as Atu Murray. Obviously a believer in having many names.\n[Adapted from The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, 2nd ed., 2000, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent]",

            "about": "Recorded in 1956, but released in 1957, Supersonic Jazz is arguably the first long-playing album by Sun Ra and His Arkestra on his Saturn label. However, it was not recorded as a debut. Rather, the album was assembled from tapes recorded during a number of sessions at two Chicago studios (RCA Victor and Balkan), and several tracks had been released as singles before their inclusion on this album. (Sunny's first fully realized commercial album was 1957's Jazz by Sun Ra, produced by Tom Wilson for the soon-defunct Transition label.)\nBefore these sessions, Sunny was still arranging for the Red Saunders Orchestra and singer Joe Williams, in addition to arranging for and coaching doo-wop ensembles. As Sunny's ambitions achieved liftoff, the Arkestra coalesced, began building a repertoire (mostly of the leader's originals), and made forays into studios. Deciding it was time for commercial releases, Sunny and business partner Alton Abraham launched Saturn (sometimes called El Saturn) as a record company in 1956.\nAs a first offering, Supersonic Jazz is a pinnacle Sun Ra release. While reflecting many prevailing bebop, Latin, and R&B conventions of the mid-1950s, it's evident that Sun Ra's musical voice and vision were starting to propel him away from the jazz mainstream. Biographer John Szwed finds on these recordings \"characteristics which seemed alien to swing, bebop, or the new, more soulful and hard-edged music which was coming to be called hard bop.\"\n\"India,\" \"Sunology,\" and \"Portrait Of The Living Sky\" delve into the mystic rhythms of an ancient Egyptian style. Jim Herndon and his tympani add a unique flair to the arrangements alongside other Arkestra members doubling on percussion. There are, in fact, a number of flavors on the album that seek an East-meets-West fusion, a virtual \"Ancient Exotica.\"\nSome titles such as \"Portrait of the Living Sky\" and \"Kingdom of Not\" appear on Supersonic Jazz and nowhere else; they do not recur in the massive Ra discography of studio, club, and concert recordings.\n\"Advice To Medics,\" which sounds like a living room recording, was captured during a 1957 rehearsal with vocalist Clyde Williams (who is not heard on the track). Some Ra scholars have speculated that the recording was reproduced at the wrong speed—recorded at 3¾ IPS, but played back at 7½ IPS. \"Blues At Midnight,\" the first recorded rendition of this timeless Ra standard (a longer version appears on Jazz in Silhouette) allows the band, who were the cream of Chicago’s bebop stalwarts, a chance to stretch out.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "This is not The Great Lost Sun Ra Album. It's a GOOD Lost Sun Ra Album, and it's been more or less found. Taking a Chance on Chances (or \"… on Chancey,\" as some typographically allege) was recorded at the Jazz Showcase, Chicago, in 1977, and issued on Saturn vinyl in 1977 (catalog #772). Only one problem: according to the authoritative Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent (2nd ed., 2000), \"all known copies of Saturn LP 772 have a defective pressing on Side A.\"\nTaking a Chance was a companion volume to The Soul Vibrations of Man (Saturn 771), issued around the same time. The two albums share comparable origins, personnel, and dollar-store acoustics. Soul Vibrations can be found here:  sunramusic.bandcamp.com/album/the-soul-vibrations-of-man\nBoth emerged from the Alton Abraham–Chicago division of Saturn, an operation that in Ra's omniverse was slowly approaching its sell-by date. Soul Vibrations was issued with a lavishly illustrated front cover; Taking a Chance was sent to market with various covers ranging from a grainy, underlit black & white photo of Ra crowned in Egyptian headdress, to generic sleeves festooned with taped-on strips of paper bearing the title and a small inset photo. Taking a Chance was apparently a very limited press run, perhaps as few as one or two hundred copies, and very few are known to exist.\nAs for the manufacturing flaws in Taking a Chance, here's a description by blogger Rodger Coleman: \"The pressing defect manifests itself in a woefully unbalanced stereo presentation and a near-constant overlay of scratchy noises and horrifically ugly distortion which only begins to clear up towards the end of the side. Ugh. Pressing the mono button helps a little (if you have one) but not much. As listeners to Soul Vibrations already know, these are not great-sounding recordings to begin with; the pressing flaw renders them almost unlistenable.\"\nWe can attest, having borrowed a sealed Saturn original from our friend Freddie Patterson, who allowed us to slit the shrinkwrap and drop a stylus in the LP's virgin grooves. Hoping to discover the world's only sonically pristine copy for a premiere reissue, we were disappointed to hear on Side A the \"horrifically ugly distortion\" described by Coleman. (Someone suggested we issue it that way for its \"exotic mix.\" We demurred.)\nFortunately, Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive unearthed a tape in 2016 that proved to be the closest thing to a \"pristine\" version. It's got problems, sure, but compared to the Saturn pressing, it's Rudy Van Gelder-grade. For the first time, we can hear what Side A was intended to sound like. The recordings capture some incidental noise (beyond applause) from patrons, but these artifacts convey an intimate club atmosphere and are not intrusive.\nThe first three titles on this digital reissue originally appeared on Side A of the LP. Some notes:\n\"Taking a Chance on Chances\" (6:27, stereo)\nThere's some conjecture about the title of the album, and about this alleged \"title track,\" which may or may not involve Ra wordplay on the name of the band's French horn player, Vincent Chancey. Campbell/Trent: \"According to Chancey, the first title on Saturn LP 772 was supposed to be 'Taking a Chance on Chancey,' which makes eminent sense: the piece is an improvised Ra/Chancey duet\" for organ and French horn.\n\"Lady Bird\"/\"Half Nelson\" Medley (8:32, stereo)\n\"Lady Bird\" is a vintage Tadd Dameron chestnut, \"Half Nelson\" a Miles Davis classic. Inexplicably, the SRMA tape contains a different take than the LP version. It's a half-minute shorter, but it's the same arrangement, the solos are comparable, the instrumentation and personnel sound identical, and it was likely recorded at the same venue during the same booking, perhaps even on the same date during a different set. The trumpet solo on the unlistenable LP version is over a minute and a half longer; Gilmore's masterful sax solos clock three minutes on both LP and tape. The mix is off on the ensemble passages, the horns somewhat buried beneath Ra's dominant Yamaha YC-30 Combo Organ, which remains dense even during the horn solos, but the powerful performances shine through. As ad hoc Ra live recordings go, this is worse than a few, but better than most.\n\"Over the Rainbow\" (5:21, mono)\nRa switches to piano for what is essentially a rollicking solo, with a bit of restrained trap accompaniment from either Tommy Hunter or Luqman Ali (both of whom are cited as having been on the gig).\nOn the original pressings of Saturn 772, side B was the GOOD side. Ironically, with the sonic upgrades to side A, Side B is here downgraded to a raucous clatter. The inferior audio isn't a pressing flaw; it's attributable to a woeful recording set-up at the club. Distortion, limited frequency spectrum, ad hoc mic placement, and ambient noise combine to produce one of those lo-fi captures with which any deep Sun Ra fan is familiar, and which generally appeals only to the most faithful of those fans. That said, the recordings are not without charm and archival significance.\n\"St. Louis Blues\" (5:09, mono)\nStill on piano accompanied by drums, Ra has Richard Williams on bass rounding out this trio rendition of the W.C. Handy relic (with a quick nod to Gershwin at 4:43). The tracks are identical on tape and LP, but the latter sounds terrible—the speed and pitch are off, and the mastering is egregious. The tape was excellent by comparison (a relative standard); it's on-pitch, faster, and offers greater clarity.\n\"What's New\" (10:09, mono)\nThis tune was a hit for Bing Crosby in 1939, and performances and recordings dot the Ra discography spanning 1962 to 1991. It's evident why Sunny felt compelled to issue this badly recorded performance—the smoking, extended tenor solo by John Gilmore, who is turned loose for five breathtaking minutes. The final minute and a half constitute a literal solo, as Ark and leader step aside while Gilmore dives into the vortex. The band then returns for an Ahmed Abdullah trumpet solo, which, following Gilmore's masterful tapestry, sounds like an afterthought.\n\"Take the 'A' Train\" (9:51, mono)\nSee \"What's New.\" Another audio snapshot with dust, wrinkles, discoloration and worn edges. But once again, Gilmore redeems.\nA bonus track has been added:\n\"The Sound Mirror\" (9:03, stereo)\nThis is a previously unissued recording. A regrettably lo-fi 14-minute version was issued as the title track on Saturn 19782 in 1978. This performance, believed to date from late 1977 or early 1978, features a tighter arrangement and greater sonic clarity.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "THE ANKH AND THE ARK\nSun Ra and Henry Dumas in Conversation\nSlug's Saloon, New York City, 1966\n[FULL LINER NOTES FROM 2001 CD ISSUED ON IKEF RECORDS]\nThis interview was discovered among a collection of tapes made by the late poet, storyteller, activist, and playwright Henry Dumas, whose work has been labeled \"genius\" and \"brilliant\" by Amiri Baraka, Toni Morrison and Clyde Taylor. Although no clear date or location is specified, it is likely that the dialogues were recorded at the legendary lower east side club Slug's in l966 when both Dumas and Sun Ra resided in the New York area. As was perhaps all too common, then as now, the tapes comprised an audio notebook that spanned several years and were continually recycled and put to new use in Dumas's quest to document the vibrant and shifting life around him. Hence, only a portion of the original interview survives.\nWhat is clear, however, is that this document, in any form, provides a crucial insight into a brief but tight bond between Dumas and Sun Ra, a bond which came to an abrupt end in a Harlem subway on May 23, l968 when Dumas was shot to death by a New York City transit cop. The two men were very close and Sun Ra waxed alternately angry and depressed when he received the news of his protégé's death. Members of what Toni Morrison would call the \"cult\" of Henry Dumas, too numerous to mention here, worked to achieve posthumous publication and acknowledgement of Dumas's writings, an event which greatly pleased Sun Ra. Among Dumas's magical and visionary writings is the epic fable, \"The Metagenesis of Sun Re\" which appeared in Drum Voices Review in l992. IKEF is grateful to Loretta Dumas for allowing us to make this document available to the public.\n- Eugene B, Redmond, literary executor of the Henry Dumas Estate, February 2001\n+ + + + + + + + + +\nCrow\nAn Interview With Sun Ra\nby Henry Dumas\nA musician with a great message of spiritual rehabilitation and wisdom is tirelessly working among Afro-Americans. His music has begun to spread around the world. He is creating, teaching, and restoring the vital elements in jazz which make it one of the black man's spiritual heirlooms. For the last twelve years he has been composing and playing a kind of music so different from traditional jazz (yet growing out of it) that it has been called the New Music. Blending Dixieland (the yesterday) with swing and bop (the today), this new music moves with lyric force into the sounds of the future. His name: Sun Ra.\nPlaying regularly Monday night sessions at Slug's in the East Village, Sun Ra is moving into what he calls Infinity. There are many questions surrounding the New Music's thrust into the world of jazz. As many questions as there are about the music, there are just as many about its progenitor. Aside from the fact that the nucleus of the Arkestra sprung out of Chicago, and that Sun Ra played piano for Fletcher Henderson, little is known about him, except that he did attend a southern college.\nThere are not many understanding or even tolerant critics of the New Music. For the most part, music tends to forge ahead of its critical milieu-not only of its often infantile critics, but of its listeners as well. LeRoi Jones has long recognized that Sun Ra is a genius. During his days with the Black Arts he worked closely with Sun Ra. Out of that association came, among many things, a play, Black Mass.\nLarry Neal, poet and playwright, and John Sinclair, Detroit poet and critic, both have written and spoken of Sun Ra's position in the New Music. Tom Fiofori, Nigerian critic, in the summer 1967 issue of Arts Magazine, writes that this music is so complete in its awareness of and references to the American Negro experience that it corresponds \"to all the 'schools' of the area of Negro musical heritage called jazz-going beyond the mainstream, past the New Wave and any other contemporary music played in America into a functional music that cultivates the sense of wonder, accustoms the mind to symbolic language and restores 'myth' as an important and permanent part of culture.\"\nInseparable from Sun Ra's music is his mythology, a sol-based cosmology that stretches deep into the secrets of the ancient Egyptians. l asked him once about his role of Ra, the Egyptian sun god.\n\"Everybody should try to be what they really are. They should search and find what they really are. That is what I really am. Some people are in the role of a diplomat or a congressman. I am in the role of Ra. To be what I really am, I must be on another plane of existence. On this stage of existence I am nothing. But on another I am in the role of Ra. It's just like when you go to the theater and you look at a beautiful stage. It doesn't stay that way. Pretty soon the next act brings you some different scenery.\"\nI asked him about Astro-Infinity music which he plays in the new Arkestra. \"Is this a way of relating jazz to the atomic age and the future?\"\n\"Astro-Infinity music is just one aspect of my music. It is heavenly, eternal, no beginning and no ending The highest aspiration for many on earth is freedom. Astro-Infinity music is beyond freedom. It is precision, discipline. It is not just freedom. It is coordination and sound interdependence. It is the design of another world. It has nothing to do with the traditions of yesterday, today or the future.\"\n\"What would you consider some of the possibilities of jazz in the future? I mean, considering the black man as the originator of jazz, considering the social revolution going on today and his attempts to resurrect some image of dignity for himself, where does jazz get into the picture?\"\n\"Well, you have to go back to some beginnings to talk about that. For one thing, the Creator gave the black man harmony in the beginning. And he tried to discipline the black man to use his gifts, but the black man was too unruly. Even the Creator couldn't handle him, or at least he decided against it. So, l guess the Creator turned the job over to me. But the black man has been worshipping death instead of trying to understand the ways of his Creator. Yet he won't make death his king. The equation doesn't balance. In religion, he believes in the cross, which is an X. When you X something, you eliminate it, you axe it. In the same religion the cross is the symbol of |ife. Anybody following the cross winds up dead in the cemetery with an X for his crown.\"\n\"Are you talking about the spiritual death spoken of by Christians or the death of the body?\"\n\"Both really. The black man is under the name of death. He carries it around with him. The word negro. It is the same as the word necro. The g and the c are interchangeable according to cosmic mathematics. It is an equation. A negro equals a necro. The sound of one is in the other. In the Greek necro means dead body. Necropolis is a city of the dead. Once you accept the name without checking into things, then you are automatically a citizen of the city.\"\n\"lf the citizens of a necropolis are dead, how does one resurrect them? I mean, in the analogy you just made, how are the souls called forth?\"\n\"Mostly through music and myth. But it's not just the black man who is in trouble. You can look in your newspapers and read how the whole planet is in trouble, in need of spiritual awakening. I am painting pictures of another plane of existence, you might say, something so far away that it seems nonexistent or impossible. ln infinite terms anything is possible. Nothing is impossible. People have always been looking for that world where nothing is impossible. A world of happiness, so they claim. But never have they been able to create it. All the great men on this planet have not yet come close to that world. They've tried everything and everybody. But people will have to have new mind-cepts. All the old ways will have to pass away. When people reach the stage when they can use their infinite mind power to concentrate and direct the truth in these cosmic equations I am talking about, then they will be ready for the grand experiment. There will be no more death in the next plane of existence. You might say that I am the bridge to the next plane of existence. When they reach that stage, they will be resurrected.\"\n\"What is the next stage and how will music be used?\"\n\"For the black man the first step will be toward discipline. Music is a force of nature. I am a force of nature. I am in the role of Ra because the Creator has left it up to me to give some order and harmony to this planet. Not everyone is in need of it. Many people are well developed spiritually and are growing. But most are not. So a force of nature gets them all. It's just like when it rains, it rains on everything and everybody. You might say that I represent all the forces of nature. People don't all know about this mind-cept, but in the Yoruba culture it is understood. In many parts of Africa this cosmic law is true among the people. If a man or a people reach a certain stage in their growth and development and then they just can't go any further, a force of nature incubates among them. And this force, be it the wind, the sun, rain, lightning, or thunder, whichever is really needed for that particular kind of development, achieves what could not be done A force of nature gets under you and drives you to do what you thought you couldn't. If I am in the role of Ra and I put some heat up under you, then you will move or burn up.\"\n- Henry Dumas",

            "about": "THE ANTIQUE BLACKS\nThe Antique Blacks, original copies of which are quite rare, was one of those LPs that Sun Ra pressed in very limited quantities to sell at concerts and club dates. The recordings apparently originated from a 1974 Temple University (Philadelphia) radio broadcast. Like many independently pressed and self-released albums on Ra's Saturn label, it's a mixed bag of material with little continuity or consistency. That's not a bug—it's a feature. It contains a jaunty jam (\"Song No. 1\"), a few songs, and lots of Sunny's declamatory (and inscrutable) sermonizing.\nAfter a 30+ year absence from the market , it was reissued on CD in 2010 by the U.K. label Art Yard, who replicated the LP sequence. In fact, due to the absence of tapes, a vintage vinyl copy was used for the reissue, which included a mono bonus track, \"You Thought You Could Build a World Without Us.\"\nAfter the completed CD production, Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive discovered the master tapes from the date. One of the revelations was that three tracks from the LP, \"There Is Change in the Air,\" the above-named bonus track, and the album title track, were actually part of a continuous 24-1/2 minute suite. When the original LP was compiled, some bridge material had been edited out, and three components of the suite were isolated as standalone tracks. For this digitally remastered edition, the entire suite is presented for the first time (and in full stereo). In addition, \"Song No. 1,\" which was the opening track on the LP, has been placed where it stands in sequence on the tape, as track 4.\nWhat sounds like an audio glitch at 7:21 in \"Space is the Place\" is in fact a four-second patch of tape spliced in reverse—Sun Ra's contribution to the sinister '70s practice of lyrical backmasking.\nThere was some speculation about the source of \"You Thought You Could Build A World Without Us.\" Based on comments made by Sun Ra himself on WKCR in 1987 (when it was aired), Sun Ra discographers Robert Campbell and Christopher Trent speculated that the track was an outtake from the 1972 film soundtrack for Space is the Place. However, RC/CT note that electric guitarist Dale Williams did not join the Arkestra until 1974. The discovery of the master tape confirms the provenance of the performance.\nHistorical footnote: Producer Hal Willner claims he witnessed these sessions at Temple University. Ask him about it.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "In early 1973, thanks to the intrepid persuasion of jazz producer Ed Michel, Sun Ra signed a licensing agreement with the prestigious jazz imprint Impulse (then part of ABC/Paramount Records) to reissue catalog titles from Ra's proprietary Saturn label, as well as some new Arkestra recordings. Michel had produced Ra's most commercially successful album, Space is the Place, in 1972 for Blue Thumb Records, and he figured Ra was finally primed for a wider Earthly audience. The Impulse deal struck with Ra and manager Alton Abraham specified a cap of 50 albums — ten annually for five years — although all masters were subject to approval by Impulse and theoretically less than 50 could be issued.\nWilliam Ruhlmann at AllMusic notes, \"This was Ra's first association with something like a major record company, and though it resulted in ten actual releases, it didn't last long; another 12 planned releases were cancelled.\" Eight (egregiously remixed and/or remastered) existing Saturn titles were repackaged; on other planets, extraterrestrial jazz scholars refer to the Impulse period as \"Ra's Quadraphonic Years.\"\nBesides the reissues, two newly recorded albums were released—Astro Black and Pathways to Unknown Worlds. Another pair, Cymbals and Crystal Spears, recorded in 1973, were assigned catalog numbers before being shelved. They must have been rejected quickly, because that very year three Cymbals tracks were incongruously grouped with some of Ra's earliest 1940s & '50s recordings on a Saturn LP entitled Deep Purple.\nThe Cymbals sessions took place at one of Ra's most favored recording venues, Variety Studios, in New York. Other than the three tracks on Deep Purple, the Cymbals (a.k.a. Symbols) sessions were unissued during Sun Ra's lifetime. Five tracks from these sessions (tracks 1 thru 5 on this 11-track complete edition) were posthumously issued on a 2-CD set by Evidence in 2000 under the title The Great Lost Sun Ra Albums (which included Crystal Spears). The Evidence CDs had to rely on substandard source tapes, which at the time were the only tapes available.\nThis 2018 double album on Modern Harmonic used session master tapes from Michael D. Anderson's Sun Ra Music Archive, and represents the complete Cymbals/Symbols sessions.\nCymbals constitutes an intimate gathering by Arkestra standards. Although eight [or ten—see note below] musicians were involved, nothing larger than a sextet and often only a quartet plays on any one track. Ra's illustrious tenor saxophonist John Gilmore only performs on one title (“Thoughts Under A Dark Blue Light”), and Danny Davis plays alto on another (\"Land of the Day Star\"). Cymbals is notable for being one of the few ensemble albums in Sun Ra's vast catalog that does not feature Arkestra mainstay Marshall Allen.\nAs Bro. Cleve writes in the liner notes to the LP and CD editions of the Cymbals/Symbols packages, \"The ABC/Impulse deal imploded, due to disappointing sales. The cut-out albums were dumped into bargain bins. Curiosity seekers heard Sun Ra, perhaps for the first time, for a dollar a disc. Sadly, the band made no money from sales of these LP’s. Ra returned to Saturn … Records, that is.\"\nA definitive remastered edition of Crystal Spears was issued on LP and CD by Modern Harmonic in fall 2018.\n—I.C.\nLP AND CD EDITIONS of CYMBALS/SYMBOLS\nISSUED ON MODERN HARMONIC\nRECORD STORE DAY APRIL 21, 2018\ninfo 2-CD:\nmodernharmonic.com/sun-ra-the-cymbals/symbols-sessions-new-york-city-1973-2-cd.aspx\ninfo 2-LP:\nmodernharmonic.com/sun-ra-the-cymbals/symbols-sessions-new-york-city-1973-2-lp.aspx",

Ayé claimed the track was recorded at the Ra house as a quartet, featuring Ra on keyboard, Ayé on drums, \"a cat named Khusenaton who came up with [Ayé] from Chicago\" on bass clarinet, and a bassist who Ayé couldn't recall or confirm. Marshall Allen confirmed to me that Khusenaton passed through the house at some point.",

            "about": "On The Invisible Shield, you get two (maybe even three) Sun Ra's for the price of one. Although many fans admire everything the maestro produced, some prefer his idiosyncratic take on jazz forms, while others thrill when Sunny dispenses with tradition and transmits killer sound waves from space. The Invisible Shield has something for both camps. There's big-band swing, propulsive hard bop, lounge jazz, and hypnotic Latin exotica. The counterpoints are lease-breaking skronk, destabilizing electronic alchemy, and pan-galactic sonic emissions.\nThe Invisible Shield is an extremely rare LP. It was never officially released on El Saturn (tho it did have a catalog number—529), and just a few hundred LPs were pressed around 1974 and sold at concerts. It never even had a standardized, printed cover—each copy was hand-designed. Several tracks appeared on such other releases as Janus, What's New, Satellites Are Outerspace, and A Tonal View of the Times.\nThe A and B sides of the LP traced a mind-scrambling excursion from Earth to Elsewhere. The first side offered rowdy, early 1960s post-bop renditions of Tin Pan Alley favorites arranged for quartet (2) and quintet (3, 4, 5, 6), along with a well-crafted original, \"State Street,\" for full band—a fairly mainstream outing by Arkestra standards. Side B opened with a locked-in Latin groove (\"Island in the Sun\"), before segueing into two jarring and uncompromising electro-acoustic soundscapes, probably recorded five years apart.\nThere's no stylistic bridge between the material. Sun Ra fans of the period were accustomed to new albums which were in fact compilations of older, previously unreleased material, often from different, unrelated sessions. The common denominator was the bandleader, who saw no need to stylistically unify the product. These albums were like samplers: Try this (hard bop), and if you like it, you might also like this (lunar beeps) by the same artist.\nThis remastered edition includes one unreleased track (\"But Not For Me\"); three stereo tracks (\"Time After Time,\" \"Easy to Love,\" and \"Sunny Side of the Street\") which had appeared in mono on the LP; and the full ten minutes of \"Island in the Sun\" (only half of which appeared on the LP).\nIf you're fond of hyperactive kick drums, the explosive Clifford Jarvis is in the house. Few tape decks were able to withstand his thunderous pedal action, as evidenced on tracks 3 thru 6, and his well-timed bombs no doubt jolted many a turntable stylus.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "\"For me, The Magic City is about the most important recording Sun Ra ever released: so many unprecedented ideas unveiled in one album.\" – Christopher Trent, co-author, Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra\n\"If any one piece was intended to be Sun Ra's monument, it is The Magic City.\" – Robert L. Campbell, co-author, Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra\nThis landmark Sun Ra album, now reissued in a definitive stereo edition on LP/CD and digitally, marks the launch of the new COSMIC MYTH RECORDS label. Cosmic Myth will reissue Sun Ra's SATURN Records catalog under official license from Sun Ra LLC, comprised of the artist's heirs, using the best available audio sources and meticulous remastering techniques.\n\"With supplemental material from the original tapes, the best possible sound and detailed research, this could be the single-disc reissue of the year.\" — NYC Jazz Record, Oct. 2017\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~\nSun Ra albums like THE MAGIC CITY prove the categorical futility of \"File Under: Jazz.\" When assessing the post-Chicago (1960–on) work of Ra, \"jazz\" turns out to be less a genre than a journalistic and marketing convenience. Jazz has a glorious tradition. Sun Ra was schooled in it, emerged from it, and grew to transcend it (though he never abandoned it). Even the cheeky term \"Space Jazz\" cannot frame the extremes to which Ra pushed his art in the mid-1960s. In this regard, THE MAGIC CITY was a pinnacle.\n1965 was a turbulent year for the Arkestra and its leader, and many consider THE MAGIC CITY a flashpoint for that upheaval. Arkestra drummer Tommy Hunter, quoted in John Szwed's 1997 Ra bio SPACE IS THE PLACE, describes a typical performance of the period: \"It was like a fire storm coming off the bandstand.\"\nOn the original 1965 THE MAGIC CITY LP, issued on Saturn, the monster 27-1/2 minute title track sprawled across side A. The \"Magic City\" to which Ra refers was his birthplace—Birmingham, Alabama. The term was the town's motto, emblazoned on a billboard by the train station near Sunny's childhood home, intended to reflect the city's explosive growth as a Southern industrial epicenter after the discovery of iron ore, coal, and limestone deposits. Birmingham was a place about which Sun Ra felt and expressed ambivalence: an outpost of racial segregation and grim smokestack-pocked landscapes, yet a city for which he felt twinges of nostalgia and affection. (His heirs still live in the area.)\nRa customarily supervised the Arkestra's improvisational process via keyboard cues or hand signals. He was always in charge—hence critic Simon Adams describing the title track as \"27 minutes of controlled freedom.\" \"The Magic City\" was never performed in concert; saxophonist John Gilmore said it was \"unreproducible, a tapestry of sound.\"\nAlthough shorter in scope than side A's magnum opus, the four works on THE MAGIC CITY's flip side reflect the same improvisational approach, spatiality, and lack of structure. One session outtake, \"Other Worlds,\" an alternate version of \"Shadow World,\" is included as a bonus track. Also included are the final 90 seconds of the mono version, which were curiosity omitted from Ra's own stereo version.\nThe LP and CD editions include liner notes by Sun Ra scholar Christopher Trent, along with a complete roster of musicians who performed on each track. Historical and technical liner notes are provided by noted jazz historian Ben Young, who restored and remastered the album with his Triple Point Records partner Joe Lizzi. Both men have been recognized for their production work on HOLY GHOST, the Grammy-nominated ALBERT AYLER boxed set released on John Fahey’s Revenant Records in 2005.\n-- THE MAGIC CITY: THE DEFINITIVE STEREO EDITION --\nFirst-generation Saturn pressings of The Magic City were monophonic. The album was reissued on CD by Evidence in 1993 with the title track in mono and the LP side B tracks in stereo. A full stereo version had been issued on Sun Ra's Thoth subsidiary label sometime after 1969; however, it suffered from a technical flaw that prevented many copies of the LP from tracking cleanly through the first cut on side B. A 1973 gatefold LP reissue on Impulse featured reprocessed stereo, and a cheap, terrible-sounding bootleg LP—on a badly replicated \"Saturn\" label—has circulated in recent years. For this definitive reissue, Cosmic Myth Records used stereo sources which are superior to the Thoth pressing.\nCosmic Myth Records is a partnership of Irwin Chusid, Michael D. Anderson and Virtual Label Group. Recordings will primarily use source tapes from Anderson's Sun Ra Music Archive, the world's foremost collection of original Ra session masters. The series is being co-produced and supervised by Chusid (Raymond Scott, Esquivel, Langley School Music Project, Songs in the Key of Z, WFMU).",

            "about": "The Night of the Purple Moon, recorded and released in 1970, has a vague flavor of the prevailing psychedelic zeitgeist of the late 1960s. That's due to the presence of two electronic keyboards that were popular with psych bands: the Rock-Si-Chord (commonly misspelled Rocksichord) and the Minimoog.\nThe former, built by Rocky Mount Instruments and first sold around 1967-68, was used by rock bands as a louder stand-in for the harpsichord, which could not compete against high-decibel electric guitars. (The Rock-Si-Chord was also famously showcased on Terry Riley's 1968 tour de force A Rainbow in Curved Air.)\nRa owned an early custom Minimoog (a portable Moog synthesizer), and had previously featured (pre-Mini-) Moog modules on My Brother the Wind Vol. 1, recorded in 1969. Ra would use the Minimoog on several more recordings, including the magnum opus \"Space Probe,\" and tour with it for several years. Unlike many recording artists at the time, Ra was not interested in using innovative instruments to frame familiar pop songs; he wanted to explore the sonic possibilities with futuristic music. Ra often treated the Minimoog brutally, wrenching from it exotic textures and distorted blasts at Richter-level magnitudes. Bob Moog invented the Minimoog. Sun Ra reinvented it.\nHowever, listening to Purple Moon, one gets the sense that after a decade of experimentalism and free jazz, Sun Ra wanted to make an accessible pop record. What he came up with is not Iron Butterfly, but had this record been properly marketed, it could have appealed to a segment of that band's market. If one-tenth of those who bought In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida purchased Purple Moon, Sun Ra would have reached the lower rungs of the Billboard charts.\nThe Arkestra on Purple Moon is skeletal, with only three sidemen: saxophonist John Gilmore (tenor on \"Impromptu Festival,\" drums on other tracks), bassist Stafford James (his sole recording with Ra), and Danny Davis, who plays reeds and percussion. Gilmore was one of the greatest saxophonists of his generation. As a drummer, he's one of the greatest saxophonists of his generation.\nDespite his predilection for making new music with new instruments, Sunny was not above offering \"cover versions\" of his own tunes: Purple Moon featured a remake of \"Love in Outer Space,\" first recorded in 1962 and initially released in 1965 on Secrets of the Sun. The tune eventually became a Sun Ra \"standard,\" with over 150 recorded versions in Ra's vast catalog. In addition to the Purple Moon LP version, we have included the 1975 vocal version, featuring singer David Henderson (also in his only recorded performance with Ra), and an alternate take. The title track is offered here twice: the original LP version and a previously unreleased alternate take. Unlike \"Love in Outer Space,\" these are the only two known recordings of \"Night of the Purple Moon.\"\nThe album contains three electronic solo works, \"Blue Soul,\" an old-fashioned torch song with space-age shimmer; \"Narrative,\" a choppy, yet propulsive work that seems less a composition and more a keyboard test-drive; and \"Outside the Time Zone,\" a bluesy romp that flirts with atonality. These three tracks were cited by Ra historians as having been performed on the Minimoog. However, Moog historian Brian Kehew disagrees: \"They sound like an organ or some other electronic keyboard, but not like a Moog.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "Originally titled The Lady With The Golden Stockings (released 1966), The Nubians of Plutonia (as it was retitled in the ca. 1967-69 reissue) was compiled from tracks recorded in Chicago in 1958 and 1959. Sunny was still in his Space Bop phase, although mystical overtones begin radiating through the jazz. The revised album title cleverly juxtaposes ancient Egypt with outer space—the primitive with the futuristic, characteristics reflected in the compositions and arrangements. The album is redolent with percussion, often played by Arkestra brass or reed players providing a simple, quasi-Latin or African rhythmic foundation behind solos. (Having everyone in the band play percussion remained a longstanding Arkestral tradition.)\nLike dozens of Sun Ra tracks recorded in Chicago in the late 1950s, this material was released in the late 1960s (long after Sunny had left Chicago) on the Saturn label, and reflected musical styles Sunny had long since transcended (but never abandoned).\nThese Saturn LPs were pressed in limited quantities and sold at Arkestra concerts, many of which presented new material radically at odds with the post-swing and hard bop contained on the vinyl. These LPs were also distributed by mail order and tucked in the bins of independent record stores who could get their hands on stock.\nSome tracks on Nubians echo the then-prevailing Exotica aesthetic of Martin Denny, Arthur Lyman and Les Baxter (the latter a personal favorite of Sunny—see the Modern Harmonic 2017 compilation EXOTICA). \"The Golden Lady\" (a.k.a. \"The Lady with the Golden Stockings) features an exquisite alto solo by James Spaulding. \"Watusa\" (a.k.a. \"Watusi\") became a staple in the Arkestra repertoire. \"Aiethopia\" is a remake of \"Ancient Aiethopia\" (Ethiopia), which appeared on Jazz in Silhouette.\nAlso included on this digital edition are four unreleased stereo recordings from the period: \"Images In A Mirror\" (different from the version on Jazz in Silhouette), \"Ankhnation\" (a.k.a. \"Ankhnaton\"), \"Spontaneous Simplicity,\" and \"Black Sky and Blue Moon,\" which features an unknown vocal ensemble (see personnel notes below).\n– I.C.",

The actual vocalists on these tracks might not be either group (the original Saturn LP back cover says \"Arkestra\" on \"Africa\"). Lacking session logs, any identification of vocalists on these tracks is speculative. The vocalists on \"Black Sky\" are unknown and could have been overdubbed at a date later than the original recording.\nAll titles composed by Sun Ra © Enterplanetary Koncepts (BMI) except \"Watusa\" composed by André Pitts and Terri Vanne Sherrill\nTape transfers by Michael D.

            "about": "Let's compare Sun Ra to the Grateful Dead. Seriously. Their respective artistry differs, but both were deeply committed to their music, which evolved creatively over decades and left enormous legacies. Each toured endlessly, and their fans were passionate and devoted. There are enthusiasts who boast about having seen one or the other (perhaps both?) hundreds of times, and in extreme cases following the artist's tour itinerary. Each has inspired an ad hoc industry of chroniclers. Sun Ra and the Dead staged hundreds—perhaps thousands—of performances, and it seems every gig was recorded and documented, often with the tacit approval of the artists. Rare performance recordings of each change hands among faithful collectors, because no two shows were identical.\nSun Ra has been the subject—and in some cases the victim—of the commercial release of countless live albums. If someone in the audience or at the console captured the performance on tape, it seems as if someone eventually spent time and money to package and release it in the consumer music format du jour. The Ra market is flooded with live releases, many with dismal audio. The performances were vital, the dynamics epic, the stagings spectacular. Each is worth preserving as a historic artifact. But as a pure audio listening experience, well—you had to be there.\nThe Sun Ra market has been ill-served by poor-quality live releases. Anyone whose first exposure to Sun Ra is a muddy, 200-feet-from-the-stage audience tape heralded as a \"live album\" may not be intrigued enough to seek a second listen, and could even develop an undeserving bias against the artist. While there are a number of excellent live Sun Ra albums in circulation, others of dubious legitimacy with inferior audio misrepresent the onstage excitement. Would that all Sun Ra concerts had been recorded on hi-tech equipment by professional engineers and properly mixed. Had that happened, Sun Ra would be in the pantheon of 20th Century musicians (where he belongs) and a Ra postage stamp would have been issued during the 2014 Sun-tennial.\nWhich brings us to this collection of 1988 performances at Japan's Pit-Inn. This is a stellar live recording, and history owes a debt to the engineers (named below) who captured these explosive shows. These sixteen tracks spotlight the band's telepathic unity, each player's virtuosity, and the intricacy of the arrangements. The bandleader was 74 at the time, but Sunny plays like he's in his prime. The Arkestra swings, bops, sways, and skronks through an entertaining array of Ra originals and jazz standards by or associated with Fletcher Henderson, Duke Ellington, and others. (Sunny had worked for Henderson's Chicago orchestra in the late 1940s and was a deep admirer of the legendary bandleader/arranger.)\nMost of these tracks were released in Japan in 1988 in differing (and partial) configurations on vinyl and CD. This edition includes all tracks from those releases as well as two bonus tracks. For the purposes of a digital release—which is purchased whole or in part—some editing and resequencing were applied. We have attempted to edit each number for single-track listening, while sequencing the full album as two sets for extended enjoyment. In some instances we have omitted (or faded) the audience before or after (a practice common on many of Sun Ra's own Saturn LPs).\n– I.C.",

            "about": "The Solar-Myth Approach Vol. 1\nSun Ra and His Solar-Myth Arkestra\nThe Solar-Myth Approach was first issued in 1971 as a double LP set on the French BYG/Actuel label, then repackaged as two stand-alone volumes in 1972. Founded in 1967, BYG was associated with the maverick arts journal Actuel. The label issued dozens of fascinating and groundbreaking free jazz, experimental, and psychedelic releases before a seemingly abrupt—and controversial—late-1972 bankruptcy. The pot-head pixies in the band Gong recalled that \"during the making of [our album] Flying Teapot in January 1973, the band learned that the record company had gone bust, its Paris office stripped bare, no phones working. The band was abandoned at the Manor Studios midway through the album.\" The label died without a lawful successor—but not without litigation and lawsuits.\nSun Ra had licensed or sold the Solar-Myth recordings to BYG. (The terms of the agreement are unknown because no copy could be located for review, but the distinction between license and sale has been rendered moot by subsequent events. It's even possible there was never a written agreement. See below.) In the absence of any valid successor label claim, rights to both Solar-Myth albums reverted to the artist (and later, to his heirs). However, through a series of subterfuges, a label that rose from the ashes of BYG, Charly Records, founded by one of the BYG partners, assumed ownership of countless BYG releases without any provable chain-of-title. BYG and Charly are separate and unrelated companies with one overlapping principal on their letterheads. It's possible (we're agnostic) that some artists who appeared on BYG were later signed to Charly. Gong wasn't. Neither was Sun Ra. Search online and you'll find allegations of impropriety against Charly for non-payment of royalties, false ownership claims, infringement, and illicit releases. Besides Gong, plaintiffs and accusers included Nina Simone, George Clinton, Ian McLagan, and MCA Records. A number of these complaints went to court. According to a well-known indie rocker, \"At the 2005 Ponderosa Stomp in Memphis, Syl Johnson went on a tirade from the stage about Charly putting out his music without proper authorization. His rant was so hilarious that I felt compelled to purchase the Charly CD from the merch stand after his set.\"\nSince the demise of BYG, the Solar-Myth Approach albums have been reissued without legitimacy in a series of ever worsening-quality packages in various formats. The Charly reissues were inferior to the BYG originals (and displayed different cover art), and a dreadful off-pitch, out-of phase 2-CD bootleg appeared on the Fuel label in 2001.\nOn a qualitative level, this 2020 Cosmic Myth remastering from best-available sources (tapes and discs) constitutes an upgrade. Are they perfect? Of course not—these are Sun Ra recordings. But countless audio flaws—some dating from the original sessions, others from careless mastering—have been repaired.\nStyle-wise, the albums are a grab-bag of tracks from various undocumented sessions in New York and Philadelphia in the 1960s, while some possibly date to the late 1950s when Ra and the Arkestra were based in Chicago. (Ra decamped to New York in 1960, and to Philly in 1968, though he continued to record in NYC at Variety Studios for years.) There are no specific session logs for these tracks, and an identical personnel roster appears on both Solar-Myth LPs. Ra was not a meticulous annotator of his own releases. Ever the cosmic jester, he was inclined towards fabrication and wanton \"misdirection\"; the listed players, dates, locations, even titles, are sometimes unreliable. (To paraphrase author Bob Mielke, \"Sun Ra's not for real—he's for myth!\") Ra scholars can generally identify players by style and estimate recording years and determine location by sleuthing the revolving membership of the Arkestra; in addition, arranging techniques, instrumentation, title copyrights, concert itineraries, and studio atmosphere offer clues.\nAs with many albums compiled by the bandleader from disparate sessions, there's something on the Solar-Myth albums for every Ra fan to love—and some things that casual fans will find less \"lovable.\" As we've noted before, with Sun Ra you get everything but consistency and predictability. The Solar-Myth tracks careen to extremes, styles are juxtaposed in a non sequitur fashion, and audio quality fluctuates. For a Sun Ra album, this qualifies as \"cohesive.\" Some titles have entered the Ra canon (e.g., \"Satellites Are Spinning,\" \"They'll Come Back\" \"Outer Spaceways Inc.\"), while others appear here and nowhere else (e.g., \"Realm of Lightning,\" \"The Utter Nots,\" \"The Adventures of Bugs Hunter\").\nBecause we're big fans of RODGER COLEMAN's \"Sun Ra Sundays\" blog, we'll let Rodger (from Sept. 2009) illuminate the contents of Volume 1, and we'll offer some closing observations below.\n[COLEMAN:]\n\"Spectrum\" sets the mood, with thick, dissonant chords that rise and fall over the ominous heartbeat of Ra's clavinet. Meanwhile, John Gilmore blows tightly controlled overtones on tenor, with Pat Patrick asserting angular counter-figures on baritone sax. The drummer-less texture sounds more like contemporary classical music than any kind of \"jazz.\" The following track, \"Realm of Lightning,\" features clattering clouds of trash-can percussion and blatting trombones over a hypnotic, repeated bass line. Things briefly settle down with a lovely rendition of \"The Satellites Are Spinning,\" taken at a lugubrious tempo, with June Tyson and Gilmore singing in unison over Ra's rhapsodic clavinet and some softly supportive hand drums. \"Legend\" is the centerpiece of the album, an astounding ten-minute excursion for straining trombones and frenzied oboes, with Gilmore and Ra engaged in pitched battle, Sonny attacking the clavinet with an unusually Cecil Taylor-ian aggression.\n\"Seen III, Took 4\" is another inventive Minimoog solo from 1970. By de-tuning the oscillators and with a call and response form, Ra simulates polyphony on the monophonic instrument, adding creative volume swells, filter and ring modulator effects, and ending with swooning pitch bends. \"They'll Come Back\" is a short but tantalizing composition that calls to mind both Béla Bartók and Duke Ellington with its interlude of fiercely rumbling piano and ringing, childlike celeste before a dramatic full stop and beautifully rendered coda. Volume 1 closes with \"Adventures of Bugs Hunter,\" which starts out as a groovily choogling number for Ra's funky clavinet and Boykin's rock-solid bass. But then Marshall Allen intercedes with some ear-piercing piccolo, in a deliberately contrary key and rhythm, all of which is swathed in Hunter's patented echo/reverb effect. Far out, man! A perfect ending to an adventurous LP.\n[/COLEMAN]\nThe BYG LP annotation for both volumes asserts that this material was \"Recorded at the Sun Studios, New York, 1970–71.\" Don't believe it. Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, in the massive Ra discography, The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed., publ. 2000), date the earliest tracks to 1967 and the latest to 1970. Their range is more believable than Ra's characteristic trickery, yet they added a disclaimer: \"Most of the material is obviously from New York and was recorded in 1967-1968 (some items could be even earlier). A few tracks came from the early Philadelphia period, 1969-1970. The collective personnel provided on the BYG releases was used as a guide, but trumpet and trombone credits (as usual for this period) needed correcting, Tommy Hunter was not credited on drums, and Ra's Clavinet was misspelled 'clarinet'.\"\nNote the caveat: \"some items could be even earlier.\" How much earlier?\nMichael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive believes (and we concur) that \"They'll Come Back\" (from Vol. 1) and \"Ancient Ethiopia\" (from Vol. 2) were recorded either in Chicago, or at the Choreographer's Workshop in the first years after Ra settled in New York. Compared to everything else on the Solar-Myth Approach, the tight arrangements of \"They'll Come Back\" and \"Ancient Ethiopia\" are outliers. They do not sound like anything Sun Ra produced in the late 1960s—but they do sound comparable to his arrangements from the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nReconsidering \"They'll Come Back\" in 2019, Campbell remarked, \"I’d say Choreographers Workshop 1963–1965.\"\nOther versions of \"Ancient Ethiopia\" appear on the albums Jazz in Silhouette (titled \"Ancient Aiethopia\"; recorded late 1958, issued 1959) and on The Nubians of Plutonia (titled simply \"Aiethopia\"; recorded ca. 1958–59, possibly before the Jazz in Silhouette version, and issued ca. 1966). Except for its inclusion on Solar-Myth, the tune seemingly disappeared from Ra's repertoire after he left Chicago. He neither recorded nor performed it ever again—although the Solar-Myth version, which is undated, could be an exception. Campbell, 2019: \"I don’t think Sunny would have given the intro to the S-MA version of 'Ethiopia' to [bassist] Ronnie Boykins in Chicago, and I don’t think it would have sounded quite like this if he had. The drumming’s not what we would hear on a Chicago performance, either. Not having two baritone saxes, Sunny had to use another low wind instrument. I still hear a bass clarinet on the track (check the ending); with John Gilmore leading the saxes on tenor, that says Robert Cummings was in the area. The sonics are dingy, which makes the Workshop likely.\"\nAnderson also believes that \"Realm of Lightning\" (Vol. 1) and \"The Utter Nots\" (Vol. 2) originated at Choreographer's, in 1962 and 1964 respectively. These sessions produced tracks which were issued on the Saturn albums Art Forms of Dimensions Tomorrow, and Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy. This material is pivotal in Ra's evolution away from the conventions associated with \"jazz\" and towards something more idiosyncratic and unclassifiable.\nThe historical context of two other tracks merit reevaluation. The solo Moog synthesizer tracks \"Seen III, Took 4\" (Vol. 1) and \"Scene 1, Take 1\" (Vol. 2) are listed in The Earthly Recordings as being performed on a Minimoog. Ra acquired a Mini prototype in 1970—the year the instrument was developed—from Bob Moog himself and took it on tour. The prior year Ra had visited Gershon Kingsley's New York studio and recorded on Kingsley's modular Moog; those recordings were issued on Saturn in 1970 as the album My Brother the Wind. We asked Brian Kehew, a Moog historian (who wrote liner notes for the 2017 deluxe reissue of My Brother the Wind), to review the two Solar-Myth tracks and identify which instrument Ra played. His reply: \"Sure sounds UN-like a Minimoog and VERY like the modular system. Ra plays a wider range on the keyboard than you could on a Minimoog. It's the longer keyboard of the modular system.\" As it turns out, on both volumes of Solar-Myth, Ra credits himself with playing \"Moog synthesizer\" — not the Mini. So in this one instance, it seems Ra was on the level.\nBut that's not all. According to Anderson, \"Scene 1, Take 1\" was recorded at the tape speed of 3-3/4ips, but for the original BYG LP it was—for reasons unknown—played back at 7-1/2ips. Hence, that track has always been heard at double speed. If you listen closely, at two seconds in there's a momentary voice which is clearly sped-up. The 3-3/4ips tape is too fragile for Anderson to run, but Kehew was able to convert the digital file to true speed. On this version, at four seconds in, you can hear the voice of Sun Ra at normal pitch. It's conceivable that Ra made the creative decision to speed up the piece for the album—although we cannot rule out engineer error. At any rate, here the original LP version remains as track #3 in the Vol. 2 sequence, and the true-speed version, which reflects what Ra's hands actually played, has been included on the remastered digital edition of Vol. 2 as a bonus track.\nPOSTSCRIPT: In a 2019 conversation, Ra historian/authority John Corbett explained that when Sun Ra and the Arkestra toured in the late 1960s and '70s, the bandleader often lugged along a cumbersome tape deck and a suitcase of open-reel tapes, which he would review during leisure time on the road. These tapes were a smorgasbord of styles, sessions, and band configurations from random periods in Ra's recorded history. According to Corbett, in several highly likely instances during overseas tours, Ra needed funds for return airfare or travel expenses, and would sell such tapes (or copies thereof) to European labels—a quick hand-off deal. Tape documentation could be scarce-to-non-existent, which would prompt labels to guess dates, titles, and personnel, or rely on skimpy (or fabricated) info provided by Ra. It's highly possible that BYG acquired the Solar-Myth tapes in this fashion. If so, it increases the likelihood of \"engineer error\" causing the incorrect speed of \"Scene 1, Take 1,\" as well as explaining the incongruous stylistic mix of these two albums.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "The Solar-Myth Approach Vol. 2\nSun Ra and His Solar-Myth Arkestra\nThe Solar-Myth Approach was first issued in 1971 as a double LP set on the French BYG/Actuel label, then repackaged as two stand-alone volumes in 1972. Founded in 1967, BYG was associated with the maverick arts journal Actuel. The label issued dozens of fascinating and groundbreaking free jazz, experimental, and psychedelic releases before a seemingly abrupt—and controversial—late-1972 bankruptcy. The pot-head pixies in the band Gong recalled that \"during the making of [our album] Flying Teapot in January 1973, the band learned that the record company had gone bust, its Paris office stripped bare, no phones working. The band was abandoned at the Manor Studios midway through the album.\" The label died without a lawful successor—but not without litigation and lawsuits.\nSun Ra had licensed or sold the Solar-Myth recordings to BYG. (The terms of the agreement are unknown because no copy could be located for review, but the distinction between license and sale has been rendered moot by subsequent events. It's even possible there was never a written agreement. See below.) In the absence of any valid successor label claim, rights to both Solar-Myth albums reverted to the artist (and later, to his heirs). However, through a series of subterfuges, a label that rose from the ashes of BYG, Charly Records, founded by one of the BYG partners, assumed ownership of countless BYG releases without any provable chain-of-title. BYG and Charly are separate and unrelated companies with one overlapping principal on their letterheads. It's possible (we're agnostic) that some artists who appeared on BYG were later signed to Charly. Gong wasn't. Neither was Sun Ra. Search online and you'll find allegations of impropriety against Charly for non-payment of royalties, false ownership claims, infringement, and illicit releases. Besides Gong, plaintiffs and accusers included Nina Simone, George Clinton, Ian McLagan, and MCA Records. A number of these complaints went to court. According to a well-known indie rocker, \"At the 2005 Ponderosa Stomp in Memphis, Syl Johnson went on a tirade from the stage about Charly putting out his music without proper authorization. His rant was so hilarious that I felt compelled to purchase the Charly CD from the merch stand after his set.\"\nSince the demise of BYG, the Solar-Myth Approach albums have been reissued without legitimacy in a series of ever worsening-quality packages in various formats. The Charly reissues were inferior to the BYG originals (and displayed different cover art), and a dreadful off-pitch, out-of phase 2-CD bootleg appeared on the Fuel label in 2001.\nOn a qualitative level, this 2020 Cosmic Myth remastering from best-available sources (tapes and discs) constitutes an upgrade. Are they perfect? Of course not—these are Sun Ra recordings. But countless audio flaws—some dating from the original sessions, others from careless mastering—have been repaired.\nStyle-wise, the albums are a grab-bag of tracks from various undocumented sessions in New York and Philadelphia in the 1960s, while some possibly date to the late 1950s when Ra and the Arkestra were based in Chicago. (Ra decamped to New York in 1960, and to Philly in 1968, though he continued to record in NYC at Variety Studios for years.) There are no specific session logs for these tracks, and an identical personnel roster appears on both Solar-Myth LPs. Ra was not a meticulous annotator of his own releases. Ever the cosmic jester, he was inclined towards fabrication and wanton \"misdirection\"; the listed players, dates, locations, even titles, are sometimes unreliable. (To paraphrase author Bob Mielke, \"Sun Ra's not for real—he's for myth!\") Ra scholars can generally identify players by style and estimate recording years and determine location by sleuthing the revolving membership of the Arkestra; in addition, arranging techniques, instrumentation, title copyrights, concert itineraries, and studio atmosphere offer clues.\nAs with many albums compiled by the bandleader from disparate sessions, there's something on the Solar-Myth albums for every Ra fan to love—and some things that casual fans will find less \"lovable.\" As we've noted before, with Sun Ra you get everything but consistency and predictability. The Solar-Myth tracks careen to extremes, styles are juxtaposed in a non sequitur fashion, and audio quality fluctuates. For a Sun Ra album, this qualifies as \"cohesive.\" Some titles have entered the Ra canon (e.g., \"Satellites Are Spinning,\" \"They'll Come Back\" \"Outer Spaceways Inc.\"), while others appear here and nowhere else (e.g., \"Realm of Lightning,\" \"The Utter Nots,\" \"The Adventures of Bugs Hunter\").\nBecause we're big fans of RODGER COLEMAN's \"Sun Ra Sundays\" blog, we'll let Rodger (from Sept. 2009) illuminate the contents of Volume 2, and we'll offer some closing observations below.\n[COLEMAN:]\nVolume 2 is perhaps even more intense than Volume 1, opening with \"The Utter Nots,\" another minimalist composition for maximalist Arkestra, consisting of an insistent one-note figure interspersed with blasting space chords, Clifford Jarvis pounding away on drums. A series of energetic, wide ranging solos (buttressed by Ra's crazy, out-of-tune piano) builds up cresting waves of tension and release across the track's eleven minutes, culminating in Danny Davis's achingly overblown alto clarinet. The lilting space chant, \"Outer Spaceways, Inc.,\" offers a bare minute of respite, with droning trombone and bassoon combined with Ra's twanging Clavinet while Tyson and Gilmore enticingly sing: \"If you find Earth boring, just the same old same thing/Come on sign up with Outer Spaceways, Incorporated.\" \"Scene 1, Take 1\" is another epic Minimoog solo, over eight minutes of thoughtful knob-twisting, wah-wah-ing filter effects, buzzing noise, and farting, sustained pitches. The piece ends with an almost Vangelis-like swirling fade-out. Ra turns to Clavinet solo on \"Pyramids,\" at times sounding more like a harpsichord or Spanish guitar on this moody, harmonically shiftless set-piece.\n\"Interpretation\" presents another delightful Strange Strings session, recorded in spacious and spacey stereo. Sadly, the fragile instruments were destroyed when the Arkestra's van careened off the road on the way back from their second trip to California in 1969, making this the last known recording of Ra's own \"scratch orchestra.\" Up next is a ponderous re-make of \"Ancient Ethiopia\" (originally titled \"Ancient Aiethopia\" on the 1959 Saturn LP, Jazz in Silhouette), with Allen musing on low-register flute and Ra scattering chords around the piano's tinkling, uppermost range. Volume 2 ends with \"Strange Worlds,\" a live recording from around 1969 or 1970. Ra's organ and Akh Tal Ebah's \"space dimension mellophone\" conjures up a spooky atmosphere and the music moves through various moods and feelings leading up to Tyson's solemn declamations regarding the strangeness of the world. Suddenly, big, high-tension space chords unleash torrents of squalling horn solos, Ra furiously assaulting the Gibson Kalamazoo with his fists and elbows. Then, everything stops cold. Is it live or a deft edit? Either way, it's a powerful conclusion to another mind-blowing album.\n[/COLEMAN]\nThe BYG LP annotation for both volumes asserts that this material was \"Recorded at the Sun Studios, New York, 1970–71.\" Don't believe it. Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent, in the massive Ra discography, The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd ed., publ. 2000), date the earliest tracks to 1967 and the latest to 1970. Their range is more believable than Ra's characteristic trickery, yet they added a disclaimer: \"Most of the material is obviously from New York and was recorded in 1967-1968 (some items could be even earlier). A few tracks came from the early Philadelphia period, 1969-1970. The collective personnel provided on the BYG releases was used as a guide, but trumpet and trombone credits (as usual for this period) needed correcting, Tommy Hunter was not credited on drums, and Ra's Clavinet was misspelled 'clarinet'.\"\nNote the caveat: \"some items could be even earlier.\" How much earlier?\nMichael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive believes (and we concur) that \"They'll Come Back\" (from Vol. 1) and \"Ancient Ethiopia\" (from Vol. 2) were recorded either in Chicago, or at the Choreographer's Workshop in the first years after Ra settled in New York. Compared to everything else on the Solar-Myth Approach, the tight arrangements of \"They'll Come Back\" and \"Ancient Ethiopia\" are outliers. They do not sound like anything Sun Ra produced in the late 1960s—but they do sound comparable to his arrangements from the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nReconsidering \"They'll Come Back\" in 2019, Campbell remarked, \"I’d say Choreographers Workshop 1963–1965.\"\nOther versions of \"Ancient Ethiopia\" appear on the albums Jazz in Silhouette (titled \"Ancient Aiethopia\"; recorded late 1958, issued 1959) and on The Nubians of Plutonia (titled simply \"Aiethopia\"; recorded ca. 1958–59, possibly before the Jazz in Silhouette version, and issued ca. 1966). Except for its inclusion on Solar-Myth, the tune seemingly disappeared from Ra's repertoire after he left Chicago. He neither recorded nor performed it ever again—although the Solar-Myth version, which is undated, could be an exception. Campbell, 2019: \"I don’t think Sunny would have given the intro to the S-MA version of 'Ethiopia' to [bassist] Ronnie Boykins in Chicago, and I don’t think it would have sounded quite like this if he had. The drumming’s not what we would hear on a Chicago performance, either. Not having two baritone saxes, Sunny had to use another low wind instrument. I still hear a bass clarinet on the track (check the ending); with John Gilmore leading the saxes on tenor, that says Robert Cummings was in the area. The sonics are dingy, which makes the Workshop likely.\"\nAnderson also believes that \"Realm of Lightning\" (Vol. 1) and \"The Utter Nots\" (Vol. 2) originated at Choreographer's, in 1962 and 1964 respectively. These sessions produced tracks which were issued on the Saturn albums Art Forms of Dimensions Tomorrow, and Cosmic Tones for Mental Therapy. This material is pivotal in Ra's evolution away from the conventions associated with \"jazz\" and towards something more idiosyncratic and unclassifiable.\nThe historical context of two other tracks merit reevaluation. The solo Moog synthesizer tracks \"Seen III, Took 4\" (Vol. 1) and \"Scene 1, Take 1\" (Vol. 2) are listed in The Earthly Recordings as being performed on a Minimoog. Ra acquired a Mini prototype in 1970—the year the instrument was developed—from Bob Moog himself and took it on tour. The prior year Ra had visited Gershon Kingsley's New York studio and recorded on Kingsley's modular Moog; those recordings were issued on Saturn in 1970 as the album My Brother the Wind. We asked Brian Kehew, a Moog historian (who wrote liner notes for the 2017 deluxe reissue of My Brother the Wind), to review the two Solar-Myth tracks and identify which instrument Ra played. His reply: \"Sure sounds UN-like a Minimoog and VERY like the modular system. Ra plays a wider range on the keyboard than you could on a Minimoog. It's the longer keyboard of the modular system.\" As it turns out, on both volumes of Solar-Myth, Ra credits himself with playing \"Moog synthesizer\" — not the Mini. So in this one instance, it seems Ra was on the level.\nBut that's not all. According to Anderson, \"Scene 1, Take 1\" was recorded at the tape speed of 3-3/4ips, but for the original BYG LP it was—for reasons unknown—played back at 7-1/2ips. Hence, that track has always been heard at double speed. If you listen closely, at two seconds in there's a momentary voice which is clearly sped-up. The 3-3/4ips tape is too fragile for Anderson to run, but Kehew was able to convert the digital file to true speed. On this version, at four seconds in, you can hear the voice of Sun Ra at normal pitch. It's conceivable that Ra made the creative decision to speed up the piece for the album—although we cannot rule out engineer error. At any rate, here the original LP version remains as track #3 in the Vol. 2 sequence, and the true-speed version, which reflects what Ra's hands actually played, has been included on this remastered digital edition of Vol. 2 as a bonus track.\nPOSTSCRIPT: In a 2019 conversation, Ra historian/authority John Corbett explained that when Sun Ra and the Arkestra toured in the late 1960s and '70s, the bandleader often lugged along a cumbersome tape deck and a suitcase of open-reel tapes, which he would review during leisure time on the road. These tapes were a smorgasbord of styles, sessions, and band configurations from random periods in Ra's recorded history. According to Corbett, in several highly likely instances during overseas tours, Ra needed funds for return airfare or travel expenses, and would sell such tapes (or copies thereof) to European labels—a quick hand-off deal. Tape documentation could be scarce-to-non-existent, which would prompt labels to guess dates, titles, and personnel, or rely on skimpy (or fabricated) info provided by Ra. It's highly possible that BYG acquired the Solar-Myth tapes in this fashion. If so, it increases the likelihood of \"engineer error\" causing the incorrect speed of \"Scene 1, Take 1,\" as well as explaining the incongruous stylistic mix of these two albums.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "The Soul Vibrations of Man and a companion LP, Taking a Chance on Chances (or \"… on Chancey\"?), were pressed shortly after being recorded at a November 1977 gig at Chicago's Jazz Showcase.\nConsidering the rush-release of these two albums, the mystical cover illustration for Soul Vibrations is quite elaborate, which (with a few notable exceptions) was not standard practice for Ra's private pressings during the 1970s. Most Saturn LPs appeared in blank, generic—though often hand-decorated—sleeves. The Soul Vibrations artist is unidentified.\nThere were no track titles on the Soul Vibrations disc labels, just the album title along with the cryptic \"Side A, Part I, Volume VII\" and \"Side B, Part II, Volume VII.\" The track titles were later provided by Ra discographers Robert Campbell and Christopher Trent, in consultation with trumpeter Ahmed Abdullah. If there are Soul Vibrations Volumes I thru VI, they have yet to surface. Campbell opined: \"Vol. VII just looks to me like a propitious number.\" (The label © says \"1976\" — more Ra mischief?)\nThe fraternal albums appear to have been largely segregated by composer: Soul Vibrations consists entirely of Ra originals, while Taking a Chance, except for the title track, features cover versions of many of Ra's favorite and oft-performed standards, albeit with ever-shifting arrangements. That said, these are not studio-quality albums, and flaws abound. For veteran Ra fans, the coarse audio and choppy edits will come as no surprise, nor will they obscure the idiosyncratic performances embedded in the recordings. It's a typically eclectic set: loose improv, coalescing flutes, insistent horns, and restless percussion, amid space chants, cosmic sermons, and ballads. As often with Ra, everything but consistency and predictability.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "This first-ever collection of Sun Ra Arkestra vocal recordings was issued by Modern Harmonic in 2017. The collection offers 75 minutes of Sun Ra songcraft, many sung by longtime Arkestra singer-dancer June Tyson. (The album was also issued on vinyl and CD, but the CD is currently out of stock.)\nKnown primarily for his keyboard improv and freewheeling orchestral arrangements, Sun Ra could also write such great songs as \"Space Is The Place,\" \"Nuclear War,\" and \"Interplanetary Music.\" Ra would sometimes use eerie chanting and call & response to create hypnotic moods. \"Enlightenment\" and \"Moorish Nights\" are gorgeous tunes, as pretty as anything from Tin Pan Alley. Of course, it wouldn't be Sun Ra without space age lyrics — \"Take your first step out to outer space/You're like a little baby who never walked before\" commands the future-predicting \"Walking On The Moon.\"\nRa was also a big fan of great songs from the past, and here offers soulful cover versions of \"Sometimes I'm Happy,\" the Thelonious Monk classic \"Round Midnight,\" \"Back in Your Own Back Yard,\" and the Disney tune \"Forest of No Return.\"",

            "about": "Sun Ra's Spirit of Jazz Cosmos Arkestra—the only known use of this appellation in Ra's entire catalog—performed in concert at Philadelphia's WUHY radio studios in 1978, probably in July. WUHY producer Anna Mintz, in a voiceover introduction, called the show \"one of the hottest things to happen here since Dick Clark and American Bandstand left town.\" (File under: Juxtaposition of Incongruities.)\nTaped for a broadcast series called \"All That Jazz,\" the concert was augmented with short excerpts of a Sun Ra interview in a voice-over-music format (it's dropped in at unpredictable spots). Copies of the tape have long circulated among Ra collectors in various incarnations—some seemingly complete, others abridged, some mislabeled, and a few with tunes oddly titled (e.g., \"Ark Smooth Sailing,\" and \"Drifting in D-Flat,\" neither of which are actual Ra titles). Some tapes in circulation are dated July 1978; others cite October. (July is commonly accepted.)\nIf you follow along in Campbell and Trent's The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra (2nd edition, 2000), this is item #272. Most of the info is accurate, but we can clarify a few details. ER notes, \"[An] unidentified altoist is definitely not Danny Davis or Pat Patrick; he has a notable blues feeling and is featured on 'The Shadow World' and 'Space Is the Place—and probably on 'Love in Outer Space' as well.\" ER speculated that it could have been Knoël Scott, who otherwise doesn't log a confirmed sighting in the Arkestra until one year later.\nIn her intro, Mintz identifies Arkestra members, and names Byard Lancaster on alto sax. (She neglects to mention tenor mainstay John Gilmore, who is provably on the date.) Lancaster is not listed in the ER credits for this date—in fact, he isn't listed anywhere in the book's musician index. However, Philadelphia-born Lancaster was prominent on the Philly jazz scene for years and a number of 2012 obits indicated that he played with Ra. The passing mention by Mintz had apparently been overlooked when this date was cataloged for ER. We pointed this out to Ra discographer Christopher Trent, who gave a fresh listen to the performance and reported back.\nCT: \"I’m convinced—it's Byard Lancaster on alto. I was immediately struck by the similarities to Byard’s sound on albums which I’d been listening to of late, in particular the 1979 'Documentation – The End of a Decade.' So, yes—the ‘unknown' alto solos on 'The Shadow World,' 'Space Is the Place' and 'Love in Outer Space' are, in my opinion, all Lancaster.\" Hence, this set contains the first—and thus far only—recorded instance of Lancaster as an Arkestran. Mintz also mentions a drummer named Ricky Joyce—another name that can't be found in Ra discographies. (We can't even find refs to the guy online, tho there's apparently a rock drummer with a similar name.)\nTrent added: \"Gilmore is indeed present on this gig. He has his customary featured solos on 'Lights on a Satellite,' 'Limehouse Blues,' and 'Christopher Columbus.' He's low in the mix for the first few, but better amplified on 'The Shadow World,' on which he takes the first solo—a high-register tenor, mostly unaccompanied—followed by Danny Davis, also ending unaccompanied, and then Lancaster.\"\nThe set features Sun Ra playing lots of acoustic piano. Though it was Ra's original instrument, in the mid-1960s he began incorporating more electronic keyboards, and gravitated towards any such device that came on the market (Minimoog, Rocksichord, Crumar Mainman, clavioline, Farfisa, Hohner Clavinet, etc.) through the mid-1970s. Historian Ben Young pointed out that after Ra relocated from New York to Philadelphia around 1968, he didn't have a piano in his house. However, while never abandoning electronic keys, Ra returned to the acoustic piano often in the second half of the 1970s, during which we find any number of solo piano recordings and live performances, as well as piano in the context of the Arkestra.\nThe WUHY date features Ra offering an extensive tribute to one of his musical heroes, the great (and much neglected) big band arranger Fletcher Henderson, with whom Ra had worked in Chicago during the late 1940s. Three Henderson staples are offered: \"Limehouse Blues,\" \"Christopher Columbus,\" and \"Big John's Special.\"\n\"The extended 'Christopher Columbus' is a killer version,\" notes Trent, \"with great (if slightly off-mic) Gilmore, Walter Miller, and (we now know) Byard Lancaster contributions.\"\nOn one circulating version of the tape, a track is identified as \"Drifting in D-Flat.\" However, ER calls it \"There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of),\" a work which appears on the 1979 album Lanquidity. The WUHY track sounds very different. However, the title was performed live by Ra quite extensively during this period, and he often developed radically new arrangements for existing works, occasionally to the point of rendering them unrecognizable. Trent provided some perspective: \"I think this is 'There Are Other Worlds.' The riff played by the saxophones before Michael Ray enters on trumpet sounds to me the same as sung by ensemble voices at the start of this piece on Lanquidity.\"\nWe made some minor, largely inconspicuous digital repairs to the audio, but no processing, EQ, compression, reverb, or noise reduction were applied. The full broadcast (as preserved) is here, and the original performance sequence is intact. However, because digital tracks are often purchased separately and/or listened to out of context, we have omitted applause where possible for clean starts and/or ends. We have retained fade-in applause where Ra begins playing piano before the audience stops clapping, and retained it at the end of the Fletcher Henderson pieces because it's exciting to hear the immediate audience response after these explosive performances.\n—Irwin Chusid",

            "about": "\"The Stranger,\" a radio play with musical accompaniment by Sun Ra & His Arkestra, premiered over the Pacifica radio network in the late 1960s, on a program called Mind’s Eye Theater. The exact date is unknown, but 1968 is a consensus guess (as noted in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra).\nRa’s incidental music, which is tight and atmospheric, surfaces sporadically beneath the dialog, but at no time is featured. Ra is named in the closing credits, and the additional personnel were identified by Ra discographer Robert L. Campbell.\nThe circumstances of the soundtrack recording and how Ra's involvement came about are unknown. In a passing mention of the play in his book Space is the Place: The Lives and Times of Sun Ra, biographer John Szwed notes that during this time, \"The Arkestra continued to pick up work of all sorts, in part because they could play anything, but also because they would sometimes work for almost nothing.\" The brief musical passages are not identifiable Ra compositions, and were presumably original to this project. Along with conventional acoustic instruments, Ra's notorious \"strange strings\" (around which he had recorded an entire album a few years prior) are heard to excellent effect.\nThe heyday of radio drama was the 1930s through the late 1940s, after which its popularity diminished as television claimed America's attention (and advertising dollars). \"The Stranger\" sounds like an attempt to resurrect—if not parody—the form. Unfortunately, Ra's music cannot redeem the play, which lacks any compelling appeal, even as satire. The script is flaccid, the acting sounds like an unrehearsed cold reading, and the characters are bloodless. The dialogue—some composed in rhyme—is sporadically interrupted by needle-drops from the then-ubiquitous \"Elektra Authentic Sound Effects\" LPs. The clumsy conversation contains faux profundities, such as when a female painter asserts: \"There are many essences that must form themselves upon my canvas. I would never deny them.\" Except for Ra's involvement, this play would be unremembered.\nThe audio was sonically upgraded from a best-available circulating file. Flaws exist from the original broadcast and capture, the source of which is unknown, but many artifacts have been repaired and the overall quality has been improved.",

            "about": "A quartet of rare 1965 tracks from the Sun Ra Music Archive. The early version of \"The Sun Myth,\" featuring a soundtrack of African chanting underneath the Arkestra's studio performance, appeared on the first pressing of The Heliocentric Worlds of Sun Ra, Vol. 2. However, the chant is absent from the more commonly known commercial mix of the title. In fact, before it was removed from the mix entirely, the chant was mixed lower on the album's second pressing; it could be heard, but distantly. On the third pressing — no chant! How it came to be included in the first place was presumably Sun Ra's decision, and anybody's guess why. The origins of the recording are unknown, and as to why it was removed — see previous sentence. No documentation has been found explaining the evolution of the respective mixes.\n\"Dawn\" and \"The Other Beings\" are previously unreleased, and \"Interplanetary Travelers\" was available briefly on an independent label LP to which it was licensed; that album is now out of print.\nAfter the digital release of Sun Myth (African Chant) in 2016, further research affirmed that \"Interplanetary Travelers\" had originated from the sessions for the album The Magic City, and the track was included on the definitive Cosmic Myth Records 2017 LP/CD reissue of that classic 1965 Sun Ra title.",

            "about": "Sun Ra and the Arkestra weren’t a traditional studio band, and every star in the vast galaxy of their discography reflects this. The origins of these records can be hard to pinpoint at times, but when it comes to Thunder Of The Gods, it’s a bit easier.\n“Calling Planet Earth – We’ll Wait For You” was discovered on tapes from Ra’s Universe In Blue sessions, believed to be recorded in ’71. The raucous title track and “Moonshots Across the Sky” were unearthed from the 1966 Strange Strings sessions. These previously overlooked gems were discovered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive, the world's largest private collection of Sun Ra session recordings.\nThe Modern Harmonic label, who issued this trinity on vinyl and CD, paired Ra’s sonic art with the visual art of “The Father of Modern Space Art,” Chesley Bonestell, by adapting his 1952 work ”Formation of the Earth’s Continents” on the front cover.\n\"Thanks to Modern Harmonic, in partnership with Sun Ra LLC, you can be holding an album of unreleased Sun Ra music 50 years after it was recorded! That this music survived to reach our ears after all of this time is a miraculous gift. It sounds as though it could have come from either the ancient past or the distant future, yet most perfectly, it’s the music of right now.” — Christopher Eddy (Sun Ra scholar and co-proprietor of the Sun Ra Arkive blog)",

            "about": "Sun Ra was a master of misdirection. Tape boxes wrongly labeled—whether by accident or design—are legendary among Ra archivists. One can speculate about the artist's intent or carelessness, but source misinformation abounds on Ra tape cases, album jackets, cassettes, ephemera—as well as in interviews. It's as if Ra, in furtherance of his own mythmaking, wanted to keep historians guessing.\nThis project began as a misidentified tape discovered by Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive. The 7-inch reel, which contained a live Ra solo piano performance of 11 works—some recognizable, others not—was of stellar quality, and was marked as a 1979 Carnegie Hall date. But the program on the tape did not align with known facts (e.g., titles played, concert duration) which were chronicled in a Newsday review of Ra's appearance at Carnegie in September of that year. With a prod from writer/historian Ted Gioia and further research by myself, the tape was eventually identified as a mostly unreleased July 1977 performance by Ra at a downtown NYC \"jazz café\" called The Axis-in-Soho. The venue had begun presenting weekend jazz programs in January at the Marvin Elson Gallery, 463 West Broadway. In the book Artists' SoHo: 49 Episodes of Intimate History, journalist Richard Kostelanetz recalled, \"Lacking a liquor license, [Axis] charged four bucks admission and sold cappuccino, juice, and cheesecake.\" Pianist Paul Bley and Sun Ra, among others, enjoyed bookings there.\nTwo of the works on the full 70-minute \"Carnegie\" tape matched tracks recorded at Axis and released on a 1978 Improvising Artists Inc. LP titled St. Louis Blues. (IAI was co-owned by Paul Bley and video artist, and later wife, Carol Goss.) That gave us a venue and an approximate date—and nine unreleased solo works. Several titles here appear on St. Louis Blues, but the performances are different—recorded at different sets or on other evenings. We have assigned titles to the unidentified works for purposes of publishing registration, and to distinguish these compositions from countless other untitled Ra works which overpopulate his discography. Ra performs solo on all Axis tracks, but Saturnian Queen of the Arkestra June Tyson emerges from the shadows to add vocal flourishes on \"Enlightment\" and on what is possibly the briefest version ever recorded by the artist (less than two minutes) of Ra's anthemic \"Space is the Place.\"\nWhile sorting through the Axis material, an additional small trove of unissued Ra solo piano works from the same period were discovered. Tapes which had been languishing for decades at Ra's Morton Street home in Philadelphia were being rescued by Arkestra centenarian saxophonist Marshall Allen's son, Ronnie Boyd, and passed along to me. In turn, I dispatched them to jazz historian/engineer Ben Young, an expert in vintage tape preservation and restoration. Ben can identify tape brand, stock, and year of manufacture on sight. Many of these rescued reels—caked in grime, black gunk, fuzzy green spores, mildew, and flaking emulsion—should not have been handled without hazmat gear. Ben refers to these artifacts as \"the Mold Tapes.\" Many had no boxes, plastic reels were cracked, and a few were tagged with cryptically worded adhesive strips from a Dymo Label Maker.\nOne hour-long tape captured a running session of Ra on piano, jamming with an unidentified drummer. The percussionist's style was unmistakable: it was Samarai Celestial (born Eric Walker), who accompanied Ra on two essential late-1970s Saturn albums: God Is More Than Love Can Ever Be, a trio date, and Omniverse, another Ra small-band session. Both albums had been recorded at NYC's Variety Studios in 1979. The ambience on the tape was similar to the atmosphere on both albums.\nFrom a cursory listen to the found tape, it was apparent that Ra and Celestial were rehearsing, trying to lock grooves, forging a musical bond. They weren't creating masterpieces—they were testing their chemistry, with Ra occasionally calling out directions. When the quarter-inch, quarter-track tape was flipped, Celestial had taken a break and Ra vamped four solo numbers on piano, after which Celestial returned and the jam resumed. The solo pieces were extracted and added to the projected Axis set. Same artist, roughly the same period, same city, similar feel as the Axis recordings. Two of the Variety works were easily identified: \"At Sundown\" and \"Everything I Have Is Yours,\" two 1920s relics which Ra had certainly heard countless times during his formative years. A search of the Ra discography indicated that Ra had never recorded either title. Here he even casually mumbles some of the lyrics. One of the two remaining Variety vamps was eventually identified by Tin Pan Alley sleuth Will Friedwald as another 1920s standard, \"June Night.\" The other, which couldn't be identified, even by Uncle Will, we dubbed \"Rumination,\" based on the tune's atmosphere. Apologies to the composer if he had another mood in mind.\n— Irwin Chusid, May 2024",

            "about": "UNITY, reviewed by Tim Niland at the \"Music and More\" blog\nOct. 13, 2020\nThis is an unusual and fascinating Sun Ra album with the Arkestra expanding to full big band size and committing themselves to mostly swing repertoire. This album was recorded live at Storyville jazz club in New York City during October of 1977, and it is really interesting to hear the band swing like mad, which must have silenced a lot of critics who looked down on their costumes and more free playing.\nAfter weaving gracefully through the standard “Yesterdays” things really begin to pick up steam with the inclusion of Duke Ellington’s “Lightnin” and Ra’s own “Lights on a Satellite.” But the highpoint of the recording comes when the band jumps into a couple of early jazz barnburners, “Yeah, Man” and “King Porter Stomp.” This expanded twenty member version of the Arkestra latches onto these big riffs and just doesn't let go. They get such an authentic sound that you can imagine them as a territory band blowing up towns in the midwest in the 1930’s with their massive hot jazz sound. Ra stitches together Tadd Dameron’s “Lady Bird” and the Miles Davis vehicle “Half Nelson” which have similar structures and allow the band some room to stretch out, as does a version of “My Favorite Things” that owes more to John Coltrane than Julie Andrews.\nThe program winds down with an excellent version of the Sun Ra original “Satellites are Spinning” with vocalist June Tyson leading the group through the vocal chant and then making way for an excellent improvised instrumental section. The album wraps up with a short version of Ra’s beautiful original “Enlightment” that ends the concert on a thoughtful and beautiful note.\nThis album was originally released on the Italian Horo label in 1978, and this digital reissue sounds very good, making this unique and high quality Sun Ra album widely available again.",

            "about": "Universe in Blue, a collection of undated live club performances by Sun Ra & His Blue Universe Arkestra, was issued in small-run pressings with two different LP covers on Sun Ra's Saturn label in 1972. Until now it has never been officially reissued on LP or CD.\nIn the monumental—and ever-evolving—Sun Ra discography, particularly as catalogued in The Earthly Recordings of Sun Ra, by Robert L. Campbell and Christopher Trent (2000 ed.), these tracks were believed to have been recorded \"Probably live in California. ca. August 1971.\" However, according to Michael D. Anderson of the Sun Ra Music Archive, who researched tapes in his possession, these performances were captured at the rowdy Lower East Side jazz mecca Slugs. Located at 242 East 3rd Street (between Avenues B and C), the venue was formerly a Ukrainian restaurant/bar and later a drug den before it was converted into a music club by Jerry Schultz. He initially dubbed it \"Slugs Saloon,\" until he was advised that the word \"saloon\" violated New York City ordinances. Schultz rechristened the venue \"Slugs in the Far East,\" because it was situated in a somewhat forsaken, and then-disreputable eastern Greenwich Village neighborhood. The club legally maxed out at 75 patrons, but often wedged in twice that number. Despite its legendary status as a New York jazz hotspot, Slugs is more notoriously known for a tragic 1972 incident that contributed to its demise: the fatal shooting (by his common-law wife) of young hard bop trumpet virtuoso Lee Morgan. (This tragedy is chronicled in Kasper Collin's 2016 documentary film, I Called Him Morgan, which contains dozens of interior photographs of Slugs.)\nStarting around 1966, and continuing steadily for several years while they remained residents of New York, Sunny and his band performed two sets at Slugs on Monday nights. These shows continued after the Arkestra decamped for Philadelphia around 1968. (Ra eased himself into the relocation, and did not become a full-time Philly resident until 1971.) By 1970 Ra had begun shepherding the Arkestra to Europe, but while they were in town, Slugs gigs were sporadically booked.\nBased on a number of accounts, the Slugs shows typically started around 9:00 pm and could blaze on with or without breaks until 4:00 am. The personnel fluctuated, depending on who showed up, who was hanging around and could handle an instrument, and the bandleader's divinations. These evenings were raw, unpredictable, and calamitous, and not without artistic controversy. They brought Sun Ra greater attention from the New York press and helped cement his reputation for audacious showmanship.\n---\nJ.C. Thomas, who interviewed Sun Ra for Down Beat magazine (June 13, 1968), provided an excellent vignette of the Slugs milieu:\nA dark, murky, wood-paneled pub, probably dating from the days of Maxwell Bodenheim, Slugs has a casual easy-going informality in its atmosphere that affords Sun Ra the maximum of musical freedom and “feelin’ good” that he misses so much from the early days of jazz. Here, as he has for almost every Monday night for the past 18 months, Sun Ra and his musicians “tune in, turn on, and take over.”\nThe men shamble onstage, almost single file, dressed in the wildest dreams of any upper East Side boutique—fur hats, flowing robes, African print shirts, beads and bells. Their instruments and cases spill out into the drinking area, so small is the bandstand. Sun Ra, who perhaps is the most unobtrusive leader in jazz, since he always is found at the rear of the band rather than in front, sits astride his instrumental trio of piano, clavinet, and something he calls the Spacemaster—an organ especially manufactured for him by the Chicago Musical Instrument Co. that sounds like a cross between a theremin and bagpipes. Occasionally, he will play a one-stringed instrument he says is a Chinese violin.\nHis men tune up their instruments, which represent a veritable United Nations of sources. Chinese bamboo flute, bass clarinet and bassoon, Japanese koto, African kora, oboe and English horn, Sun Harp (a small harp designed like the golden rays of the sun that gives off beautifully resonant tones)—to name a few. Percussion, too, as every man doubles on at least one drum, and two or three are not uncommon—bongos, claves, maracas, conga, gongs, bells, and enough authentic African drums to equip a tribe.\nThe audience, as heterogeneous as the music that they’ll soon hear, is quiet, respectful, and attentive. They may, however, become slightly restless during the next three hours—for that’s the usual length of a set at Slugs, as the sounds of Sun Ra segue from one composition into another without stopping. His Space Music makes almost as many demands on his audience as it does on his musicians, and it’s sometimes hard to ascertain who’s the more exhausted after a night of six solid hours of music.\n---\nThe recordings on Universe in Blue are not hi-tech; they were reportedly captured with a pair of microphones placed on or near opposite sides of the stage (resulting in a startling lo-fi stereo), and recorded on cassettes. Considering this primitive set-up, the fidelity—\"Another Shade of Blue\" excepted—is quite good. These sonic artifacts provide an intriguing glimpse of the Arkestra's repertoire and virtuosity at the close of their first decade playing in New York.\nThese recordings originated on different nights, with different lineups. The set kicks off with the title track, a soulful, blues-based organ crawl by Sunny, which segues into trumpet and sax solos. This is after-hours music, with shamanistic undertones. On the LP, this track was inexplicably faded early, then resumed as \"Part 2.\" The complete version is presented here as a single track.\nVocalist June Tyson (who joined the Arkestra in 1968) is showcased on \"When the Black Man Ruled This Land\" (titled \"Black Man\" on the LP), declaiming with fierce urgency over Sunny's space organ and Arkestral percussion. On the original Saturn LP the track faded after two and a half minutes, but the entire work—with an additional five-plus minutes—is included here for the first time.\n\"In a Blue Mood\" is a churchy Sun Ra organ recital offered with restraint, yet simmering with emotion. Ra's left hand provides a walking bass line, while a ghostly drummer is heard far off mic, mostly keeping time on the snare and ride cymbal. This track was mastered from a stereo source, the first time it has been issued in stereo.\nPrepare yourself for the next track, \"Another Shade of Blue.\" This relentless, 11 minutes-plus blues cooker is a wild ride. The audio is terrible, the playing is awesome, and it's chock full of soul. \"Another Shade …\" conveys the feel of a 3 a.m. jam session in some smoky 1940s R&B roadhouse (in stereo!). The sound was upgraded slightly from the Saturn LP, but processing cannot restore what's not there. It's a murky sonic swamp, comparable to a Velvet Underground audience tape. Fidelity aside, the spirit, intensity and chops are self-evident. The Ark wails, Gilmore burns, and the tape fades, with no indication of how long the band continued. In an alternate cosmos, it might still be in progress.\nThis digital edition contains two bonus tracks from Slugs, both from a cassette in the Sun Ra Music Archive. As with the original Universe in Blue tracks, dates and exact personnel are unknown.\n— I.C.",

            "about": "Voice of the Eternal Tomorrow is a rare slab of Saturn vinyl recorded and pressed in 1980. It offers an edited live performance of the Arkestra at New York's radical Squat Theatre. The album was also pressed and sold as The Rose Hue Mansions of the Sun, the title of one of three tracks included on the LP.\nSquat was founded in Budapest by Hungarian dissidents in the 1960s. In the 1970s a number of Squat founders were expelled from Hungary, and these political exiles relocated to New York, where they re-established the theater in a cramped storefront at 256 West 23rd Street. Besides music, Squat was known for dramatic productions (from Chekhov to conceptual absurdism), which were staged in the theater's window overlooking the 23rd Street sidewalk.\nFrom 1979 to 1982 the Arkestra gigged regularly at Squat; an unknown number of performances were recorded, a few released commercially in limited quantities with handmade covers. The Squat archives (at  SquatTheatre.com)  claim that Ra debuted there in August 1979 and performed on the premises 47 times, \"to become our most frequent guest.\" The chronicle explains that \"the fit between the Arkestra and the Squat Theatre was a natural one, as both were in essence creative communes.\"\nThe three works on this album are, as might be expected for the venue, on Sunny's radical side. The recordings are saturated with aggressive outbursts, explosiveness, and an air of confrontation and defiance. Judging from the applause, these performances were well-received. The recording fidelity is less than optimal, with distortion and a mediocre mix—but it's close enough for Garage Jazz. It could be argued that there's no way to adequately capture this orchestrated chaos in such a claustrophobic space. And yet, what remains represents history. The time, the space, the players will never again converge.\nRa performances at Squat sometimes included audience participation—one unintentionally comic incident is chronicled in John Szwed's Sun Ra biography Space is the Place. Szwed also recounts \"two nights of [Arkestra] concerts with 100 musicians jammed into the tiny space, and in order to coordinate so many musicians Sun Ra rehearsed in shifts for 24 hours straight, with different musicians and instrumental sections one after another.\"\n– I.C.",

            "about": "We Travel The Spaceways (sometimes spelled \"Space Ways\") ranks as an essential Sun Ra collection. It's brief (less than 25 minutes), and though it was recorded in three separate, unrelated sessions over a five-year-span (making it a compilation rather than an album), it's chock full of \"hits\"—or what would be chart-toppers in the perfect Sun Ra universe. Alternate versions of all seven tracks appeared on other Ra albums; a number of these titles became perennial club and concert favorites; and Spaceways contained two of Sun Ra's beloved Arkestra \"chants\"—\"Interplanetary Music\" and the title track. The recordings were made in Chicago from 1956-1961, but the album was not released on Ra's Saturn label until 1966 , long after Sunny and his band had relocated to New York and zoomed light years beyond the forms etched in the grooves of that platter.\nIn retrospect, every period in Sun Ra's career seems transitional, but 1959-1961 especially so. It was during these years that he began to musically stray from his Chicago haunts and navigate through the weightless cosmos. In the mid- and late-1950s Sunny had begun to incorporate Egyptian and Ethiopian themes into a music that already drew on American and European traditions. Like many musical pilgrims, he was creating hybrids that would decades later be trivialized with the pretentious (and Eurocentric) marketing term \"World Music.\" By 1959, Sun Ra was creating Other-World Music. Four titles on Spaceways—and arguably a fifth, \"New Horizons\"—are not of this Earth.\nIn the bebop/hard-bop periods, there was a movement from traditional pulse-driven jazz to abstract forms more suitable for concert halls than dance halls. Gunther Schuller defined Third Stream as \"located halfway between jazz and classical music.\" Figures like George Russell, Charles Mingus, and Stan Kenton pioneered the field, which had a huge impact on 1950s jazz (and on classical). Sun Ra has never been considered an exemplar of Third Stream, but clearly he was influenced—and in some ways, perhaps, liberated—by this adventurous hybrid. Then again, Sun Ra, like Ellington, was sui generis. The marketing tags never quite applied.\nSun Ra's increasingly ambitious projects in Chicago foreshadowed the New York Choreographer's Workshop period, during which he often seemed to abandon jazz altogether. But then, jazz was born on Earth. By the time We Travel the Spaceways was released, Sun Ra was an ambassador to other planets. Martians, Venusians, and denizens of distant spheres hear things differently. Some have more than two ears. Sun Ra was exploring new ways to communicate.\nA few notes on the tracks:\nAnother version of \"Interplanetary Music\" appears on Interstellar Low Ways, recorded at a different session. The Spaceways take is delivered with greater gusto. The thin audio quality of this recording exists on the tape, and every released format of this track over a half-century reflects the same limited spectrum. The performance, however, more than compensates. (The rest of the album offers richer fidelity.)\n\"Eve\" with its ternary counterparts paints a musical portrait of a beautiful, exotic temptress (perhaps luring Sunny towards a Big Apple). A version from a different session appeared on Sun Ra Visits Planet Earth.\n\"We Travel the Spaceways\" also appeared on When Sun Comes Out, but from a different session.\nDiscographer Robert Campbell wrote: \"The bizarre whirring and quacking heard at the end of 'We Travel the Spaceways' comes from a toy robot with flashing lights; John Gilmore [said] that around this time the Arkestra would release the 'robots' into the audience during their performances. The band also used mechanical 'flying saucers' as props.\"\n\"Tapestry from an Asteroid\" also appeared on The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra, recorded later in New York by Tom Wilson and released on Savoy.\n\"Space Loneliness,\" a blues that veers towards crime jazz, also appears on Interstellar Low Ways, but this version picks up the tempo a bit.\n“New Horizons” comes from the 1956 RCA studio sessions for Jazz by Sun Ra, produced by Tom Wilson and released on his Transition label.\n\"Velvet\" (a different version appears on Jazz in Silhouette) is a reversion to hard bop, and points less to where Sun Ra was going than what he was leaving. Nevertheless, over the years Sunny would periodically return to his jazz roots. He never fully abandoned traditional forms, which were an intrinsic part of his musical soul.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "When Angels Speak of Love, released in 1966 on Sun Ra's Saturn label, is a rarity, with limited pressings (150 copies, by one estimate), which were sold thru the mail and at concerts and club dates. The tracks were taped in New York during two 1963 sessions at the Choreographer's Workshop, a rehearsal space/recording den with warehouse acoustics. Ra spent countless hours at the CW from 1961 to 1964 sharpening the Arkestra during exhaustive musical huddles. John Corbett calls this \"one of the most continuous, best-documented periods of Ra's work\"; much tape from these seminal sessions has survived and been issued on LP, CD and digitally.\nFollowing the musical trajectory Ra launched shortly after his 1961 exodus from Chicago to New York, the works on When Angels Speak are less composed than directed. Despite the seemingly unbound playing, it is an orderly chaos. Ra rejected the term \"free jazz.\" (His views on freedom generally are, to put it kindly, complex; he referred to his band as \"the Ra Jail,\" explaining, \"my jail is the best jail in the world, they learn things in my jail.\") Yet there is undeniable liberation in this music. There's also, thanks to Tommy Hunter's freestyle tape reverb, a pre-psychedelic quality.\nRa biographer John Szwed observed in his book Space is the Place: \"When Angels Speak of Love was considered a bizarre record when it was heard even three years later, made more bizarre by extreme echo, horns straining for the shrillest notes possible, rhythms layered, their polyrhythmic effect exaggerated by massive reverberation (which was abruptly turned off and on). 'Next Stop Mars' is the album centerpiece, a long work which opens with a space chant, followed by Marshall Allen and John Gilmore taking chances on their horns beyond what almost any other musician would dare at that time. Sun Ra played behind them, relentlessly spinning around a single tonal center with two-handed independence, then rumbling thunderously at the bottom of the keyboard against Ronnie Boykins's bass, a clangor made heavier by electronic enhancement.\"\nWilliam Ruhlmann at AllMusic observed, \"Sun Ra's music is often described as being so far outside the jazz mainstream as to be less a challenge to it than a largely irrelevant curiosity. But When Angels Speak of Love is very much within then-current trends in jazz as performed by such innovators as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman. Walter Miller's trumpet on 'The Idea of It All,' for example, indicates he'd been listening to Miles Davis, even as John Gilmore's squealing tenor suggests Coltrane; and, on 'Ecstasy of Being,' what John Corbett calls Danny Davis' 'excruciated alto' suggests Coleman. Ra himself plays busy, seemingly formless passages that are reminiscent of Cecil Taylor. This is a Sun Ra album that is more conventionally unconventional than most, with tracks you could program next to those of his 1960s contemporaries and have them fit right in.\"\nKnown Saturn LP copies of When Angels Speak were pressed in mono (as was a CD on Evidence), but stereo versions of three tracks have surfaced. Two (the title track and an abridged version of \"Next Stop Mars\") were included on a 1989 Blast First/Restless Records release. In 2016, a stereo \"Celestial Fantasy\" was discovered in Michael D. Anderson's Sun Ra Music Archive on a session reel.\nThe mono version of \"Next Stop Mars\" clocks in at 18 minutes, but the stereo version just 12. Rather than having been cut for space constraints (Ra would have scoffed at the notion that space has constraints), the abridgement might be Ra revisionism. The bandleader was involved with the BF/RR project, having provided tapes (the whereabouts of which are now unknown). The fade is organic, occurring during a rumbling piano sustain after the band stops playing. Perhaps Ra exercised a composer's prerogative, having decided that from a vantage point of 26 years' reflection, the piece had climaxed at the 12-minute mark (or that by 1989 advanced interplanetary rocketry had helped the Arkestra more quickly reach Mars).\nWe found pitch and speed differences between mono and stereo mixes. In fact, there were pitch variations within particular versions—the mono \"Celestial Fantasy\" alters pitch in the final 40 seconds. For this digital edition, all pitch variants have been roughly normalized (if the word \"normal\" can apply to anything associated with Sun Ra). But we extend a caveat: if you're hypersensitive to pitch, don't listen to Sun Ra. We prescribe Mel Tormé.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "When Sun Comes Out was the first release on Sun Ra's Saturn label to be recorded in New York. Released in 1963, it was preceded by The Futuristic Sounds of Sun Ra, which had been recorded in Newark, New Jersey (and produced by Tom Wilson, who issued it on Savoy in 1961). When Sun Comes Out was also the first release to contain recordings set down at the Choreographer's Workshop, which served as a longtime rehearsal space for Sunny & the Arkestra. The venue would be a rich source of historic material for future albums.\nStylistically, the move to New York marked Sunny's journey beyond swing, bebop, hard bop, and R&B. This advance is abundantly reflected on When Sun Comes Out. After being neglected by fans and press in the final stages of his Chicago period, Sun Ra responded to the New York jazz community's embrace by pushing the form in new directions—often to the point that what he was playing wasn't jazz. But the only category that mattered to Sun Ra was music.\nWhen Sun Comes Out is percussion-centric, and not just as backdrops—on many tracks whatever's being hit with a stick (or palms) is on top of the mix. Sun Ra's piano, some brass, and a quartet of saxophones compete for airspace with an arsenal of drums, congas and bongos, bells and cowbells, shakers and gongs (a good deal of it handled by the reed section). In fact, the mix often defies professional engineering standards, as musical hardware that usually provides the foundation occasionally dominates the lead instruments.\nThe horns are more aggressive than in the Chicago years, Sunny experiments with atonality on the keyboard, and on many tracks he dispenses with conventional structure. The Arkestra here includes four saxophonists (John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, Pat Patrick, and newcomer Danny Davis, then just 17), who take liberties to extend the instrument's vocabulary, their solos often independent of the rhythm bed. Sun Ra was traversing the universe, and there's a lot of space out there. On this album the explosive drummer Clifford Jarvis makes his recording debut with the Arkestra, a relationship that would extend on and off for a decade and a half. There's also a fun ensemble vocal—identified as having been performed by \"Arkestra Unit\"—on a remake of \"We Travel the Spaceways.\"\nThis remastered edition includes a number of sonic treats:\n• The complete version of the opening track \"Circe\" (featuring wordless vocals by Theda Barbara); the Saturn release omitted most of the introductory gong sequence (by Tommy Hunter).\n• The LP's side two tracks (here 6 – 9) in stereo from the master tape. All known pressings of the LP were in mono.\n• The previously unreleased part two of the percussive composition \"The Nile,\" featuring a haunting flute solo by Marshall Allen.\n• The complete \"Dimensions in Time,\" recorded at the Choreographer's Workshop around this time but released only in an abridged version (and titled \"Primitive\") on the mid-1970s hybrid release Space Probe.\n– I.C.",

            "about": "The composition \"I Roam the Cosmos\" has never before appeared on a commercial release. (It should not be confused with \"We Roam the Cosmos,\" an entirely different Sun Ra title which has been issued.) The massive Campbell-Trent Sun Ra discography contains only two references to this title: a Voice of America monophonic tape of a 1973 performance at Carnegie Hall; and an audience tape of a 1974 performance at Hunter College. This recording is neither—it's clearly a soundboard recording and it's in extreme stereo.\nThe cosmo-drama begins with June Tyson reciting the lyrics to \"Astro Black\" over the dirge-like \"Discipline 27-II\" groove; it then segues into call-and-response declamations between Sun Ra and Tyson as the Arkestra sustains the languid \"D27-II\" rhythm for close to an hour, punctuated by choruses of horns. Seemingly switching identities—all in the first person—Ra intones cosmic philosophy, conjures enlightenment, proffers myths, and delivers dire forecasts, with Tyson echoing and dramatizing each invocation.\nBased on tape box markings, the performance took place in July 1972 at the Lower East Side jazz mecca Slug's Saloon, located on East 3rd Street, where from the late 1960s to the early '70s Ra and the Arkestra frequently performed all-night sets. The personnel fluctuated, depending on who showed up, who could play (or capably fake) an instrument, and the bandleader's divinations. These legendary evenings were raw and unpredictable, often calamitous, and not without artistic controversy. They brought Sun Ra to the greater attention of New York jazz habitués and advanced his reputation for audacious showmanship. The 1972 album Universe in Blue contained performances recorded there, and many Slug's tapes survive in the Sun Ra Music Archive collection. The audio fidelity, room tone, channel separation, and mic artifacts on \"I Roam the Cosmos\" are very similar to those on Universe.\nThese recordings are not hi-tech; they were reportedly captured with a pair of microphones placed on or near opposite sides of the stage. Considering this primitive set-up, the fidelity is quite good, and the raw cosmic soul of this Sunny-June duet is undeniable.\n– I.C.",

This recording is neither—it's clearly a soundboard recording and it's in extreme stereo.\nThe cosmo-drama begins with June Tyson reciting the lyrics to \"Astro Black\" over the dirge-like \"Discipline 27-II\" groove; it then segues into call-and-response declamations between Sun Ra and Tyson as the Arkestra sustains the languid \"D27-II\" rhythm for close to an hour, punctuated by choruses of horns. Seemingly switching identities—all in the first person—Ra intones cosmic philosophy, conjures enlightenment, proffers myths, and delivers dire forecasts, with Tyson echoing and dramatizing each invocation.\nBased on tape box markings, the performance took place in July 1972 at the Lower East Side jazz mecca Slug's Saloon, located on East 3rd Street, where from the late 1960s to the early '70s Ra and the Arkestra frequently performed all-night sets. The personnel fluctuated, depending on who showed up, who could play (or capably fake) an instrument, and the bandleader's divinations. These legendary evenings were raw and unpredictable, often calamitous, and not without artistic controversy. They brought Sun Ra to the greater attention of New York jazz habitués and advanced his reputation for audacious showmanship. The 1972 album Universe in Blue contained performances recorded there, and many Slug's tapes survive in the Sun Ra Music Archive collection. The audio fidelity, room tone, channel separation, and mic artifacts on \"I Roam the Cosmos\" are very similar to those on Universe.\nThese recordings are not hi-tech; they were reportedly captured with a pair of microphones placed on or near opposite sides of the stage. Considering this primitive set-up, the fidelity is quite good, and the raw cosmic soul of this Sunny-June duet is undeniable.\n– I.C.",

The recordings spawned two albums, the celebrated 'Space Is The Place' and 'Discipline 27-11' which would remain its rather mysterious occult twin. This official reissue was remastered from original tapes and was released for Record Store Day 2017.",

            "about": "In the years leading up to 1971, Sun Ra wrote many compositions and poems specifically inspired by the ancient African Kingdoms and many others with associated mythological and heliocentric connotations. As such, a visit to Egypt and the opportunity for the Arkestra to play there was a matter of necessity. Ra’s first ever concerts outside of the US had occurred in late summer and autumn of 1970 with performances in France, Germany and the UK and a second European tour was arranged for late 1971. At the end of that second tour, Ra caught wind of cheap flights from Denmark to Cairo.\nThese releases comprise recordings made by Arkestra member Thomas “Bugs” Hunter made in December 1971 in the streets around the Mena House Hotel, Giza, from a concert held at the house of Goethe Institute ex-pat Hartmut Geerken in Heliopolis, from a live Cairo TV channel broadcast and a concert at the Ballon Theatre in Cairo. Ra subsequently edited the three LPs of the ‘Live In Egypt’ series for release on his Saturn record label and its affiliated twin, Thoth Intergalactic: ‘Dark Myth Equation Visitation’, ‘Nidhamu’ and ‘Horizon’.\nThese three albums are now reissued for the first time individually in their original artwork and all tracks are remastered from the original tapes.",

            "about": "Strut follow up their hugely successful Marshall Allen-curated ‘In The Orbit Of Ra’ compilation with a newly curated set from the immense 125 LP back catalogue of jazz maverick, DIY philosopher and self-professed member of an “angel race”, Sun Ra. ‘To Those Of Earth... And Other Worlds’ is a hand- picked selection from BBC 6Music DJ Gilles Peterson, long-time champion of Ra’s music and the UK’s leading tastemaker for jazz-based sounds. It serves as perhaps the best introduction yet to the music of Sun Ra for a whole new generation of converts.\nSun Ra was a one-off in the history of jazz. As author Robert L. Campbell describes, “He claimed to be the last of the swing band leaders, yet dosed classic songs with LSD. He wrote poetry about the “coming space age” and claimed to be a citizen of Saturn. He dressed himself and his band in gold-lamé and lectured on the Creator’s message to the cruel and deceitful Earthman. He named himself after an Egyptian God. Was this guy for real? Sun Ra was very much for real.”\nFor the CD version, Peterson picks personal favourites, classics and unreleased tracks and weaves them into a flowing piece across 2CDs, showcasing the incredible variety of Ra’s work. Alongside the familiar tones of ‘Love In Outer Space’, the modal classic ‘Sleeping Beauty’ and a heavy version of ‘We Travel The Spaceways’, he brings in the off-kilter 1950s doo-wop of ‘Dreaming’, a 45 given to him personally by the late John Peel, alongside an unreleased 1987 bossa take on ‘Astro Black’, the experimental dub ambience of ‘Adventure-Equation’ and the defiant anthem, ‘Blackman’.",

            "about": "1977 was a transitional time for jazz enigma and self-proclaimed member of an “angel race“, Sun Ra. During the Summer of 1976, he had stormed Montreux and toured West Africa with one of the greatest of his full-sized Arkestras before embarking on occasional solo concerts for the first time, emphasising his prowess at the piano. Although he had always played the blues within Arkestra sets, he now summoned up the rolling tradition of blues piano, recalling Otis Spann, Avery Parrish, stride and ricky-tick styles.\nHe made two solo albums for Paul Bley’s Improvising Artists label (’Solo Piano’ and ’St. Louis Blues’) before travelling to Rome. For the concert, featured here, Ra brought in drummer Luqman Ali, who had been part of the Arkestra during the band’s early Chicago years, and vocalist Thomas Thaddeus aka Eddie Thomas. Thomas was a percussionist, dancer and “incense dude“ with the Arkestra throughout the late ‚70s period. He would appear again on Ra’s ’Lanquidity’ album for Philly Jazz in ’79.\nDuring this intimate concert, Ra takes us through piano and synthesizer renditions of Arkestra staples like ’Love In Outer Space’, ’Space Is The Place’ and ’Calling Planet Earth’ but also explores a selection of jazz standards. Among them, we hear the first ever released Ra version of the 1930s staple ’I Cover The Waterfront’ alongside a dissonant version of ’Sometimes I Feel Like A Motherless Child’ and ’St. Louis Blues’. Ra’s ties to Italy would continue the following year as he recorded three acclaimed albums for Horo Records, run by filmmaker turned label owner, Aldo Sinesio.\nFollowing 2014’s Marshall Allen compilation, ’In the Orbit Of Ra’ and 2015’s Gilles Peterson-curated ’To Those Of Earth... And Other Worlds’, Strut and Art Yard join forces once more for the first release anywhere of ’In Some Far Place: Roma ’77’. Recorded direct from the sound board and mastered from first generation reel to reel tapes.",

            "about": "Strut present the definitive edition of Sun Ra’s classic ‘Lanquidity’ album from 1978 with brand new 4LP box set and 2CD editions, featuring the widely distributed version of the album alongside alternative mixes by Bob Blank originally released in limited quantities for a 1978 Arkestra gig at Georgia Tech. Both versions of the album are cut loud at 45 rpm over 2LPs each.\nRecorded overnight at Bob Bank’s Blank Tapes on 17th July 1978 after the Arkestra had appeared on Saturday Night Live, the album is unique in the Ra catalogue. “Most critics felt that it was more of a fusion-inspired record,” explains Michael Ray. “As the name suggests, the album is liquid and languid.” Bob Blank continues, “Musically, it was very ad hoc and freeform. There were horn charts but most tracks came out of improvised jams. Sun Ra just did his thing.”\nComprising five effortlessly fluid pieces, the album eases in with Lanquidity. Danny Ray Thompson remembers, “This was one of Sun Ra’s on-the-spot compositions. It is almost like an Ancient Egyptian Stargazing Ceremony, mapping out the stars and the planets.” Where Pathways Meet is “Sun Ra’s funky version of an Egyptian march. Pharaoh is sending his troops off to fight and this is his pep-talk!” continues Thompson. “The music seems to take different pathways but still converges.” The loping groove of That’s How I Feel, features the reflective trumpet lines of Eddie Gale with solos by John Gilmore and Marshall Allen: “Marshall comes in with that snake charming oboe.” Says Thompson. The funky Twin Stars Of Thence weaves around Richard Williams celebrated elastic bassline while the haunting closer, There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of), is pure “space music.” The poet Mama Nzinga described it as ‘The essence of light. Spirit takes a ride inside the deep dark space of just being.”\nRecorded overnight at Bob Bank’s Blank Tapes on 17th July 1978 after the Arkestra had appeared on Saturday Night Live, the album is unique in the Ra catalogue. “Most critics felt that it was more of a fusion-inspired record,” explains Michael Ray. “As the name suggests, the album is liquid and languid.” Bob Blank continues, “Musically, it was very ad hoc and freeform.

            "about": "For more than two decades, the disciple that has most visibly carried on Sun Ra Arkestra’s legacy and sound is their musical director, alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, the iconic fire breather and life force that restored the Arkestra’s vitality in the massive vacuum left by Ra and John Gilmore’s death in the ‘90s. Allen turned 98 in 2022 and, as evidenced by Living Sky, his influence and leadership remain undiminished. Marking the Arkestra’s first new recording since their 2021 Grammy-nominated album Swirling, Living Sky was recorded on June 15, 2021 at Rittenhouse SoundWorks in Philadelphia and features a total of nineteen musicians, including a strings section. It was mixed and mastered by three-time Grammy winner Dave Darlington (Eddie Palmieri, Brian Lynch, Wayne Shorter).\nLiving Sky includes the first instrumental recording of Ra’s “Somebody Else’s Idea,” originally recorded in 1955 and again in 1970 for proper release on 1971’s My Brother The Wind, Vol II. Without June Tyson’s fierce vocal presence, “Somebody Else’s Idea” feels more measured, allowing for the hovering harmonic movement to glide into the foreground with the horns modulating their volume and presence in each cycle and bringing in new details, whether it be the mewling trumpets of Michael Ray and Cecil Brooks or the seeking sound flurries blow by Allen on Electronic Valve Instrument.\nThe Arkestra’s renewed brilliance is thanks in part to the singing of Tara Middleton, the true heir to Tyson, who plays violin and flute in the album. With Living Sky the Arkestra eschew the human voice, creating cosmic tones only with their instruments. The repertoire includes pieces of more recent vintage penned by Allen, complementing a variety of classic material that take on a decidedly more mellow hue in this context. The album opens with “Prelude in A Major,” Ra’s elaboration of the Frédéric Chopin miniature that previously appeared on only a few live recordings. Special Arkestra harmonies emanate from “Marshall’s Groove,” a spacey blues by Allen that ramps up patiently, like flames gingerly lapping at a sonic cauldron until an inferno engulfs the pot stoked by the swinging groove of drummer Wayne Anthony Smith Jr. Allen temporarily sets aside his alto in favor of the kora on his “Day of the Living Sky,” where his chiming chords open up like a sunrise welcoming the gurgle of hand percussion, meandering flute, and muted low brass crying in the far distance.\nThe album concludes with a pair of tuneful ballads that inject an uncertain optimism and beauty into the proceedings. Allen’s gorgeous “Firefly” provides the saxophonist with a lush platform for an extended solo toggling between pleading cries and ecstatic hollers while clearing improvisational space for Scott, veteran French horn maestro Vincent Chancey, trombonist Adriene G Davis, tenor saxophonist Nasir P. Dickenson, and a three-way string conversation between Middleton, Gwen Laster, and Melanie Dyer. The album’s hopeful vibe embraces a leap of faith with a new spin on “When You Wish Upon a Star,” a long-time feature in the Arkestra’s rep, where Allen offers a testimonial that’s anything but starry-eyed.\nFor decades listeners have looked to Sun Ra’s Arkestra for outward bound possibilities in music that grapples with earthly mayhem by embracing other galaxies. Yet their music has always been grounded by the human spirit. In this first new recording since the pandemic bandleader Marshall Allen and company give us something we can hold onto, an instrumental album rich in spirituality guiding us through the unknown yet again.",

            "about": "“Sun Ra said he came from Saturn, because white America treated him like an alien, like a creature from outer space, so he became one, an anarcho-emperor of the fantastic, who made it to the moon before America or Russia, because the moon was nowhere near as far out as he could really go.“ – Paul Morley\nStrut and Art Yard join forces for a special release to mark what would have been Sun Ra’s 100th birthday with ’In The Orbit Of Ra’, a new collection presented by the longest serving member of the Arkestra and current bandleader, Marshall Allen. Bringing together Ra highights from over 25 years of music, the album is the first internationally released compilation to provide an introduction to the music of Sun Ra, mastered from the original tapes with extended and unreleased tracks.\nIn addition to the track selection, the release features recollections and contributions from some of the core Arkestra line-up including Marshall Allen, Michael Ray, Knoel Scott and Danny Ray Thompson. For the music, the selection takes us through the huge variety and intricacy of the Arkestra’s work covering the ‘60s to early ‘80s, from the celestial blues of ‘Spontaneous Simplicity’ and ‘Plutonian Nights’ to the urgent jazz of ‘Rocket Number Nine Take Off For Planet Venus’ and ‘Dance Of The Cosmo Aliens’. The album features an exclusive previously unreleased Sun Ra track from the Art Yard archives, the acoustic ‘Trying To Put The Blame On Me’ recorded live in Rome in 1977, along with a previously unreleased Part 1 of ‘Reflects Motion’ from 1962 and an unheard extended version of ‘Island In The Sun’ from the late ‘60s.\n‘In The Orbit Of Ra’ is released on 2CD, 2LP and digital formats. Physical formats feature full interview with Marshall Allen along with rare photos by Val Wilmer.",

            "about": "Strut and Art Yard present another exclusive from the vast catalogue of cosmic jazz pioneer Sun Ra: a previously unreleased radio session most likely recorded at the WXPN FM radio studios in Philadelphia, 1974-5.\nThis newly discovered session features a new version of Ra’s earlier ‘Island In The Sun’, a romping, raucous rendition of ‘Unmask The Batman’ and the first studio recording of ‘I’ll Wait For You’ There is no bass player on the sessions and Ra’s left hand beats out a rhythmic bass pattern on the piano. All tracks are remastered directly from the original tapes. The album package features a newly commissioned painting by legendary Bristol urban artist Guy Denning and new sleeve notes by Paul Griffiths.\nRecently discovered in the Sun Ra archive, the recording forms part of a series of sessions that Ra and the Arkestra recorded for WXPN-FM between 1974 and 1980. The ‘Antique Blacks’ album was recorded there in ’74. Based on the campus of The University of Pennsylvania, WXPN’s station manager Jules Epstein and music director Russ Woessner were instrumental in the exposure and recording of The Arkestra in their broadcast production studios. Geno Barnhart, founder of The Empty Foxhole concert collective, Jules and Russ broadcast an on-going series of jazz concerts covering a wide spectrum. The Arkestra performed at The Foxhole in Philly many times from 1974.",

            "about": "A previously unreleased Sun Ra concert from Amiens, France in 1973. At times intense, ritualistic and visceral, the recording features the glistening ‘Lights On A Satellite’ featuring the spiritual tenor sax of John Gilmore and a rare instrumental version of ‘Love In Outer Space’.\nThose filing into the city’s Maison de la Culture that day would have little idea of the intense, visceral experience that awaited them. “Sun Ra’s use of the Arkestra as his instrument in an onslaught of sound, colour and movement stimulated and even shocked the senses and the shakras of audience participants onto a higher plane of spirit consciousness,“ explains the Arkestra’s Knoel Scott. On Side 1, the session kicks off with the theatrical overture, ’Enlightenment’ as Sun Ra and vocalist June Tyson invite the audience to “be of our space world“. Ra then moves into a rare instrumental version of ’Love In Outer Space’,\ntransforming the perennial Arkestra classic into a raw, ritualistic experience: “this was a vehicle for the Arkestra’s space dancers. Close your eyes and imagine them writhing across the stage in celestial homage,“ explains Scott.\nSide 2 of the album opens with the glistening ’Lights On A Satellite’, a feature for the spiritual tenor sax of John Gilmore, playing in unison with trumpeter Kwame Hadi. Closing track, the epic, chaotic, anxious ’Discipline 27-II / What Planet Is This’ moves from abstract, freeform keyboard work from Sun Ra to a walking groove as Sun Ra and June Tyson take a thinly veiled psychedelic swipe at life on earth: “If this is a planet of life, why do people die here? “ Following 2014’s landmark compilation presented by Marshall Allen, ’In the Orbit Of Ra’, Strut and Art Yard join forces once more for the first release anywhere of ’Planets Of Life Or Death’.",

            "about": "Strut present a new definitive collection of singles released by jazz maverick Sun Ra during his Earth years, spanning 1952 to 1991. Released prolifically during the 1950s and more sporadically thereafter, primarily on the Saturn label, the 45s offer one-off meteorites from Ra’s prolific cosmic journey, tracing the development of his forward-thinking “Space-Bop” and his unique take on jazz and blues traditions which sounded unlike anything else from the period. As with his LPs, most 45s were only pressed in small runs and were sold at gigs and have since become extremely rare and sought after. Some have only been discovered in physical form in recent years; some were planned and pencilled but allegedly never made it to vinyl and some appeared as one-off magazine singles and posthumous releases.\n‘Singles’ will be released in various formats across two release dates. All formats feature fully remastered tracks, rare photos, poster artwork, extensive sleeve notes by Francis Gooding, an interview with Saturn Records founder Alton Abraham by John Corbett and detailed track by track and session notes by Paul Griffiths. The 45s box sets each feature a hardboard flip top box containing 10 x 45s in their original artwork along with a bound 28pp booklet.\nRelease dates and formats:\nNovember 25th 2016:\n- all-encompassing 3CD and digital versions covering Ra’s full output from 1952-1991\n- 3LP set Volume 1 covering 1952-1961\nDecember 9th 2016\n- 10 x 45 box set Volume 1 covering 1952-1961 (limited to 500 copies)\nMarch 2017:\n- 3LP set Volume 2 covering 1962-1991\n- 10 x 45 box set Volume 2 covering 1962-1991 (limited to 500 copies)",

            "about": "Strut & Art Yart present a new definitive collection of singles released by jazz maverick Sun Ra during his Earth years, spanning 1952 to 1991. Released prolifically during the 1950s and more sporadically thereafter, primarily on the Saturn label, the 45s offer one-off meteorites from Ra’s prolific cosmic journey, tracing the development of his forward-thinking “Space-Bop” and his unique take on jazz and blues traditions which sounded unlike anything else from the period. As with his LPs, most 45s were only pressed in small runs and were sold at gigs and have since become extremely rare and sought after. Some have only been discovered in physical form in recent years; some were planned and pencilled but allegedly never made it to vinyl and some appeared as one-off magazine singles and posthumous releases.\n'Singles' will be released in various formats across two release dates. All formats feature fully re-mastered tracks, rare photos, poster artwork, extensive sleeve notes by Francis Gooding, an interview with Saturn Records founder Alton Abraham by John Corbett and detailed track by track and session notes by Paul Griffiths. The 45s box sets are limited to 500 copies, and each features a hardboard flip top box containing 10 x 45s in their original artwork along with a bound 28pp booklet.\nAll orders including a 5 ounce Natural Cotton Shopper.",

            "about": "Strut present the final instalment in their series of reissues of Sun Ra’s historic recordings in Egypt with The Sun Ra Arkestra meets Salah Ragab in Egypt plus the Cairo Jazz Band, originally released on Greek label Praxis in 1983.\nSalah Ragab first encountered the Arkestra at a concert at the house of Goethe Institut ex-pat Hartmut Geerken during the Arkestra’s first visit to Cairo and Heliopolis in December 1971 and, although Ra and Ragab did not meet in person on that occasion, they did meet and bond together when Ra returned to Egypt in 1983, resulting in these recordings. The Arkestra had been touring Europe in March 1983 and made their way to Cairo, playing a number of concerts during April at the Il Capo / Il Buco venue before recording the two superb studio versions of Ragab compositions, ‘Egypt Strut’ and ‘Dawn’, at El Nahar Studios in Heliopolis in May, featuring Salah Ragab on congas.\nKostas Yiannoulopoulos, organiser of the Praxis festival in Greece, released the recordings as the A-side of this album, with three tracks by Salah Ragab and the Cairo Jazz Orchestra on Side B. ‘Ramadan’ and ‘Oriental Mood’ were first heard on the Cairo Jazz Orchestra album Egypt Strut released in 1973 while ‘A Farewell Theme’, received its very first release on this record, written following the death of Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1970; the piece was played at the much-loved President’s funeral.\nThis first ever official reissue of the album features previously unseen photos and memorabilia alongside brand new liner notes by Hartmut Geerken and Paul Griffiths. The album is released in its original artwork and is fully remastered by Technology Works.",

            "about": "The planets align as the mighty Sun Ra Arkestra, under the direction of the maestro Marshall Allen, are releasing their first studio album in over twenty years, ‘Swirling’.\n“We truly hope that this recording brings much joy to a planet which is so deeply in need of a spirit sound and vibration,” states saxophonist Knoel Scott. “We hope it contributes to a change in the ominous direction of man’s journey through the cosmos.”\n“This new release is the Arkestra’s love offering to the world,” concludes Marshall Allen. “Beta music for a better world.”\nRecorded at Rittenhouse Soundworks in Philadelphia, the new recording represents the continuation of a heartfelt rebirth of the Arkestra under Allen’s guidance since Sun Ra left the planet in 1993, gaining new generations of followers from their regular touring across the globe. With a big band line-up featuring long-standing Arkestra members including Danny Ray Thompson (RIP), Michael Ray, Vincent Chancey, Knoel Scott, Cecil Brooks, Atakatune (RIP), Elson Nascimento and Tyler Mitchell, the album is a full-blooded celebration of Sun Ra’s legacy.",

            "about": "Listening to the opening of Sun Ra ‘Live in Paris’ 1971 calls to mind a quote from the Musicians Psalm.\n[Psalm 151]\n‘Praise Him with the Cymbals, the High sounding cymbals.’\nAs all events within the African Diaspora commence with the proclamation of the Drum, this analogy is an excellent example of the use of symbolism; orchestrated by Sun Ra. The praise of the Most High reflecting Sun Ra’s ever constant homage to the Creator. The Oration of the Drums speaks to the origins of what playwright Amiri Baraka (Leroi Jones) referred to as Great Black Music; Drum legend Lex Humphries with Danny Thompson on bongos, John Gilmore on timbales herald the entrance of Sun Ra, on Farfisa organ. The short violent bursts of sound echoing the crack of the whip, the shots through the woods by slave trackers bounty hunters and terrorists in white robes (sometimes blue uniforms) which savaged the communities of African Americans throughout the 19th and most of the 20th Century. This concert took place just three years after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King when thought of a Black American President was nonexistent, at the furthest reaches of improbability despite congresswoman Shirley Chisolm’s 1972 bid which was considered merely symbolic. Today. The shots ricocheting from within … with black on black crime, unemployment and lack of education the … manifestation of a socio-physiology full of trauma, self hate and apathy … fuelled by a multi-media platform of disrespect, caricature and humiliation. Each step forward mired in the mud of intolerance. Look at how Google allowed themselves to be used to globally disrespect the first African American First Lady; what message was sent to the African American community and the world at large? THIS is the backdrop of the Music of Sun Ra; the struggle continues into the 21st Century. The clarion call of Sun Ra as relevant today as it was Fifty years ago; this is what gave birth to Sun Ra’s statement SPACE IS THE PLACE both literal and allegorical: thoughts, ideas, equations and constructions outside the petty bigotry, cruelty and inhumanity of MAN.\n‘What do you do, when you know, that you know, that you know that your Wrong; you’ve got to Face the music … you’ve got to listen to the Cosmo sound.’\n[ Sun Ra, 1988 ]\nFollowing those shots we, hastily depart with Sun Ra at the controls of the Farfiza electric keyboard. The plethora of sounds (reminiscent of Space is the Place theme of Sun Ra’s 1964 movie and music) call for transport out of a world stricken with antebellum apartheid, psycho-social trauma, discrimination and degradation into a mythocracy of omni-being – the lift off toward outer space in allegorical departure from ‘this bitter earth’ onto the planes of cosmic splendour and delight – an entry through the Door of the cosmos to the Omniverse – a place of vast and endless possibilities – the vehicle? The Intergalactic JAZZ of Sun Ra and His Arkestra.\nThe raga like pulse of ‘Discipline 27 A’ mirroring (in allegorical context) the journey of the Amistad (slave ship liberated by its captives off the seas of Cuba and navigated to US, where they were eventually freed and returned to Sierra Leone). A parallel course with the tremendous need of African Americans for an alternative reality i.e. an alter-destiny.\nThe Ra solution: the transmolecularization of African Americans to Outer Space (beam me up, Scotty). Personal note: the only ‘transporters’ which work are music, dance, art, prayer and meditation (Sun Ra told us this night and day, but it is for each individual to internalize and actualize this DISCIPLINE, this truth, within his or herself).\nThe Arkestra charts its multirhythmic journey through the stratosphere of dissonant polyphony, lead off by the alto sax of Danny Davis, joined in tandem with present Arkestra Maestro Marshall Allen. The entire Arkestra reed section become the colours brushed from the palette of the Arkestra, painting pictures of the Omniverse as the good ship RA sets sail … across the sea … of Immortality … Toward the Last possibility … Enlightenment. Love in Outer Space speaks directly to the Joy of self-realization, achieved through a conscious connection with the Universe.\n‘The sound is thought of enlightment, the fiery truth of Enlightment, vibrations sent from the space world, are of the starry, cosmic dimensions.’\nThe vehicle? The Drum. The medium? Dance. Imagine … Visualize Sun Ra strutting the stage in Splendour – the reincarnate of Pharaoh. June Tyson, tall, Ebony, elegant, and regal, Sun Ra’s Nefertitti, gliding across the stage, Replete in flowing robes and sequined garb – a space age Josephine Baker I Katherine Dunham I Eartha Kitt bringing the dances of Cotton Club I Harlem into the Space Age. The Arkestra’s Drums and percussion represent the many languages and tongues of the African Diaspora (which will, one day, speak as one). As the Arkestras rhythms undulate, anchored by Master Drummer Disciple Jac Jacson on his Ancient Egyptian Infinity Lightning Wood Drum, they conjure Olatunji’s Drums of Passion or even the Bembe of Afro-Cuba. Not surprisingly, as Marshall, Pat and Danny frequently worked with the Nigerian Master Drummer (when Sun Ra wasn’t looking (smile). During the seventies and eighties all Arkestra members doubled on African and lor miscellaneous percussions. Each member from a different state representing another tribe yet melding into the common language off struggle and liberation of mind, spirit and body under the guidance of Sun Ra.\n‘Love in Outer Space’ develops into a montuno not unlike the Afro-beat of Nigerian legend Fela Kuti (who would call Sun Ra ‘Father’ when the Sun Ra and His Arkestra were invited to the 1977 FESTAC in Nigeria) as Sun Ra unfurls an extended keyboard accompaniment and solo full of rhythmic interplay amidst the dense polyrhythm of the Arkestra’s percussions.\nThe Arkestra returns to another variation on ‘Discipline 27’? Which mayor may not have another number (as Sun Ra wrote over 100 Disciplines alone) with the Great Pat Patrick or Danny Thompson playing an incredibly effective counter melody quite similar to the muscular lines and rhythm of Fe la’s Egypt 80 Baritonist (now under the direction of Sean Kuti) propelling the Arkestral reed section with contrapuntal lines and riffs. After trumpeter Kwame Hadi preaches on his horn, Sun Ra renders a magical Fela like sermon on the keyboard before the Arkestra horns bring in a wonderfully polyphonic theme, one of the many Disciplines I believe.\nThe splendid voice of June Tyson leads the Arkestra toward a mantra as she respectively narrates Sun Ra’s proclamation, ‘Somebody Else’s Idea’ (also known as Ah-ah). As the Arkestra weaves through the venue we hear the Great John Gilmore set the Sun Ra rhythm on the drums: Sun Ra’s Concert Master setting the proper groove.\nThe Arkestra chants, ‘Somebody else’s idea of somebody else’s world, is not my idea of things as they are’ throughout the venue, joined by Sun Ra himself at the microphone, establishing clearly that this song reflects His exact sentiment and world view. Drawing the first segment of Live in Paris 1971 to a fine decrescendo and pause.\nLive in Paris continues with Sun Ra’s crowd pleaser ‘Watusi.’ His composition giving full reign to the Arkestra as an African Drum Choir fully featuring his array of phenomenal Dancers, and percussionists; exorted by the Fire Eater Math Samba; Imagine three angels of Dance; June Tyson, Efay Tayo, and Hazoume writhing across the stage with leaps, turns, and twists. The epitomy of’ Angels and Demons at Play’ in mythic delight – marionettes to the bidding of the Ra, contortioning in supersonic speed in duet with the dazzling array of contrapuntal melody and rhythm from the Arkestra.\nListen while you have the chance … find your place amongst the stars … get in to an outer world rhythm, multiplicity of Harmony, equations of Melody … arise and seek … Astro Black and Cosmo Dark.\nThe Music of Sun Ra ‘Live in Paris’ 1971.\nKnoel Scott (Nancy, France, December 2009)",
