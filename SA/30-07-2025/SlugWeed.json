This isn’t right, it really shouldn’t be right. But it is, and you know what? You let me go through with it. So what’s the decision here? Things are always of such extreme difficulty. And it never should be. But you let make it that way. \r There’s alone, alone in the woods. What should they do? Either they can exit throughout over there, or they can come back instead.\r They’ll ask you for advice but if they don’t, then don’t paralyze. Move over, see what they need. It’s only a matter of time before the significance of an ending. You can make it right. Just go up and talk to them. No difficulty, here. Keep it long running.",

You’re grin does not stand a chance against entities that haunt your reality)\r Are you gonna have more sins\r It’s all I wanted to say for that\r Are you the way to the right change\r I’m wanted for all the mess\r (What is the meaning of this otherwise unpredictable world?)\r (It means one thing for sure. You need to get the fuck out of here before you lose touch with the reality from which you came from.)\r (The reality from which you came from, cognitive signals, mental acidity, that’s all gone before you know it.)\r (There’s no turning back is there?)\r (I don’t know.
