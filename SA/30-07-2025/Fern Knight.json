            "about": "With its fourth album Castings, Fern Knight has woven an uncommon sound from far-flung musical roots that's neither freakish folk nor stoner drone. Under classically trained cellist/guitarist/vocalist Margaret Ayre’s unwavering direction, this Philadelphian quartet continues to color her tightly arranged, smartly produced songs with such delightfully arcane influences as Eduardo Bort's symphonic art-rock, Sourdeline's progressive folk and old-school metal riffery (horns up!) gracefully. This distinctively elegant sound, coupled with the imagination and integrity of Ayre’s songwriting renders Fern Knight peerless in this age.\nThe lyrical imagery on Castings explores the well-worn memes and archetypes of the Tarot, looking both to the past and the future and notes the disparity between the high promises technology makes consumers and the actual vapidity of modern life. “Cups and Wands” pits two of the suits of the Tarot deck against each other as passivity [cups] vs. action [Wands]. The desire of forward motion when feeling stuck in a situation reverberates in the choruses: “It’s suffocating, so supplicating;” this reflects the polarity expressed in these suits and of the modern predicament. “From Zero to Infinity” chronicles the transformation of the Fool archetype into the Magician, and how this template -- when played out in our modern-day society -- has a dichotomous effect: both good and ill.\nMusically the songs on Castings reflect the lyrics’ themes and also the environment in which they were recorded -- a gothic mansion in the Brandywine Valley of Pennsylvania. Fuzz bass and full drum kit form solid foundations for Ayre’s creative arrangements; dark, lush bowed strings bump up against imposing harp flourishes; her voice is the crowning jewel in every case.",

These recordings bristle with the nascent joys of the songwriting craft--with many parts going down as the digital tape was rolling. There is also much more overt psychedelia and full-on improv--including a long instrumental jam which did not make it to the vhf release. The first 4 tracks are available as single downloads, but the full LP purchase includes 6 bonus tracks.",

            "about": "Third vhf release of lovely psych/folk by this East coast quartet, written, arranged, and performed with the now expected quality and verve. Somewhat less fastidious than 2008's exquisitely arranged Fern Knight cd (vhf110), Castings has a warm, analog feel, with looser and louder performances from the quartet. Led as always by Margaret Ayre's voice, guitar, and cello, the group stretches out on rockier fare like \"The Poisoner,\" growling with fuzz, while leaving plenty of room for softer moments of beautiful clarity. There's \"jammy\" moments here, but everything is expertly sized and placed, with not a moment wasted on doodles. The centerpiece of the album is the band's treatment of the King Crimson epic \"doom\" classic \"Epitaph.\" Trading their own cello and violin for the original's signature mellotron, the group channels the vibe of the original while making it their own. Margaret's cool and understated vocal plays it straight in a situation that less assured players and performers would make a bombastic mess of. As on the self-titled CD, Jesse Sparhawk's harp and James Wolf's violin provide the heart of the sound in many spots, a unique strategy that lets the band update the classic genre forms and styles while making them their own.",

            "about": "First widely-available album by this East Coast Quartet, channeling pysch, classic folk-prog, and chamber-style arrangements into an exquisite package. Beautifully recorded by Greg Weeks, the songs are cast in rich, detailed arrangements with Alec K. Redfearn (The Eyesores), Greg Weeks and Meg Baird (the Espers), and several other Philadelphia-area luminaries contributing to the sweeping sound. At the heart is Margie's strong voice, cello, and guitar, leading the tunes with feeling and subtlety. While in the tradition of electric-trad legends such as Fairport Convention and Trees, Fern Knight's music rings of the intensely personal and is delivered with crystal clarity, not the hipster-fuzz obfuscation of some contempo \"folk.\" M4W&A is Fern Knight's first domestic release, following their barely available debut on the German Normal label.",

            "about": "Third CD of beautiful music from Fern Knight, led by the crystal voice, guitar, and strings of Margie Wienk. Drawing from diverse influences such as Krautrock, UK folk and early baroque and renaissance music, Fern Knight's eponymous recording juxtaposes the calm surface of harp, cello, and violin against the perfectly-timed distorted squalls of Jim Ayre's Flying V and a dark undercurrent of lyrical and vocal mystery. The overall effect is a lush, pastoral and warm ode to all things green and living, a running theme that winds through the songs: \"All is lost / and all will run / over graying ground / to the rays of the sun,\" sings Wienk in the album's closing track, \"Magpie Suite Part III.\" The album's cohesion rests upon the core quartet's combination of acoustic and electronic instruments, providing the perfect vehicle for Wienk's unique song writing and string arrangements. Since the 2006 release of \"Music for Witches and Alchemists\" (vhf#101), Fern has toured extensively in the US and Europe, as well touring and recording along side contemporaries Greg Weeks and Brooke Sietinsons of Espers and Tara Burke of Fursaxa in Drag City artists The Valarie Project.",
