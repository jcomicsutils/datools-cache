Melodic lines (often expressed through layered ebows) enter as quickly as they depart, leaving no central theme except the interlocking Reichian pattern. This may be the end feels almost like two pieces of music with a bridge of synthesized waves between the two patterns, the latter being a more subtle come down to the vortex of chaotic bliss in the first section.\nLong Hallway, Three Slightly Open Doors is a step in a different direction, without a central rhythmic or melodic theme, the piece is a beautifully meandering stumble of notes falling from the guitar. A perfect counterpart to the first piece's tenseness, Long Hallway is loose, patient and indirect about it's objectives, causing the listener to react more than anticipate.\nRecorded in his home studio, Nada Sound Studio, from 2003 to 2006, both pieces are a far cry from Carbonara's solo guitar work, showing his depth as an arranger/composer in the studio beyond that of a solo improvisor.",

            "about": "Sixty Strings is an album of two epic duets by Eric Carbonara (22-string upright Chaturangui guitar) and Jesse Sparhawk (38 string lever harp). While Eric has studied Chaturangui extensively with Pandit Debashish Bhattacharya in Kolkata, and Jesse was classically trained by major figures of the harp world in his formative years, the music here is their own - not a mashup of quasi-orientalism and conservatory bloodlessness. Both side-long tracks lay out a spacious framework, with the two players working to support simple but elegant melodies that recall \"Brüder des Schattens\"-era Popol Vuh and various modal/devotional styles. While the sound of the Chaturangui's sympathetic strings provides a constant electric blanket of comfort, Eric's playing is concise and restrained, forgoing the kind of melismatic ornamentation that is a stylistic tic of much Indian-inspired music. Jesse, whose expert playing adds so much to Fern Knight's complex orchestrations, steps out and extends his instrument using various techniques - fingerpicking guitar-like patterns that interlock with Eric, and using sharply-struck attacks at the upper register for a piano-like effect. On \"The Entwined Twin,\" the dry crack of a snare drum (played by Julius Masri) enters after a few minutes, ratcheting up the urgency and adding an unexpected texture to the proceedings. The excellent recording captures both instruments in detail, with a strong aura of closeup, intimate feel.",

            "about": "Lovely second set of tracks from the entirely unusual duo of Jesse Sparhawk (38 string lever harp) and Eric Carbonara (22 string upright Chaturangui guitar, banjo, nylon string guitar). The four tracks here are restrained and unhurried, letting the elegant string flow breathe and build over each cut. Like on their debut Sixty Strings (vhf#129), there's tons of virtuoso playing, but it's not showy and crass. The guys are more mood builders (deep, cosmic, meditative) than doodlers. What's best about this is that even tho' it's immediately graspable by those of us who like \"our kind\" of music, it really doesn't sound like anyone else - a rare achievement. Along with the main dialog between the two players, the arrangements are filled out with percussion by Peterson Goodwyn, giving some of the tracks an overt groove that cuts against the spiraling string notes. Beautiful.",
