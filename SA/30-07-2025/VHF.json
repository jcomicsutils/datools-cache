            "about": "Highly-anticipated second album from the trio of Vincent De Roguin (Shora), Stephen O'Malley (Sunn0))), KTL) and Daniel O'Sullivan (Guapo). Like their genre and audience-confounding debut \"Deep In Ocean Sunk the Lamp of Light,\" \"Betimes\" is an atmospheric, constantly changing piece that encompasses a mind-boggling array of different performance and processing techniques. The deeply psychedelic and affecting results present a soundstage that is continually evolving, with new elements entering and leaving the fray every couple of seconds. Betimes includes significant contributions from free percussionists Nicolas Field and Alex Babel, who sprinkle the sound field with an almost FMP-style rush of splattering drum sound, raising the intensity of the music (without resorting to bashing). Betimes also features effects and vocals from Ulver mastermind Kristoffer Rygg.",

            "about": "Debut by trio of Stephen O'Malley (Sunn0))))), Daniel O'Sullivan (Guapo), and Vincent de Roguin (Shora). Taking its title from The Iliad, the music here is deep and cosmic, completely unlike anything you'd expect from such heavyweights. More in the tradition of 'Spiral Insana\" and \"Cyborg\" than anything, the tracks float along in a masterful collage of activity, where careful scene changes highlight O'Sullivan's classic but artfully placed Rhodes bombs, de Roguin's organ, and O'Malley's guitar. Extraordinary effort has gone into editing, mastering, and shaping these pieces - these are not tossed off improvisations or \"side-project\" orphans.",

            "about": "Stephen O'Malley (Sunn0))), KTL), Daniel O'Sullivan (Ulver, Mothlite, Guapo), Kristoffer Rygg (Ulver), Steve Noble (N.E.W., Company, etc). En Form For Blå documents the continued evolution of this unlikely collective, a collision of players from various avant, improv, metal, and \"other\" threads who together make a unique and arresting sound. Documenting three gigs in Oslo recorded in 2010, the music is deep and weird, with liquid sounds juddering around the occasionally identifiable percussion or Rhodes motif. Moving from an occasional/studio group to a frequently working live act, Æthenor has somehow kept their sound intact, taking the musique concrète-style transitions and \"what's that sound\" ethos of their three previous efforts directly to the stage. Noble, having spent a couple of decades playing drums with Derek Bailey and other well-known UK improvisers, moves the music along subtly, keeping much of the focus on the burbling sound mass. O'Malley's guitar, an instrument of extreme viscera in Sunn0))), is used with restraint, providing occasional low menace but mostly mixing it up with O'Sullivan's thematic lines and Rygg's sound treatments. The overall effect is atmospheric rather than sedate - something like a modern, small group version of Miles Davis' classic \"He Loved Him Madly\" or Nurse with Wound's \"Spiral Insana.\" Other than Supersilent, it's hard to think of anyone really working this sonic vocabulary - this is a bold engagement from players who are well-known for completely different reasons from the strangeness heard here.",

            "about": "Third earth shattering outing for Vincent De Roguin (Shora), Stephen O'Malley (Sunn0))), KTL) and Daniel O'Sullivan (Guapo). For Faking Gold and Murder, the core trio is joined by percussionists Nicolas Field and Alex Babel, as well as renown guitarist Alexander Tucker and the inimitable David Tibet. Faking Gold is Æ's heaviest outing, driven by a weighty low end and the full fury of Babel and Field's free-wheeling drums. The trio's electronics, guitar, Rhodes, and organ ride the waves of sound in a tightly-controlled blare, leaving plenty of space for Tibet's declarations of the mystical and supernatural. Tibet is on top form here, rising out of the tempest at just the right moment, almost plain-spoken in places - grounding the squall at times, voicing the apocalypse at others.\n\"Brooding, primeval, dark alchemical epics are full of a ferocious intensity, sounding more like a starlit night being ripped open by lightning than a musical group. Intelligent and primal, like a dæmonic workshop, battering up Pandemoniums and dreaming of gold and murder, Æthenor are spectacular.\"- David Tibet",

Compiled by vhf and Neil from ASC's now unavailable catalog, vhf100 is a dense mega-mix of continually peaking sound-flow. Working a tricky hybrid ground between contempo uk teams like Sunroof! and VCO, and the influence of Kompakt-style pulsating electronic \"techno,\" ASC's music shimmers and throbs in a truly psychedelic manner. Neil and Tirath Singh Nirmala have radically re-worked these tracks to be unrecognizable from their original CDR issues, but they are instantly recognizable as part of the unrelenting ASC rainbow stream.\nNeil Campbell, in his own words:\nI don't avoid the obvious - I stare straight into its eyes and ride it wherever it's taking me. But I never consciously try to imitate any form of music - that just wouldnt work. Ive enjoyed some zen approaches, but Im more basic northern European pantheist pagan in my worldview. Make a pile of new records and keep on playing. They seem to be popular with some people. New primitive twenty-first century elevation sunburst music for heavy nervous systems. I like to feel wild and out of control and like Im ripping a small hole in reality when I play, so theyre the zones I aim for. Thats climax for me. I guess I naturally gravitate towards harmony rather than melody too. My kids, and I think most kids, just seem to respond to music from birth onwards. But it's the primal thing that music has that, for me, gives it the edge over other art forms - instant celestial transport, probably works as much on our physiologies as it does our aesthetics. But Im as profane as I am sacred, so I can get the same feeling from certain dance music or noise or elevated rock music or whatever. There are many routes to the top of the mountain, as the saying goes. I use any instruments I can get my hands on that sound right. I just open up and listen, and let the music take me wherever it wants to. I listen to a wide variety of music, so maybe that rubs off? But I dont stop, wait for applause then do another number. I just let it all roll together. Because of this I was never too sure about the thing as a CDR when he asked me if he could keep it available in that format - seemed like it was then elevated into something \"finished\" or whatever, which it was never intended as. But he still loves his nursery rhyme tapes too. That kind of neurotic approach was blighting my solo recordings for a while, so very little came out for a while because I was always wanting to do one last overdub, one last edit, one more mix, etc etc. I'd like to approach it more like a DJ set than a greatest hits type of thing, layering and smashing different pieces together to create something a bit new. But, anyway, I like to keep some of my releases a bit underground and difficult to get hold of Ive no problem with the elitism of that. Having kids has been a kick up the arse really, and I've become more productive and happier with what I produce as a result. Im old school - vinyl is still king in our house. Last time it was a total ridiculous joyous gush of idiot excitement that just seemed to go higher and higher - it was like The Ramones, only even better. I havent found musical differences a problem why should they be? I think theyre a strength. I just let it all hang out and see what happens. It seemed to take the 60s pop music I grew up listening to and gave it an extra twist. Speaking abstractly, then sure Id like to improve, but Ive no idea what this would entail, as my own musical progress suggests the best way to improve is to stop trying to do or be anything that doesnt feel right. I get my love of sustained tones and pentatonic melodies from bagpipes. Its more about feeling than intellect. I just do what I feel like doing, and like to keep the astral social jams really mixed up and incongruous. There's no intellectual \"point\" to my music - it's just stuff to take me, and hopefully anyone who experiences it, higher. I guess, to me, all good music gives you what Indian music describes as rapid transit elevated, joyous, intoxicating. Its that simple - thats what I listen for in music. That said, its generally ideas I have that may not have worked in the band, so it sometimes tends towards being more electronic and process-based. But I've been doing it long enough that I can just surrender myself to the music and let it do the talking. I'm often incapable of conversation after I've played. Its the raw joyous rocket lift-off starting from a simple tune. The limited editions were there because Id been a little too precious about my solo recordings, so was using the early CDRs as psychic enemas and testing grounds for ideas - I wanted to release them then forget about them, to encourage me to work more quickly and experiment with more ideas. Probably too many to remember. Totally claustrophobic and intense. He shook every man's hand before they left, and kissed all the ladies. And anyway, I think the best music is usually that which is cut quickly and without too much premeditation, so my circumstances just keep me sharp and on my toes. Ah, so much happiness. I love playing music, it really gives me a lift, and I like to convey some sort of feeling of joy through it, so I couldn't really pinpoint any one piece. But I often fall into natural structures when I play, and I dont shy away from them theyre like breathing, or birth, or the seasons. That pleases me - it's a huge clichÃ??but I do feel like some sort of conduit/lightning rod for sounds and feelings that are already out there and just waiting to be unleashed. Basic pagan worldview, with little need for late-christian/materialist \"genius\" crap, y'know? No idea - whatever makes life easy for you. Keep it simple. I think its great when someone can devote themselves utterly to one instrument and really perfect their style, but its not a route to the summit that Im particularly interested in. As Ive got looser and less organised over the years, Ive got better at taking musical hints as to how pieces should develop. I don't take psychedelic drugs, if that's what you mean. Beautiful monotony. I spent a lot of time sitting around talking about producing things. To me, it sounds like theyre picking up from certain places weve hit on and really moving the sound forward into higher realm alien territory. As much as anything you do can be a celebration - cooking a meal, having sex, walking the dog. There are times when the mood is so festive when I play, then others when it's more of a glorious purging of all misery and frustration. I dont understand your distinction between a musical instrument and a sound generator theres no real hierarchy there, is there? It's always been like that with me I spent much of my late teens/early 20s on the dole, hanging out, partying, being \"bohemian\", and producing very little of note. Whatever, I didn't argue, so he fired ahead. Strange thing is that it does prefigure my approach in Astral Social Club, where I've stopped trying to present things as \"finished\" and stopped worrying if the whole thing doesn't run together as a completely smooth whole. Seems like that stuff often really only comes alive on vinyl, flipping it over every 15-20 minutes, gazing at beautiful big 12\" sleeves while listening. Largely, take it as it comes. Drones just resonate really well with the human body, they're really obvious pleasure-givers, spirit-lifters, ass-shakers, head-spinners. Nothing particularly esoteric. Ah, it's no big deal - there are plenty of us out there juggling all manner of other commitments with the absolute necessity of making music or whatever. Its just how my music sounds best to me. Right now our six week old son stops very still when music comes on - some of it holds his attention, some of it doesn't, but it's too early to discern any preferences. He had a great time with Basement Jaxx the other evening though. Nah, totally quotidian - whatever time to myself I can snatch. I was more interested in pure sound, but I never heard any kindred spirits for a while - I was just listening to punk bands. I use whatever amuses me and works within the sound. But the converse applies, and sometimes I may feel like I'm just coasting, or trying to find the right sound to hit the spot, but then I'll listen back to the tape and it'll sound wonderful and just right. Once I stopped worrying, and invented Astral Social Club as a \"band\" to be the receptacle for my solo recordings, I became much happier with them and the whole recording process. I'm so fired up for astral social action right now! Or maybe let someone else do the talking: \"the year is 1632, and you are astonished to find that your lute'n'flute band has been commissioned by the king to play at his grand hog roast in two days' time. unfortunately your mate with the sitar has been staying at your cottage for the past few weeks and you've neglected to practice much. also unfortunately, you are all completely mashed on opium. No real reason for that, other than it felt right, and I may go in completely the opposite direction at any point. But I like to get myself and the listeners out of our minds/bodies, to suspend the inevitable flow of time, overload the senses a bit, so I guess that's pretty psychedelic. I just open up and let it happen. My three-year old son genuinely likes abstract noise and has been known to throw a tantrum if I try to play anything too \"normal\". The mighty benevolence and indifference of the city of Leeds. As for me, I have a very limited social life, don't play computer games, don't watch films, try not to waste too much time. I prioritise. I love the multiphonic sky-soaring textures. I like to foreground things like random overdubs, ridiculous processing, loops, electronic noise. Astral Social Club just lets me have full reign to indulge whatever folly I feel like indulging. Id say all of those things occur in my music. I never held with that boring \"artistic\" notion of the pram in the hall being the enemy of creativity anyway. Once I heard things that were a little further out, I knew there were other people out there who were making up their own rules, and that gave what I had been doing some kind of validity, made me feel as though there may be people out there who would be interested in what I was doing. I might drink a beer or a glass of wine or a whisky first, then retire to the attic room and press the record button. I love records, but I'm no obsessive collector - I'm too tight to pay big prices, and I like to keep a healthy turnover of sound in my life, so am constantly getting rid of things. Theres no real concerted effort to sound that way, or reference any ritual music, but sometimes Ill hear some religious or trance music from some far flung corner of the world and be knocked out at how its hitting similar highs to the ones I aim for. Yeah, it's got harder to find the time over the past few years, with starting a family and all that, but that just encourages me to use my time better. If you can't do something worthwhile jamming live to minidisk or a tape recorder, then maybe you shouldn't be doing music (and I'm speaking as someone who often likes to layer and process things heavily using a computer). Really? That's amusing to me, in that the thing was originally conceived as a cassette, cut out of all the left-over bits from some of my more dense workouts - backing tracks and early drafts if you like. I cant play any instrument properly. Everything is possible, nothing is permitted, yknow? No-one ever mentions that, which I guess says as much about my listeners and peers as it does about me. I dont always hit that spot, or hit it only fleetingly, but its worth it for the times when I do. I like simple melodies, rhythms and harmonics, but like to hear a slew of simple things stacked up and bouncing off each other. I knock the most things over when I play, break the most things. The others were great musicians I was either holding them back, or keeping them in check. The only thing I can't find a current use for is the songwriting seems dead to me now. It's only comparatively recently that anyone outside my immediate circle of friends has paid any attention to the music I make it's nice to get some sort of recognition, but I'd still be plugging away at it if no-one else was interested. I've no idea. But now you put it like that, any good music can be as good a vision of the eternal as we're gonna get. I just let the grooves happen, and if they dont sound much like other western forms I just accept it, no problem. That said, I work within certain tunings, have certain modes of playing and have been playing long enough to make some of my jams seem as if they may have been in some way composed. I like it best when there's the astral social tonal centre supporting me when I go right out on a limb, and I don't know what sound I'm playing, what my equipment is doing, what anyone else is doing, what my name is, nothing. That seems more like prog rock or something, really concerned with structure and progression, whereas Im just dropping my pants, howling at the moon, and letting the music take me where it needs to go. But Im constantly influenced by all sorts of things, and they maybe spring up in my sound (or maybe not!). Ive gradually become less organised, less centred, and Im really happy with this. I like file-share for my music, especially with things that go out of print, so its OK by me when people upload and download things. Not particularly. In fact, Im so indebted to the Moe Tucker stress-every-beat approach you wouldnt believe it. So the bits of the sound that are predetermined (the tunings and sustained tones) make it easier to get right out and free and, uh, \"sound my barbaric yawp over the rooftops of the world\". If I start with the basic premise that I'm never going to have enough time, then anything I get done is a bonus. I guess, to me, all those musics give you what Indian music describes as rapid transit theyre elevated, joyous, intoxicating. Its that simple - thats what I listen for in music. It's been a friend, a comfort, a drug, a challenger, an inexhaustible source of inspiration to me over the years, so I assume it may perform similar functions for others. Like ODB though, ooh baby I like it raw. I get a real adrenaline rush off of the thing. They're my friends and soul-brothers/sisters. I've no interest in \"concepts\", only \"results\" if it doesn't hit me on a visceral level, then I've no use for it. It began in horrible noise and drones in the late 70s/early 80s, became tempered with some loose songwriting toward the end of the 80s, then out into wide open rocking improvisation, looping electronics and more horrible noise at the start of the 90s, and then to where I am now. I liked how they sounded, so thought a cassette would be a cheap and unpretentious way of rounding them all up for anyone who was interested. In many ways, some of my modes of playing start at the energy level some bands end on, so Im at some sort of climax point from the start. I just play everything is improvised. In essence, I've found a sound and an approach, and Im often attempting to play the same piece over and over again, and it's the failures and inconsistencies that are keeping me interested and hopefully interesting. I liked to take a few more chances and dive headlong into areas that the band couldn't or wouldn't go, often ones where I felt an antipathy towards the results of most other practitioners in that that field. But then so much generic \"psychedelic\" music doesn't do any of that it's just polite pop music with a few period stylings whereas, for example, japanese noise or renaissance choral music or indian classical music or techno all hit that spot much more reliably. Sometimes I can remember every moment, and at others hardly anything. Music that swallows misery whole, as Iggy once described the early Stooges gigs. Purely practical we played live music, so recorded live, straight to 2-track (so no remixing or anything at a later date). The mood was just right. No idea. I just felt it was something I had to do. We never had musical instruments around the house when I was a kid, but I started recording with tape decks and kitchen implements when I was 13, in 1979. They're great spirit-lifters like that. Ive always used a range of different sorts of instruments, from acoustic to electronic, but Ive slowly moved towards a balance that is more amplified and electronic than it once was. I just plug in, tune up and play. But as soon as I bit the bullet and got a regular job that messed my life up and shagged me out, I became much more focussed and productive. Although I say I improvise, I often use certain notes and forms, so its not free improvisation. Sometimes I think Ive played terribly and people in the audience tell me its the best time they ever saw me, and vice versa. Its all subjective. I dont mind elitism, but I also have a fair few widely available releases out there. Beautiful. Fried human loop loop wah sound. Bollocks to that - I have a mundane day job four days a week, look after the kids for the rest of the time, and do music whenever else I can, and I feel like I'm at the top of my game. Y'know, look around it's not much of an overstatement to say that most music is based around sustained tones in some form, whether overt or otherwise. It may sound pretentious, but my most important instrument is the air that carries the sound. Having kids has been a kick up the arse really, and I've become more productive and happier with what I produce as a result. But, yeah, the feeling I get from playing music doesn't always transfer to the recording. I was the untrained idiot in the band, just trying to push it higher and higher. Bad music that uses drones is as dull as dull can be, but good music that uses similar building blocks really takes off for me. Nothing tangible, but it's good mental health to be attuned to your dreams, and like to be healthy. Sometimes I feel a musical affinity with absolutely no-one, but at other loads of stuff all over the place. Friends, family, friendly faces and good vibes when I play live, good food and drink, my music, other people's music, anything done with soul. I was inspired by the \"anyone can do it\" punk ethos, although I never played \"punk rock\". Not an exercise, that's too sterile. I love being in the same room as them, whether they're playing or not.",

            "about": "Boggling and super-fun 100+ minutes from Neil Campbell's Astral Social Club, bringing you the head-on collision of classic UK electronic styles, electric grit, and THE FUTURE. The LP starts with a side of tight chuggers, the high-end racket of “Infinity Thug” ripping through the speakers as you make your way to the end of the side with the loping “Grisly Terroir.” Side 2 is the 20 minute epic “Diamonds in the Dreich,” a mid-tempo journey of Throbbing Gristle-ish lurch-pulse and disembodied voices, giving way after 10 mins to an organ-interlude which accelerates into a full-on rock jam loaded with scathing guitar slashing. Unlike anything else in the ASC catalog. The CD (“Side 3”) is 3 lengthy explorations of key facets of the overall Astral Social concept, where Neil really stretches out and lets the tape run – the rushing sound effects and buried rock of “Sun Still God”; the bristling electric juddering of “Erotic Meditation”; and the blown-out space-rock (!) of “Squeegee Anthem #3.”",
            "credits": "released June 8, 2017\nRecorded 2012-2014. \"Sun Still God\" and \"Squeegee Anthem\" appeared in earlier versions on releases by Tor Press and Sheepscar Light Industrial.

            "about": "Neil Campbell's unique Astral Social Club return to VHF after a couple of years in the underground wilderness with the squelching, restless ambience of Octuplex. The CD is split roughly in half between Harmonia/Voigt-style chuggers and sweeping swirls of instantly recognizable dronage, familiar from Neil's extensive contributions to Vibracathedral Orchestra, Sunroof! and others. Neil's interest in \"techno\" comes out on \"Caustic Roe\" and \"Muscle Adductor,\" neatly compiling the influence of recent minimal jam innovations with piles of synth and effects noise, lending the beat-driven tracks a rough, unfussy style. Other cuts like \"Mügik Churn\" and \"Pilgrim Sunburst\" swell with twittering electric birdsong and synthetic rain, the trademark sound of many Astral titles. Octuplex is full up with collaborator cameos, including the familiar (Richard Youngs, John Clyde-Evans), and the novel (Spider Stacy - from the Pogues!).",

            "about": "Following a series of records with Thrill Jockey (including the sensational Seasonal Hire with Steve Gunn), the Black Twigs return to the VHF mothership to continue their charming and original take on Old Time and Appalachian-inspired string band sounds. Together since 2001, and a continuous presence in the music’s true home of Southwest Virginia, the Twigs represent the actively working evolution of the traditions – learning songs from other locals, playing dances at the Floyd Country Store, etc – without retro-artifice or nostalgia. The ragged-but-right performances and recording (and Sally Ann Morgan’s perfect cover design) sit at the ideal intersection of DIY/”underground” and local string sound values. On Friend’s Peace, the band travels a range of styles, from the lovely harmony on the trad-classic “Moonshiner” to the racing fiddle/guitar/banjo on the “Money Musk” medley. Mixed in with the traditional songs are several perfectly-placed original tunes, including Mike Gangloff’s keening “Cara’s Waltz” and Isak Howell’s solo guitar spotlight on “Barnswallow.”",
            "credits": "released April 2, 2021\nSally Anne Morgan: fiddle, vocals\nMike Gangloff: Hardanger-style fiddle, octave fiddle, vocals, singing bowl, sruti box\nNathan Bowles: banjo, washboard vocals\nIsak Howell: guitar, harmonica, sruti box\nwith Andrew Zinn: guitar, tenor guitar, vocals\nand Joe Dejarnette: bass\nRecorded and mixed in Topeca, Floyd County, Virginia, by Joe Dejarnette/Studio 808a; Mastered by Harris Newman/Greymarket; Cover by Sally Anne Morgan\nLaid down before the Great Isolation and offered in hope for the community to come. MOONSHINER: Sally and husband Andrew sing words from West Virginian Currence Hammonds’ version of this widespread song, with a melodic structure from John Gallagher. If you haven’t heard Currence, or John’s album with Scott Prouty and Chris Coole (or with Dwight Diller and Tom King), you should. MONEY MUSK/ICY MOUNTAIN/TOMMY HAWK: Sally and I start the song with Money Musk, inspired by Dwight’s recording of James Hammons (a cousin of Currence and son of fiddle giant Edden), then everyone joins in for Icy Mountain, learned partly from the recordings of WV/Ohio fiddler Ward Jarvis. The medley’s third part is Tommy Jackson’s (and maybe Hark Garland’s) song Tomahawk that Jackson had on one of his 1950s square dance albums and which entered the folk repertoire in the fiddling of Ward Jarvis, among others. We’d heard recordings of Ward playing it at his home but it was Steve Kruger’s playing at Blacksburg, Va., sessions that started us. CARA’S WALTZ is one of my songs inspired by my wife and has been played many times for the dancers at the Floyd Country Store in Floyd, Va. SHEETS OF RAIN, STREAMS OF SUN is a dream of changes of cloud and light across the mountainsides, sometimes slow, sometimes less so. WILL YOU MISS WHEN I’M GONE? is one we’ve sung for years and always is better when Andrew is with us to knit together the harmony, as he does here. ROAN MOUNTAIN SALLY ANN comes from the mighty Roan Mountain Hilltoppers, whose skill and power and sheer welcoming exuberance should be inspirations for anyone playing this music. KNIGHT ON THE ROAD: First heard from Maddy Prior and Tim Heart, but Sally found a version collected by Artus Moser of Western North Carolina. BARNSWALLOW: Isak calls this an inadvertent tribute to our pal Charlie Parr, also part of a long, ongoing attempt to catch some of the sweetness, simplicity and dissonance of Elizabeth Cotten’s beautiful playing. ST. VALENTINE’S MARCH & ELLISTON JOY: Two love songs -- one grew from the other after Cara asked if the tune had words. The banjo sticks came later. DAN FRIEND’S PIECE is a West Virginia tune we picked up years ago from the magnificent recordings of Ernie Carpenter. For us, it became a lament for our friend Jack Rose when we played it at memorials a decade ago. Then it opened farther and farther, taking us into all sorts of spaces, a winding path to renewal.\n-- Mike Gangloff, Ironto, Virginia, August 2020\nTunings: Instruments were mostly in usual old-time A, D or modal tunings, dropped a half step. So fiddles were either (low to high) G#D#G#D# or G#C#G#D#, with sympathetics on the hardanger setup\nspread across those tunings. Banjo was (5th string first, then low to\nhigh) g#D#G#CD#, g#C#G#C#D#, or g#D#G#C#D#. Guitar was EADGBE, capo’d somewhere to fit the song. Harps were A-flat, D-flat\nand F#. Bass was EbAbC#F#. Andrew tunes on the spot.\nAll songs traditional, these arrangements © 2018/2020 Black Apple, except Cara’s Waltz; Sheets of Rain, Streams of Sun; St. Valentine’s\nMarch; and Elliston Joy by Mike Gangloff, © 2018/2020; Barnswallow\nby Isak Howell, © 2018/2020; Will You Miss Me When I’m Gone? by\nA.P.

            "about": "Sprawling 4th full length from the Black Twigs finds a slightly reshuffled lineup and a renewed emphasis on kicking out raw, percussive takes on both Appalachian traditional and original material. With Ralph Berrier Jr.'s retirement from the group, Mike Gangloff has added fiddle to his already considerable arsenal, and along with stalwart guitarist Isak Howell, brought in Nathan Bowles (Spiral Joy Band) on percussion and several guests who make substantial contributions to the party. The Twigs work the fine line between the Friday night old-time dance party and the wellspring of grim and evocative tragedy that runs through the tradition, delivering these laments, travelogues, and wild whoops with sawing, rocking joy. This is a sprawling collection, with visceral group takes on \"Crossing the James,\" \"Cherry River Line,\" and \"Old Joe Clark.\" Charlie Parr and Lane Prekker join the crew on \"Last Kind Word Blues,\" \"Train 45\" and \"Twin Sisters\" (first essayed by Pelt way back in 98) with Parr's amazing, ragged voice leading the charge over Bowles and Prekker's driving percussion. Along with the full group material, the Twigs throw in other welcome oddities such as Howell's Fahey-like \"At the head of Every Creek,\" \"P.E.A. Vine Blues,\" an arrangement of a tune from Portuguese Africa, and a book ending solo version of \"Crossing the James,\" with Gangloff on baritone banjo.",
            "credits": "released September 3, 2018\n“These songs all go down the same road,” Coolidge Winesett liked to say. “But each one takes a little different turn.” Coolidge was a fiddler and a storyteller who lived nearly all his life in Ivanhoe, on the border\nof Virginia's Wythe and Carroll counties. A decade ago, when he welcomed me into his home and his music for a couple years of\nvisits, he’d tell great tales of him and a cousin riding their horse home after performing at house parties in the years before World War II, the mountain roads so dark that he couldn’t see his cousin sitting directly in front of him and trusted the horse to know its way. And he described\nhow when the train brought in a weekly shipment of livestock, someone was always playing fiddle or banjo at the depot, music in the air.\nThat sort of street old-time is where we've hitched ourselves in recent years. We haven’t found a weekly livestock shipment, but we’ve busked on sidewalks and streets –and piers and parking lots – and next to a\nsno-cone stand on the Outer Banks. Taking the sound out into the world, into the air, has helped us find our own place in this music of so many spheres.\nIt’s about the music, but here’s who we are:\nBlack Twig Pickers\nIsak Howell: Guitar, harp, rattletrap, vocals\nMike Gangloff: Fiddle, banjo, resonator guitar, vocals\nNathan Bowles: Washboard, washtub, fiddlesticks, kazoogle, vocals\nWith Amy Shea, Chris Howell, Tim\nThornton, Charlie Parr & Lane Prekker\nSound as time machine: Playing on the Charlottesville mall, a washboard, guitar and banjo thumping hopefully along behind an open case, flash of realization that we could be at any point in the last century or before.\nSound as personal archaeology: Trying to trace via fiddle and banjo a branch of my family’s wanderings through Southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky; tracking the songs once common to the counties around us, giving them another breath.\nSound as compass: lodestar for the made-at-home, non-prepackaged, non-standardized, not-for-(much)-profit, everyone join in. Brothers and sisters. Playing the people's jazz.\nCoolidge: saw the music as a highway or a railroad or a river that connected almost everything -- his stories of the animals who danced in his barn or the woman who could change the weather with her clawhammer banjo playing, countless festivals, shows and porch sessions, the living and dead, and even me, a struggling banjo-er who'd just arrived from out of town.\nInstruments: I played an old fiddle that Pete Ross of Glasgow, Va., restored to life. \"It was in pieces,\" he told me, and truly, the more I look\nat it, the more of Pete's handiwork I see. It's a marvelous instrument. On Twin Sisters I played a late 19th-/early 20th century Tyrolean fiddle that Amy Nichols lent me. I played a fretless banjo, one of Lo Gordon's Cedar Mountain creations from his workshop in Brevard, N.C.; a resonator guitar put together by Bill Blue of New Smyrna Beach, Fla.; and a gutstrung, tackhead baritone banjo that Steve Salay and I built awhile back. Isak played a Martin dreadnought whose sound has never been adequately captured on tape. For the songs with Charlie, Isak borrowed Tim's smaller-bodied parlor guitar Martin, thinking it would record more clearly. Tim warned him it had a few buzzes, and it did. Isak's rattletrap is a custom model that Isak continues to modify, adding and subtracting nails from the boards, putting a layer of foam rubber between the planks for cushioning, switching the ties for the tambourine, and other tweaks that occur to him late at night. Nathan's washtub came from Farmer's Supply in Floyd, Va. His kazoogle is something Isak found somewhere. His washboard came down through Amy's family. It's a Sunnyland model made by the Columbus Washboard Co. back before they started printing\ntheir web address on the boards.\nThank you\nWilla, Tycho, Ivy, Elsa, Emily, Mikel (for help with recording, etc.), Emily, Alex Clayden, Bill, Kevin Long & Cellar staff, Woody Crenshaw and everyone at the Floyd Country Store (especially the dancers, which takes in nearly everybody), Laurie Lewis & Green Dolphinians, WPAQ, Sam Linkous, Aaron Rosenblum, Chip & Ashley & family (a new record for attending Black Twig shows), Thorntons, Sue, Tom, Eric Langston, Vinton convention folks, Hope Hollingsworth, Jeyon,\nCasey Elder, Frances West, Ralph & Ruth & Lucy, Purple Fiddlers, Phil & Kelly, Jumpin' Jim & Brenda, Jack, Patrick, Amy Nichols & family, Richard Bowman for thoughts on local repertoires, and Glenn Jones for inspiration and example re: extreme liner notes -- I haven't matched you on clarity or insight, but I'm clearly catching up on length.",

Since 2003's Soon One Morning, the Black Twig trio of Mike Gangloff, Ralph Berrier, and Isak Howell has expanded to a quartet with the addition of bassist Mike Gayheart. Midnight Has Come and Gone is made up of mostly of original material, road tested at gigs and festivals along the Blue Ridge. Topical stormers like \"Fire in the Stove\" and \"Blood Red Clay\" are live staples, belted out here in a virtuoso hail of guitar, fiddle, banjo, and rough harmony. In contrast to the more trad sounding fare, the grungy and twisting \"Bent Mountain Drag\" recalls \"Beggar's\" era-Rolling Stones. Continuing the Black Twig tradition of beautiful instrumentals, \"Twilight on the Radford Army Ammunition Plant\" is another hymn-like meditation outside the showy-offy bluegrass tradition. \"Original Natural Bridge Blues\" is a song from 1941, which has been recorded in an incomplete fashion by many groups over the years. Ralph's discovery of the original 1940's sheet music in a family photo album revealed a lost verse, presented here for the first time.",

            "about": "First CD by this now well-known group, raw edged takes on Appalachia, old time, etc. Completely authentic. The Black Twigs represents the continued persistence of a type of Appalachian folk music that has come and gone from the popular radar over the years, but has never really disappeared from the band's Southwest Virginia home. The songs on \"North Fork Flyer\" are mostly traditional numbers (with a few originals sprinkled in) that form the backbone of a century-old tradition - the music of bonfires, front porches, coal miner's festivals, and informal gatherings. Over the years, \"mountain ragas\" (as the group calls them) like \"Angelina Baker,\" \"Spike Driver's Blues,\" \"Poor Boy Long Ways From Home\" and \"Sail Away Ladies\" have been recorded, performed, and revised continually by luminaries such as Bukka White, Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, Bob Wills, Holy Modal Rounders, New Lost City Ramblers, etc, etc - a who's who of true American artistry. Recorded live to DAT on front porches and in family rooms, \"North Fork Flyer\" blends fiddle blues, sinewy guitar and the drone and twitch of fretless clawhammer banjo with the band's rough-around-the-edges but warm harmonies. Played to the accompaniment of night insects, passing trains, and the noise of wandering children, the music retains the charm of tradition but is free of fake antiquarianism and nostalgia - regardless of age, the music is just as relevant today as it was 100 years ago and the band plays it like they mean it. The band name comes from the oldest, most crotchety apple variety in the orchard that fiddler Ralph Berrier's family maintains along the musically fertile Virginia-North Carolina line.",
            "credits": "released May 22, 2017\nRalph Berrier Jr: Fiddle, Vocals\nMike Gangloff: Banjo, Vocals\nIsak Howell: Guitar, Harmonica, Vocals\nwith Dan Crawford: Spoons\nRecorded on front porches and in front rooms in Ironto and Roanoke, VA, Autumn and Winter 2000. Thanks to Amy, Chris, Ruth and Tycho, to Bill Kellum, to Tom Angleberger for Artwork, and to the many people who helped write these songs. A few notes: Spike Driver's Blues is from John Hurt, the Monroe Brothers, and all the Nine Pound Hammers; Ralph's Cousin Rafe Brady had a lot to do with Ebeneezer, but Coolidge Winsett showed us how to play it; We wrote Great Valley Mine for the Montgomery-Pulaski County Miner's Association; Reuben's Blues came from Kentucky but ended up somewhere else.",

            "about": "Second album by this SW Virginia area trio. Soon One Morning is firmly planted in Old-Time Appalachian tradition, but concentrates mostly on original material. Standing out in particular is \"Floyd Allen,\" Ralph Berrier Jr's masterful retelling of an area tragedy with a sweet and unexpected major/minor chorus change-up. Mike Gangloff's lengthy and elegiac instrumental \"This War Is Killing Me\" glides along on a sad melody passed around between resonator guitar, cello and fiddle. Many tracks are anchored by Gangloff's unusual gut-string baritone banjo. Two solo instrumentals on the CD add balance between the vocal numbers - Isak Howell's \"Have You Been To Alabama?\" is a subtle fingerpicked workout, while Gangloff's \"Ironto Special\" is a considerably more exotic-sounding modal construction on the big banjo. Elsewhere, there's an upbeat essay of \"Pallet On The Floor,\" a relation to \"Poor Boy Long Ways From Home,\" which appeared on the groups debut North Fork Flyer album. Among the traditional numbers, none is more striking than the group's charging and rough treatment of \"Oh Death,\" with Gangloff and Berrier spitting out the call and response vocal which gives the album its title.",
            "credits": "released March 14, 2017\nThe Black Twig Band is Isak Howell, guitar and harmonica; Ralph Berrier Jr., fiddle and vocals; and Mike Gangloff, baritone and Supertone banjos, resonator guitar, and vocals.

            "about": "Third vhf release of lovely psych/folk by this East coast quartet, written, arranged, and performed with the now expected quality and verve. Somewhat less fastidious than 2008's exquisitely arranged Fern Knight cd (vhf110), Castings has a warm, analog feel, with looser and louder performances from the quartet. Led as always by Margaret Ayre's voice, guitar, and cello, the group stretches out on rockier fare like \"The Poisoner,\" growling with fuzz, while leaving plenty of room for softer moments of beautiful clarity. There's \"jammy\" moments here, but everything is expertly sized and placed, with not a moment wasted on doodles. The centerpiece of the album is the band's treatment of the King Crimson epic \"doom\" classic \"Epitaph.\" Trading their own cello and violin for the original's signature mellotron, the group channels the vibe of the original while making it their own. Margaret's cool and understated vocal plays it straight in a situation that less assured players and performers would make a bombastic mess of. As on the self-titled CD, Jesse Sparhawk's harp and James Wolf's violin provide the heart of the sound in many spots, a unique strategy that lets the band update the classic genre forms and styles while making them their own.",

            "about": "First widely-available album by this East Coast Quartet, channeling pysch, classic folk-prog, and chamber-style arrangements into an exquisite package. Beautifully recorded by Greg Weeks, the songs are cast in rich, detailed arrangements with Alec K. Redfearn (The Eyesores), Greg Weeks and Meg Baird (the Espers), and several other Philadelphia-area luminaries contributing to the sweeping sound. At the heart is Margie's strong voice, cello, and guitar, leading the tunes with feeling and subtlety. While in the tradition of electric-trad legends such as Fairport Convention and Trees, Fern Knight's music rings of the intensely personal and is delivered with crystal clarity, not the hipster-fuzz obfuscation of some contempo \"folk.\" M4W&A is Fern Knight's first domestic release, following their barely available debut on the German Normal label.",

            "about": "Third CD of beautiful music from Fern Knight, led by the crystal voice, guitar, and strings of Margie Wienk. Drawing from diverse influences such as Krautrock, UK folk and early baroque and renaissance music, Fern Knight's eponymous recording juxtaposes the calm surface of harp, cello, and violin against the perfectly-timed distorted squalls of Jim Ayre's Flying V and a dark undercurrent of lyrical and vocal mystery. The overall effect is a lush, pastoral and warm ode to all things green and living, a running theme that winds through the songs: \"All is lost / and all will run / over graying ground / to the rays of the sun,\" sings Wienk in the album's closing track, \"Magpie Suite Part III.\" The album's cohesion rests upon the core quartet's combination of acoustic and electronic instruments, providing the perfect vehicle for Wienk's unique song writing and string arrangements. Since the 2006 release of \"Music for Witches and Alchemists\" (vhf#101), Fern has toured extensively in the US and Europe, as well touring and recording along side contemporaries Greg Weeks and Brooke Sietinsons of Espers and Tara Burke of Fursaxa in Drag City artists The Valarie Project.",

            "about": "Originally released on VHF as a CD at the end of 1994, this was the second FSA album, compiling 5 tracks from impossible to get 7\" with 20 mins of previously unreleased (and good) material. Similar in blend to the band’s first LP (also newly issued in the USA on deluxe vinyl), the songs hang together as a collection that improves on the individual singles. The two proper singles that make up half of Distance - “Soaring High”/”Standing Stone” and “Crystal Shade”/”Distance” were instant collectables upon their release, so Distance was compiled to make the songs permanent available. “Soaring High” and “Crystal Shade” are jagged bits of fuzzed-out pop genius; tracks like the mutant concrete “techno” of “Distance” and the two lengthy glissando workouts on “Oceans” and “Oceans II” offset the more conventional tunes, upping the overall impact when enjoyed as an LP.",

            "about": "Aka Rural Psychedelia, Flying Saucer Attack’s first album was released in 1993 after a couple of instantly sold-out singles. Released at the height of the shoegaze boom, the album is a blend of memorable fuzzed out songs and far-out instrumental doodles, sidestepping the rock bombast of many contemporaries in favor of a home-made aesthetic. FSA’s blend of razor-edged static, softly sung melody, and echoing atmospherics builds an atmosphere of dour beauty that sustains itself over the course of the entire program. \"My Dreaming Hill,\" \"Wish,\" and \"The Season Is Ours\" are couched in fuzz and whispery reverb, but are beautiful and accessible tunes, able to stand on their own in any context. \"Popol Vuh 1\" and \"Popol Vuh 2\" are straight up tributes to the now much better known German masters, steeped in the hushed atmosphere of the best Vuh records (if not exactly the sound).",

            "about": "Originally conceived as a \"farewell\" 7\", this EP instead neatly wraps up old FSA business on one side and finds the band with new life on the other. \"Goodbye\" is a noisy and weird collage that definitely would have been the strangest A-side in FSA history. \"And Goodbye\" documents New Zealander Roy Montgomery's (Pin Group, Dadamah, Dissolve, numerous solo works) only appearance with the band in the form of a lengthy and beautiful raga, sort of like a group version of a track off of Roy's Temple IV. \"The Whole Day\" is new FSA, and is a lovely duet between guitar and sampler evoking previous glories such as \"Distance\" and \"Popol Vuh I & II.\"",

            "about": "First ever reissue for this unique Flying Saucer Attack live album. Expanded with additional material and a new side 4 mix from Jim O’Rourke. Produced in collaboration with Dave Pearce/FSA and Bruce Russell (compiler of the original CD release for his Corpus Hermeticum label). New artwork by Bruce Russell.\nWhile rightly known for the folk-influenced songs and spacey instrumentals of their proper albums, the briefly active live version of FSA unexpectedly delivered a blistering wave of electric sound. Recorded at various shows in 1994, In Search of Spaces heaves with long passages of feedback guitar racket, broken up by sections of surging rock music. The 1994 live band focused almost exclusively on visceral, trebly guitar noise - which while always a key element in the FSA sound, was greeted by audiences with total mystification (and often disapproval). Following a few brief attempts to settle a lineup and play songs from their records, Dave Pearce/FSA abandoned live performance altogether, leaving behind this album (and a barely available CDR) as the sole document of his in-person delivery.\nOriginally compiled and released as a CD in 1996 by the Dead C’s Bruce Russell, this reissue adds several minutes of music back to the original program that had been edited out by FSA for being “too rock.” For side 4, Jim O’Rourke revisited the original 1994 live tapes and has made a spooky and brooding new mix of music exclusive to this release.",
            "credits": "released December 1, 2017\nMusic played and improvised by Sam Jones, Debbie Parsons, Matt Elliot, Rachel Coe, Dave Pearce.\nThis release restores the full original analogue mix proposed by Bruce Russell in 1996 but declined and subsequently digitally re-edited for the Corpus Hermeticum release. This has been restored and mastered from cassette for this vinyl release by Patrick Klem (Sides 1-3). Jim O'Rourke has re-compiled selections from the original 1994 source recordings into an added side-long piece (Side 4).\nOriginal source recordings by Simon, Rocker, Darryl, and the No-Fi Organisation.\nAnalogue tape collage of Sides 1-3 engineered by Tim Baird at rdu, Christchurch NZ. 1996, following a painstaking plan by Bruce Russell. Released on CD by Corpus Hermeticum, Hermes 018.\nCopyright all. Grateful thanks to everyone involved in this release.\nAll photography by Bruce Russell (1986), taken with a Kodak Instamatic in Arran, London, Harris and Lewis.\nDespite its height, the location of the London Post Office Tower was an official secret for many years. At one point Parliamentary privilege was invoked by a Member of Parliament in order that its whereabouts could be discussed in a debate in the Commons without risking prosecution. Regardless, it was the tallest structure in Central London.\nIn contrast the Stones of Machrie Moor are marked on all maps of Arran, where they have stood for two millennia, even though their use and meaning is utterly lost.\nScissors cut the thread of life. 'Futures and pasts': Neolithic-1745-1965-1986-1996-2016.\nHarmonic 33 ...and the past, are not so far away.",

            "about": "Personal selection of live material compiled by Dave Pearce for \"casual\" release. The centerpiece is \"P.A. Blues,\" a massive collage of bracing, full-on sound recorded at various 1994 shows. Moving through various moods and grooves, the piece is similar to the material on the out of print In Search Of Spaces/Live CD released a few years back on Hermes Corp, tho' there's no overlap in the content between the two CD's. Also included: the 1995 group's take on the oft-covered \"She Moved Through The Fair, a subdued performance of \"The Season Is Ours,\" and an uncirculated (and assaultive) 1994 instrumental rehearsal, which I believe pre-dates FSA's first live performance.",

            "about": "Raw and rocking collaboration between Jack Rose and the Black Twigs with some of the most swinging, hard-hitting string music waxed in many a decade. Rose's solo playing has always had a tough edge, with his prodigious technique often employed in the service of dropping right-hand bombs - his use of a thumbpick originates from his years of duets with Twig Mike Gangloff, struggling to make his guitar heard over Gangloff's crashing banjo. The front line of Rose and Gangloff's strings are joined by Isak Howell's no-nonsense guitar and harmonica and Nate Bowles' variety of expert percussion. The four players lock together with a sure-footedness honed by frequent touring and a singularity of intent to rock. Gangloff takes the vocals, howling out standards like \"Little Sadie\" firmly in the old-time tradition - without reserve. A few of the tracks here are updates of Rose & family classics, with the group turning the stately \"Kensington Blues\" upbeat and issuing an assured take on \"Bright Sunny South,\" first recorded by Pelt (w/Rose and Gangloff) back in 2001 on their gonzo classic double \"Ayahuasca.\"",

            "about": "Fourth full-length from Jack, an inspired mix of styles and sounds that brings his in-person mastery down to LP/CD scale. Kensington Blues is Jack's most diverse outing by far, with straight ragtime, heavy 12-string, and that sweet sweet Weissenborn lap guitar all checking in. Honed during endless touring in 2004, the repertoire here is delivered with maximum authority in a series of first-take performances recorded in early 2005. \"Cathedral et Chartres\" and \"Calais to Dover\" are dense, brooding 12 string numbers, recalling the key tracks on 2004's Raag Manifestos CD. \"Calais\" features a sequence of right hand picking furious enough to evoke a dream state ala Charlemagne Palestine's \"Stumming Music.\" \"Rappahanock River Rag\" and \"Flirtin' With the Undertaker\" are pure syncopated ragtime, while \"Kensington Blues\" offers an almost regal take on the intersection of Anglo and American trad. The epic \"Now That I'm A Man Full Grown\" was the signature piece of many of 2004's live shows, a display of mind-boggling slide invention that straddles the line of east and west ala \"Yaman Blues\" from the Opium Musick LP. In something of a surprise inclusion, Jack's take on Fahey's \"Sunflower River Blues\" (long a staple of Pelt and J.R. gigs but never included on a record) is subtle and expressive, with a wonderful rise and fall that perfectly accentuates Fahey's beautiful melody.",

            "about": "Recorded and originally released in 2003, Opium Musick is an eclectic collection with pieces for 12 string (the percussive and dark \"Black Pearls”), 6 string, and lap guitar. The lovely raga-ish \"Yaman Blues\" features Mike Gangloff (Pelt, Black Twig Pickers) on tanpura, and echoes the extended modal work on the contemporaneous Pelt Pearls from the River CD. The near-ragtime of \"Linden Ave Stomp\" features Glenn Jones on his vintage Gibson in a jumping duet with Jack’s lap steel. “Linden Ave” charted a path that Jack would determinedly pursue – short ragtime and old-time influenced pieces (originals and classics), with all phrasing worked out to a perfectionist standard. The lovely “Mountaintop Lamento” was memorably used in Catherine Pancake’s film about coal mining in Appalachia, Black Diamonds: Mountaintop Removal and the Fight for Coalfield Justice.\n“In the year and half between \"Red Horse, White Mule\" and \"Opium Musick\" Mr. Rose spent the majority of his time honing his Ragtime and Jass skills. He met Dr. Chattanooga Red soon after recording his 1st lp and he revealed the secrets of Ragtime and Jass to Jack in ancient ceremony. Red came down with the jake in Philadelphia and died shortly after their tour. On his deathbed he told Jack not to let the ragtime die and to bring it into the 21st century. And now we have \"Opium Musick\" as a result of Jack's studies and travels, a lovely tribute to Jack's beloved teacher.”\nJoe R. Sack, Blues Scholar, on Opium Musick",

            "about": "Originally compiled from a variety of sources as a limited edition CD to sell on tour in 2004 (released by VHF, later released on vinyl by Eclipse), Raag Manifestos presents much of Jack’s rawest and most experimental music, cutting across various acoustic styles, but with a much more jagged and aggressive attack than later music. “Black Pearls from the River” and “Hart Crane’s Old Boyfriends” are dense, serious assaults on the 12 string, with the intensity of the latter enhanced by Ian Nagoski’s roaring electronic backdrop. With subtle tabla accompaniment by Eric Carbonara, “Crossing The Great Waters” is another epic modal journey in the style of Pelt’s “Road To Catawba” and Jack’s own “Red Horse.” The traditional “Blessed Be the Name of the Lord” finishes off the LP on a calming note.",

            "about": "Jack’s 2002 solo debut Red Horse, White Mule was a bit of an outlier in the underground gestalt at the time of issue, coming just before the wave of releases from the new generation of Takoma/Fahey-inspired players. Strictly a solo affair, Red Horse balances the epic side long raga of “Red Horse” against a second side of shorter pieces, including the ragged slide style of “The Colonel’s Blues.” Jack’s technique doesn’t have the refinement that it would quickly find, but the compositions and performances hit thread the needed between the new and the classic with a rough hewn charm.\n“Rose's personalized and disparate criteria awaken feelings of both rapture and tragedy on the scale of that which must have been felt by the newly-wed anthropologist who drove Kiowa Indian guests out of his Oklahoma residence with Victrola discs of Amelita Galli-Curci in order to go to bed with his bride or the child who, on hearing Bugs Bunny sing Queen Liluokalani's dirge \"Aloha Oe,\" quarantined himself in the clothes hamper until such time that the United States withdraws from Hawai'i.”\nKisan Nagai, Blues Scholar, on Red Horse, White Mule",

            "about": "Sixty Strings is an album of two epic duets by Eric Carbonara (22-string upright Chaturangui guitar) and Jesse Sparhawk (38 string lever harp). While Eric has studied Chaturangui extensively with Pandit Debashish Bhattacharya in Kolkata, and Jesse was classically trained by major figures of the harp world in his formative years, the music here is their own - not a mashup of quasi-orientalism and conservatory bloodlessness. Both side-long tracks lay out a spacious framework, with the two players working to support simple but elegant melodies that recall \"Brüder des Schattens\"-era Popol Vuh and various modal/devotional styles. While the sound of the Chaturangui's sympathetic strings provides a constant electric blanket of comfort, Eric's playing is concise and restrained, forgoing the kind of melismatic ornamentation that is a stylistic tic of much Indian-inspired music. Jesse, whose expert playing adds so much to Fern Knight's complex orchestrations, steps out and extends his instrument using various techniques - fingerpicking guitar-like patterns that interlock with Eric, and using sharply-struck attacks at the upper register for a piano-like effect. On \"The Entwined Twin,\" the dry crack of a snare drum (played by Julius Masri) enters after a few minutes, ratcheting up the urgency and adding an unexpected texture to the proceedings. The excellent recording captures both instruments in detail, with a strong aura of closeup, intimate feel.",

            "about": "Lovely second set of tracks from the entirely unusual duo of Jesse Sparhawk (38 string lever harp) and Eric Carbonara (22 string upright Chaturangui guitar, banjo, nylon string guitar). The four tracks here are restrained and unhurried, letting the elegant string flow breathe and build over each cut. Like on their debut Sixty Strings (vhf#129), there's tons of virtuoso playing, but it's not showy and crass. The guys are more mood builders (deep, cosmic, meditative) than doodlers. What's best about this is that even tho' it's immediately graspable by those of us who like \"our kind\" of music, it really doesn't sound like anyone else - a rare achievement. Along with the main dialog between the two players, the arrangements are filled out with percussion by Peterson Goodwyn, giving some of the tracks an overt groove that cuts against the spiraling string notes. Beautiful.",

            "about": "Astro Love is the first widely available solo release in several years from Kawabata, emerging from a period of relative quiet with this blockbuster Krautrock-flavored epic. On the whole, this a lovely and impressionistic record, the other side of Makoto’s outrageous works with Acid Mothers’ Temple. Taking cues from classics of the genre like Tangerine Dream’s Phaedra and Steve Hillage’s Rainbow Dome Music, “Dos Nurages” is the centerpiece of the record, a 41 minute hypnotic epic, with echoplex’d guitar anchoring a stream of expertly done glissando. “Astro Love & Infinite Kisses” is a darker drone, in the traditions of Kawabata’s INUI series of releases for VHF. “Woman From Dream Island” finishes the record with a thick buzz of tamboura overlaid with trippy backwards guitar, before giving way to a gentle finger-picked acoustic coda. Includes download code. Cover by Japanese youth art sensation Okumura Mondo!",

            "about": "Long-planned reissue of Kawabata’s first solo LP, from way back in 2000 (about 100 releases ago, in Kawabata terms). Originally released by the mighty SIWA label in a tiny, hand printed edition of 300, this has long been the most sought-after Kawabata item, pretty much impossible to track down without a wallet full of ebay slush funds. The music, as on all of Kawabata’s INUI series releases, is intensely personal and introspective, with long tracks built up of soft-focus layers of mid-fi violin, sarangi, oud, sitar, bouzouki, etc. French film maker and musician Audrey Ginestet lends her crystal voice to “Shin.”",

            "about": "INUI 2 was the first widely available solo CD by this prolific Japanese guitarist/composer/bearded guru. Known primarily for his recent work with oddballs Acid Mothers Temple, Kawabata's career actually goes back to the late '70s and spans many styles, including solo guitar improv, electronics, folk, and, of course, the deranged acid mayhem associated with the PSF scene. Performed entirely solo on violin, kemenje, zurna, electronics, sarangi, taiko, gong, water, bouzouki, cello, vibes, organ, and sitar, the four tracks that make up INUI 2 are perfectly executed dream-music, equal parts delicately floating and heavily droning. There's also one all-too-short modal essay for bouzouki that is amazingly beautiful.",

            "about": "Third volume in an acclaimed series by the Acid Mothers Temple leader. INUI 3 focuses on Kawabata's highly personal brand of epic instrumental drone. Performing on bouzouki, sarangi, electric guitar, viola, and ECS-101, Makoto emphasizes the gradual build of monumental sound structures. Running 12 minutes each, \"Sui\" and \"Ken\" are darkly spun tales, with wisps of sound keening over a distant backdrop. Recalling the Speed Guru's lovely 2001 collaboration with Richard Youngs, the 47 minute \"Fuku\" is based on a hypnotic arpeggio plucked out on the bouzouki over which Gong-style glissando guitar and other zonked sounds are carefully layered.",

While widely and rightly known for ear-splitting Deep Purple style guitar demolition with Acid Mothers Temple, Gong, etc, Kawabata's INUI works are highly personal and introspective, with lots of room given to cosmic atmosphere and acoustic instruments. INUI 4 is a single 68 minute track, a slow building and evolving multi-layered swath of acoustic & electric guitars, electronics, and hurdy gurdy. The final 20 minutes of the track features prominent \"glissando\" guitar, ala Daevid Allen, a very fine sound to be lost in.",

            "about": "A sprawling follow-up to 1999's conceptual breakthrough Empty Bell Ringing In The Sky, Ayahuasca represented a comprehensive survey of the band's exponentially expanding world view during one of their most active periods. Recorded over a period of more than two years at various live and studio sessions, the sounds here are the start of what came after - Jack's \"Red Horse, White Mule\" and \"Opium Musick\" solo LPs, the Black Twigs, full-on Pelt acoustic shows, etc. Most striking about the record at the time was the inclusion of several traditional tunes, arranged for the group's eclectic instrumentation. While the band had been performing some acoustic material for several years and let some sneak out on the limited edition For Michael Hannas CDR, Ayahuasca was the first release to fully explore this part of their repertoire. \"The Cuckoo\" and 'Deep Sunny South\" are traditional Appalachian numbers, played and sung with considerable skill and feeling. The sawing bowed acoustic guitar on \"The Cuckoo\" and the rolling banjo and Tibetan bowl accompaniment on \"Deep Sunny South\" draw a direct line between raw/folk music traditions and the deep, visceral drone music that Pelt concentrated on prior to this record. The performances here have a balance of unpolished amateur electricity and reverence for the material that really only existed for a very short time - after this, the players rapidly expanding skills changed the sound forever. Combining the two styles neatly, \"A Raga Called John\" features Jack Rose's very, very fine country-blues/Fahey-influenced fingerstyle guitar over a shifting backdrop of hurdy-gurdy and concertina, before giving way to tanpuras overrun by fretless banjo. Of course, on top of all of this easily comprehensible music there's plenty of ear-cleansing ecstatic drone, from the two long flotation-inducing trios for bowed electrics and Esraj to the wall-shaking electric hurdy-gurdy mania of \"Bear Head Apparition.\" Truly a record for our times, such as they are.",

Contrary to the Grateful Dead reference in the title, “Skullfuck” is a tight recording of a single, intense November 2005 performance from NYC’s Knitting Factory. The set begins with an epic group arrangement of Jack Rose’s “Calais To Dover,” (from his Kensington Blues LP) with Jack’s 12 string shadowed by Mike Gangloff’s fiddle, and the thick drone of Mikel Dimmick and Pat Best’s Harmonium and Sruti’s. The three part “Bestio” suite follows, with the group moving to Tibetan bowls and gongs, building up a huge sheet of sound which peaks in a brief “encore” of wild gong smashing.",

            "about": "Debut long player by the \"classic\" Pelt trio. This out-of-nowhere blast of creativity followed a couple of 7\"s that were in a more \"rock\" style and was quite a revelation at the time (it's still good for listening, of course). Brown Cyclopaedia was originally issued as a dbl LP in mid-1995 on the band's own Radioactive Rat label (the precursor to Klang). The pressing was limited to 300 and most copies were given away, so it basically disappeared on release. The music features a lot of drifting but edgy stuff, mainly guitar oriented but with some unusual vocal, horn, etc touches that they turned more fully towards on the releases that followed.",

            "about": "First new studio recordings from Pelt in 3 years finds them picking up where 2005's Untitled CD left off - delivering massive slabs of heavy, all-acoustic drone action. \"Waning Crescent\" is an ominous workout for three large gongs, rich with overtones and subsonic rumble. \"Fire Signs Along the Field\" offers a slightly jarring quartet of spare string noise, with Nathan Bowles (Black Twigs, Spiral Joy Band) sitting in on double bass. \"Cast Out to Deep Waters\" is an immense 30 minute epic that fits into the archetypal classics in the Pelt canon, in the vein of \"Empty Bell Ringing in the Sky\" and Untitled's \"I.\" The all too brief \"Crown of Comets\" closes the album with the chiming, overlapping ring of bells recorded in Virginia's Falls Ridge caves.",
            "credits": "released March 27, 2020\nPatrick Best, Mike Gangloff, Mikel Dimmick\nwith Nathan Bowles playing bass on Fire Signs\nGongs, bowls, bells, harmoniums, fiddle, cello, bass, New Jupiter Machine\nAs always, thank you Sarah, Emily, Amy, Willa & Tycho, Bill.

Includes a 12 min collab with the rhBand, their complete 35 min Terrastock II set (claimed by many people as the highlight of the entire festival and earning them the nickname \"The Hillbilly Theater Of Eternal Music\"), a magically resonating 17 min slice from a typical east-coast warehouse hippie party, and finally, a brand new home 18 min recording heavy on the Tibetan Bowls (and by \"bowls\" I mean instruments, of course). The live recordings are all of the digital variety and finally capture the sheer density and multi-layered force of their live sound.",

            "about": "Max Meadows was the third full-length release by Virginia trio Pelt. Recorded all over the place in studio, rehearsal, and live settings, combines the Dead C-like downer song-craft heard on their early releases with the massive group drone soon to take over their sound. Use of a wide variety of unusual instruments, including those of their own design, came into full bloom here and gives Pelt a sound very much removed from other groups working this side of the street. \"Outside Listening\" and \"Sun Is Standing\" send out lengthy waves of bliss via electric guitar, both ethereal and gritty at the same time. \"Hippy War Machine\" organizes the mass percussion heard on those old Amon Duul LP's and backs it with a powerful drone. \"Dismal Falls\" serves as a fitting coda to such an exhaustive listen, with its eerie, melodic banjo and bowed cymbals.",

            "about": "All acoustic epics from the \"classic\" Pelt trio lineup of Jack Rose, Mike Gangloff, and Patrick Best. Recorded in a single March 2003 session in VA by Mikel Dimmick, this was a superb distillation of their interests at the time (both alone and together - Jack's first solo records, the emergence of the Black Twigs as a busy working band, etc). \"Up the North Fork\" is a trio for banjo, baritone banjo, and cello - after the snakey bowed introduction, the fast thwacking of the banjos and forcefully strummed cello take over and whip up a storm. The other two tracks are lengthy ragas (one in C, one in D) with the virtuoso modal guitar of Jack Rose front and center. \"Pearls From The River\" features Jack on 12 string, dueling with Mike Gangloff on Esraj. Pat Best's thick, sonorous double bass bowing anchors the duet between the lightning thrumming/plucking of Jack's guitar and mike's arcing, sharply bowed half-time melody. \"Road To Catawba\" has Jack on 6 string, with Mike moving to tamboura. Best's bass is again the foundation, with whistling overtones rising from his bow over the low drone.",

Recorded in New Orleans and Austin on the band's monumental spring 1998 tour (which yielded their masterpiece Empty Bell Ringing In The Sky), Rob's Choice gives you a listen to 2 nearly complete performances, both superb expressions of the band's higher ground drone myth expansion and contraction, uh, that is to say it wails, and who doesn't love that Lowrey tube organ? Plus, there's the very special addition of Tom Carter (Charalambides) on sax and time-lag accumulator on the Austin performance.",

            "about": "Pelt's mix of traditional (acoustic instruments, folk/ethnic music traditions) and contemporary (about 1 million super-weird noise and avant-garde records) reached a new peak on Técheöd (pronounced \"Tey-hoood\"). Using tamboura, guitar, violin, tabla, banjo, flute, lap steel, oscillator, voice, organ, and a variety of other instruments both conventional and home-made, Pelt issue forth a massive and extraordinary gust of sound. A logical follow up to 1997's well received Max Meadows CD, Técheöd captures the band at home in their living room, and live in Washington DC. \"New Dehli Blues\" leads off the record with 14 minutes of ecstatic Indian-inspired modal trance. \"Big Walker Mountain Tunnel\" follows with its massive wall of sound tempered by a carefully stitched melodic motif. \"Mu Mesons\" finishes off the record with a home-cooking version of the type of tape-loop exotica explored by composers like Terry Riley and Steve Reich.",

            "about": "(untitled) is a devastating set of almost pure white light. The intense drone music on (untitled) represents a return to \"sonic-ism\" for the quartet of Jack Rose, Mike Gangloff, Patrick Best, and Mikel Dimmick. Like Pelt's 2003 effort Pearls from the River, (untitled) is an all-acoustic affair. On (untitled) the group concentrates on producing dense clouds of overtones from guitar, cello, tibetan bowls, gongs, sruti, and esraj. Track 1 is an overpowering straight line ala the Theatre of Eternal Music, an atmosphere of stasis with gong and bowl flickering subtly over the massive track bed. Track 2 is a 32 minute epic that begins with the soft strains of Jack Rose's 12 string, picks up dueling cello and esraj and gradually builds in intensity with the sounds of gongs and other unusual percussion. Track 3 is the live staple \"Sundogs,\" where Rose's Weissenborn lap guitar and Gangloff's resonator guitar produce a stream of unearthly high, singing overtones in an uncanny acoustic impression of electric feedback. The final track is an epilogue of Best's keening cello, again ignoring the usual technique associated with the instrument in the pursuit of pure weirdness.",

            "about": "Outrageous album of prog rock from Richard Youngs and Andrew Paine's ILK. Canticle is a long promised follow-up to the group's 1998 CD Zenith, which was released on Richard's No Fans label. Unlike Richard's more \"minimalist\" solo records, Ilk drapes his songs and voice in thick layers of heavy jams, and then piles on the production tricks, vocal layers, Steve Howe-style leads, synth bleeps, and other racket in beautifully intricate arrangements. Canticle is clearly influenced by the classic UK progressives but unmistakably contemporary. \"A Guiding Principle\" and \"Landsong\" marry Richard and Andrew's multi-tracked voices with over the top full rock-band arrangements. \"Honour's Prospect\" mixes mystical narration with some searing fuzz-guitar leads, and is followed by the bass-heavy march of \"The Weight of Stars.\" \"Tilling\" shimmers and echoes, leading into the spacey and cosmic \"Outward & Homeward.\" The folky \"Of Souls\" serves as a fittingly simple epilogue to the suite. Veronica Rennie's cover art completes the package in highly appropriate style.",

            "about": "The untitled album of duets by the nowadays unavoidable Acid Mothers Temple leader Kawabata Makoto and Richard Youngs shows the pair in a relaxed, yet psychedelic mood. The five untitled tracks here play simple modal melodies performed on acoustic guitar, autoharp, organ, voice etc against swirling production and layers of shifting audio haze. Track 1 has Richard's immediately identifiable voice, guitar, and autoharp against Kawabata's spacey echo treatments - track 3 reverses the process with Richard's minor key picking cutting against Kawabata's thick, visceral bowed drones. Tracks 2, 4, and 5 all use a base of lovely fingerpicked guitar melodies, layering on organ, synth, tape effects, and echo until a suitably mellow cosmic vibe is achieved. All in all, some of the most beautiful sounds ever issued by either of these two gents, best known for their edgy experimental work.",

            "about": "NO FANS COMPENDIUM is a deluxe limited edition 7 CD set of Richard Youngs’ recordings for his long-running private NO FANS label. 5 CDs are Richard’s personal selection from his NO FANS releases, all of which were issued in tiny editions (20 – 50) and only available for sale at Richard’s rare shows or at Glasgow’s now defunct Volcanic Tongue shop. In addition, Richard has included two full discs of material previously unavailable in any form - a recording from 1989 pre-dating his earliest widely-known work, and a new recording from late 2014. Unbeatable as a survey of Richard’s career, everything here is of equal quality to his over-the-counter releases. In keeping with his penchant for unpredictable stylistic mashups and reinventions, there are folky laments, achingly beautiful “songs,” tape collage, rude prog noise, minimalist experiments, multi-tracked vocals, etc.",

            "about": "Second collaboration between these two stalwart titans of the true UK underground, coming 8 years after their first pairing on the Site/Realm LP. Relayer (the title no doubt a nod to the odd resemblance of 7 year old Rosalie Bower's cover art to another LP of the same title) throws out the live methodology of the LP for a dense set of layered studio recordings. Like the music of Bower's Sunroof! group, the tracks are rainbows of colors and textures with string drone, percussion, bleeps, and the unidentifiable competing in a mix devoid of the traditional \"lead with backing\" schema. Many tracks have the kind of welcoming electronic bed seldom heard since the demise of Harmonia, with ring modulated fuzz bleeping away over a chugging, but non-oppressive beat. Elsewhere, there's Youngs' Riley-style organ ping-pong, a little virtuoso Kalimba, thick wads of analog synth....you know where this is going.",

            "about": "\"20 Years\" is a celebration of 20 years of music from Richard and Simon, featuring 4 previously unreleased albums. The set includes an all new LP, \"20 Years,\" that is the first new vinyl from R!!! and S!!! in almost 15 years. The other three projects presented here on CD were all completed and intended for release by the duo during their prolific 1990's, but fell by the wayside for various reasons.\n\"20 Years\" is a newly recorded LP, and is one of the heaviest, most uncompromising records of Richard and Simon's long career. The record consists of 8 electro-acoustic reworkings of their first (unreleased) recording from 1987, and is a blistering set of tracks as wild and weird as anything they've ever recorded.\n\"SMIRR\" consists of 4 epic instrumentals in the vein of classics such as \"LAKE\" and \"Asthma and Diabetes,\" flowing with extended grandeur, mixing drone and eccentric instrumentation in the duo's immediately identifiable style.\n\"Songphase\" is a record of 10 simple, lovely tunes - a reminder of the duo's considerable \"trad\" songwriting and performing prowess. While Richard has worked some in this style in his solo efforts, hearing Simon match him song for song is a revelation. \"Dream Song\" is among Richard's most moving pieces ever.\nFinally, \"LIVE!!!\" is a head-scratcher of a live album, recorded live in-studio in full on Dada-ist style. Features extended clavinet mania, Casio jams, and plenty of outre' expression.",

            "about": "\"5 Years\" is the venerable duo's first release since \"Lammergeier\" (vhf#58) in 2000. After recording and releasing nearly 20 albums between 1990 and 2000, Richard and Simon decided to try a novel and opposite approach to music making - they met once each year to record a solitary 10 minute track. The results show the duo remarkably unaffected by the half decade that elapsed - the tracks on \"5 Years\" reflect their long established signature mix of \"real human\" instrumental expression and explosive musique concrete sensibility. \"2002\" starts with several minutes of looped snippets building up subtle patterns as they slide in and out of phase, leading to a change to a tremulous chord organ driven section. \"2003\" starts with a drastically filtered base of hand drumming, with full-on hand-on-the-knob tweaking, before giving way to an over the top fuzz organ solo that sounds like Mike Ratledge on 200 rpm. \"2004\" is a throwback of ululating noise as heard on 90's efforts such as \"Metallic Sonatas.\" \"2005\" is based on electronically treated percussion, the sparest and most minimal track of the bunch. Recorded mere weeks before release, \"2006\" finishes where we started, with a baffling electronic test pattern drone that segues into a section of beautiful, weird ambience.",

            "about": "Originally issued in an edition of 300 on their No Fans label and for all intents and purposes unavailable and unheard for a decade, the 10th anniversary CD-ification of Richard and Simon's classic debut double-LP still sounds as revelatory and alien as it did when it was released. Tracks like the immortal collage freak-out \"Dance: Help The Aged (Give Them A Heart Attack),\" the minimal pulse epic \"Chord\" and the psych-fuzz rock mania of \"Goat\" have been undiluted in their majesty by the unbearable decade that has elapsed between then and now. Highest rating. Remastered from the original 1/4\" analog reels, sounding much improved over the original pressing. New liner notes by Simon. 4 (really 15) tracks, 73 mins.\n\"We're listening to LAKE close on a decade since we recorded it. Just as it sounds odd now, what we do today would've sounded bizarre then. We couldn't make this record now. It's like a ghost - so long ago. We've moved on. Our label name, No Fans, was a statement of fact; the record was a dare to ourselves - who in their right mind would ever release anything like this? With No Fans, No Distribution and No Prospect of either, spending over 1,000 pounds on a vanity project when most of our peers were doing sensible things smacked of arrogance. In an ironic bid to launch Lake, a Goat Evening was held in Nottingham at the home of Neil Campbell and Jim Plaistow. Though everyone had a good time, by the end of the evening no-one had bought the album, so we gave away copies to the three people who had shown any interest. Which left 297 copies. The situation was more ridiculous than ever.\"\n--Simon Wickham-Smith",

            "about": "LAmmERGEIER is the first new recording by Richard and Simon since Metallic Sonatas recorded way way back in the spring of 1998. Following closely on the heels of the VHF reissue of the duo's classic 1990 debut LAKE, LAmmerGEIER finds the duo continuing to pursue the head-scratching assortment and range of outer sound in a somewhat more contemporary style. LAmmERGEIR makes use of all sorts of exotic instruments, but like Metallic Sonatas, many of the pieces have undergone electronic transformation, adding an extra layer of ??? to the tunes. Some of the sounds show the influence of Simon's laptop work over the last couple of years, tho' the duo now claim that this is an all analog deal. Laptops aside, the layers of microscopic detail on LAmmERGEIER should give listeners plenty of practice in differentiating sounds that are produced by complicated software or tape loops or whatever, and sounds that are produced by a guy whacking a baking tray with a stick.",

            "about": "Recorded in 1998 just prior to Simon's (as it turned out, temporary) relocation to Australia. In contrast to the song-oriented action of Pulse Of The Rooster, Metallic Sonatas is 15 short slices of searing, electronic-sounding mayhem. Performed on Electric Sitar, Voice, Glass Harmonica, Drum Machine, Electric Cifteli, Electric Banjolin, Violin, Cello, Cardboard Boxes, Casio, Electric Shirt-Reinforcer, Electric Bass, Guitar, Bowed Cymbals, Electric Thai Harp, Clockchimes, Reed Organ, and Bagpipes, the sounds have been mutated into towering alien sculptures evoking the \"texture\" of metals. Each piece is short and novel-sounding enough not to slip into dreary repetition and like most of R!!!&S!!!’s releases, somehow makes the most unusual music accessible. Out of print for many, many years.",

            "about": "Pulse Of The Rooster is R!!!&S!!!'s self-proclaimed \"psychedelic\" album. What jumps out from this record is how prominent the vocals are, with every track containing substantial vocalizing. Richard and Simon's untutored-but-just-right singing fits perfectly with their eccentric kitchen-sink approach, and gives the music an identifiably English melodic sensibility. Behind the vocals is a sometimes howling, sometimes gentle miasma of electric dulcimer, casio, drums, electric bass, electric guitar, electric sitar, thai harp, violin, glockenspiel, penny whistle, and shakuhachi. The record even features a couple of nods to period psychedelia with some wacky production tricks.",
            "credits": "released December 1, 2017\nRichard and Simon sing and play: bowed electric Appalachian dulcimer; Casio; drum machine; electric bass guitar; electric cifteli; electric sitar; electric thai harp; electric violin; glockenspiel; penny whistles (Bb and F); shakuhachi; silence.\nRecorded Harpenden, England, 3-5 June 1997\nThank you to Kaiser Mark for loan of bass guitar, to Lucinda McNair for taking the photograph; & to Yasuko Nakajima for translation and calligraphy",

            "about": "Third VHF release for this southwest Virginia ensemble that specializes in transportational sound sheets. Derived from the extended Pelt/Jack Rose/Black Twigs family, Spiral Joy traffics in lengthy microtonal explorations rooted in the expansive tradition of beards like Taj Mahal Travellers, Henry Flynt, Theatre of Eternal Music, etc. The four tracks here are an evolution from the trance-like gong and percussion sounds of recent Joy Band releases, with the quartet putting more of an emphasis on heavily bowed string sounds. Gangloff's fiddle, which plays it relatively straight in the Black Twigs (and occasionally Pelt), cuts loose here with some of the gnarliest string scratching this side of Tony Conrad's \"Four Violins,\" giving the music a searing, visceral edge. The final track finds the band literally standing in the Atlantic Ocean, with their gongs and Tibetan bowls shimmering out a gentle lullaby. \"No overdubs, No amplification, No effects.\"",

            "about": "Debut album by this long running but until now undocumented Virginia group. Founded in 2001 by Pelt members Mikel Dimmick and Mike Gangloff with Karl Precoda (Last Days of May, The Dream Syndicate), the Joy Band concentrates on live performances featuring marathon unorthodox drone treatises for acoustic instruments, including Tibetan singing bowl, gong, sruti, and esraj. The bowed, rolled, and (usually) gently struck metal percussion anchors the sound with rich, resonating tones. The music is a cousin to Pelt's explorations on (Untitled) (vhf#90) and Keyhole & Keyhole II (both on Eclipse). Lullaby 1 is almost entirely built on the gongs and bowls, a slowly building narcoleptic trip. The 41 minute epic Lullaby 2 begins with Gangloff on esraj, building up a trance before the shenais and sharply struck gongs take over at the climax of the piece. Lullaby 3 throws some surprisingly melodic and active piano into the mix, evoking a long-form version of Popol Vuh's \"Die Nacht Der Seele.\"",

            "about": "Wake of the Dying Sun King is the second full length of epic meditative drone from this southwest VA collective. Like Pelt (with which it shares several members), Spiral Joy Band uses mostly acoustic instruments to create slow building pieces rich with human detail. The steady rolling of multiple Tibetan bowls, bowed and struck gongs, hypnotic fiddle, sruti box, and other instruments are recorded live in continuous performances that frequently stretch beyond an hour per piece. The performance aspect is key to SJB's aura - the variations in tone, approach, force, etc with which each tone is played and the clear, open recording (mostly in Blacksburg's Glade Baptist Church) highlight the subtleties of the music. \"Wake\" is a much more percussive set of music than SJB's previous \"Lullabies for Jeff Dean\" CD (vhf#94), with Nathan Bowles' expert percussion lending a lot more clang to the mix.

            "about": "Unstoppable collection from long in the tooth UK viber Matthew Bower and friends (who here include Neil Campbell, Rosalie Bower, Richard Youngs, and Jazzfinger). The atmosphere here is mostly spaced and buzzing with instruments and voices hovering and floating in the dense mix, the tunes all running together like some sort of alien shortwave broadcast. Disc 1 takes off from where \"Found Star Sound\" left us, with a mix of fuzzy guitar and organ rhythms jousting with voice, bowed strings, and unidentifiable percussion in a dense fog. Disc 2 is a headlong rush into newish territory, with analog synth vs. birdsong, child's voice vs. sawing violin, chug vs. fizz, etc. There are many tracks on both discs that have subtle (and overt) melodic and rhythmic undercurrents that suggest some sort of alternate fuzz/hiss-dominated universe version of say, Harmonia or Richter Band. Probably a coincidence, but very, very appealing.",

Layers of twinkling keyboard, guitar, unidentified fuzz, short wave, etc. One of their best and most immediately accessible. Very much in the style of Harmonia/Cluster in spots. There's a couple of amped-up moments here, including surprise lead guitar action on \"tornado rose canoe,\" and the excellent fuzzgrilled rock of \"Primavera.\" \"Best Sunroof Ever\" - Neil Campbell.",

Quiet since the release of 2007’s blistering Panzer Division Lou Reed (vhf#105), Sunroof! returns here with a more introspective set, reaching back to the fuzzy, spacey sounds of releases like the epic double Bliss. Amongst the drifting, fuzzed out washes of sound, there’s the crude, Dead C-like riffing in “Lions & Peonies” and the lockgrooved tremolo of “Son of the Blue Wolf” (referencing previous triumphs like my personal fave Sunroof! Cloudz).\n“I have a problem w/ the term ‘psychedelia’ ; negative associations of a ‘hippie’ falseness, nevertheless my arte is, I know, deeply psychedelic in a true sense, a kind of synaesthesisia, a scrambling, an overload that seeks Samadhi in its primal gush, that will reconnect one with the all, or rather, a ‘black psychedelia’, substituting the elective current, for ‘all’…” – Matthew Bower\nIn addition to the all-new tracks on the LP, the package also includes a bonus CD (in a separate sleeve) featuring an MB-curated overview of his work. Many of the tracks on the 75 min Zebra Blood CD are from scarce or out of print recordings, including “Austrian Shade” from an impossible-to-find Total 7”. Also included is the epic and exclusive new track SPIRIT ANIMAL DANZIG.",

            "about": "Spacy and sorta mellow follow up to 2000's monster double pack debut Delicate Autobahn Under Construction. Recorded mostly at Bower's Cumbrian home in the rainy and windy UK \"lake\" district, Found Star Soundlayers droning guitars, organs, violin, and voice with intermittent twinkling percussion to evoke an atmosphere perfectly suited to such an environment. Following a short living-room-organ-with-built in-rhythm-section-gone-crazy intro on \"Pink Stream 1,\" the album builds a vibe around Bower's thickly buzzing (but smooth n' mild) guitar. Steadily picking up momentum, the music peaks with the chugging sound of trains epic \"Pink Stream 2,\" calms briefly , and then goes out strong with a rousing blast of guitar and violin scrape on \"Silvera.\" \"Another scuff from the UK's biggest scuffmakers!\" - Seymour Glass.",

            "about": "Beneath the usual lovely psychedelic artwork on the cover of Panzer Division Lou Reed lurks Sunroof’s most explosive and assaultive record ever. The key track here in the Sunroof! evolution is the opening “Slew Plateaus #1,” with Mick Flower (Vibracathedral Orchestra) on guitar and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man) on drums. This live shot of electricity gradually ramps up from Matt Bower and Mick Flower’s dueling guitars to when Moloney’s drums come crashing in after about six minutes, leading to a furious crescendo that lasts for the remainder of the 19 minute track. “Slew Plateaus #2” is a lengthy collaboration with underground gadabout Mattin, whose previous collabs with Tony Conrad, Bruce Russell, Eddie Prevost et al hopefully prepared him for the MB wrecking ball which is delivered here. The other two cuts are absolutely blistering demolition work, which in spite of their visceral impact, reach a state of zen-like stasis after a couple of minutes, ala the best of MB’s work with Hototogisu.",

            "about": "An epic double CD of inimitable buzz from the long running Sunroof! team. Recorded over a period where Matt Bower concentrated on his duo Hototogisu (with Marcia Bassett of Double Lepoards), \"Silver Bear Mist\" backtracks from recent joints like the collag-y \"USSA,\" \"Splat,\" and \"Wings Over America,\" and the last major Sunroof! release - the krautrock-ish \"Cloudz\" (vhf#75) - to revel in thick billowing fuzz bombs. Aided by Vibracathedral Orchestra's Mick Flower and US duo the Skaters, MB lets rip on \"rockers\" like the Tibetan-oriented \"Buried in the Sky\" and the immense \"Sky Blue Sword.\" Disc 2 mixes it up a bit, with the unexpectedly docile \"Stacked Diamonds\" featuring the Skaters, alongside the scouring surge of MB leads on \"Be Sure to Boogie\" and \"Luminous Kite.\"",

            "about": "First ever VHF release by the 21-years-running Ashtray Navigations, bringing one more core piece of the UK freakout underground back to the mothership. With a discography that boggles even the most ardent Discogs user and an on-point WTF graphic sensibility, Ash Nav fits perfectly into the extremely fertile and prolific scene that has produced titans like Vibracathedral Orchestra and Sunroof!. On this generous 100 minute package, Phil Todd and Melanie O’Dubshlaine essay a kind of guitar and electronics exotica, with burbling rhythms, Heldon-like laser guitar leads, field recordings, synth racket, etc – the totally fun take on Les Baxter’s all-time classic “Quiet Village” (here wittily retitled “Quite Village”) is a good example of the explorer spirit at work here. Considering the amount of unhinged psychedelic fuzzwah lead damage laid out across this thing, it’s arguably the most effusive guitar heroics record of the genre, hopefully inspiring a new generation of young rockers out there to get on the bus.",
            "credits": "released June 8, 2017\nPerformed by Phil Todd and Melanie O'Dubhslaine 2012-2014. 3 and 9 basic tracks recorded live at the Old Hairdressers Glasgow by Stuart Arnot and Susan Fitzpatrick. 10 originally released on CD by Makrame Records.",

            "about": "Long planned (and frequently delayed) restoration of this Virginia trio's rare and out of print singles and compilation tracks from the early 90's. All 30 tracks make their first appearance on CD/digital here, restoring two of the earliest vhf titles to print, along with a wealth of other impossible to find gems. Covering their most active years, \"Add This to Rhetoric\" captures Sloat at their baffling, fragmentary best, dealing out slashing rock sides that bristle with hooks and ear-catching weirdness. Sloat's superbly packaged, handmade/homemade singles were among the finest of their era, and although they appear here on a plain ol' download/CD, the music still sounds as revelatory as it did 15 years ago. Rifling through ideas with Wire-like efficiency, Pat Foster's trebly, jabbing guitar, Ange Dubuc's rumbling bass, and Dave Bishop's unpredictable drum splatter carried the charge that pretty much invented the VHF label itself. Wearing their influences on their sleeves, the album includes smashing covers of key tracks by the Clean, Tall Dwarfs, Sun City Girls, and World of Pooh.",

            "about": "Second VHF solo LP from the Pelt/Black Twigs mainstay, following 2022’s acclaimed “Evening Measures.” “April is Passing” builds on the striking solo Hardanger-style fiddle performances on the previous LP to take the music even further out, with deep drones and extended techniques defining a vocabulary that is Americana-adjacent, but a unique and special sound that Mike is pursuing almost alone. Joined on selected tracks by Cara Gangloff’s Sruti and Kaily Shenker’s sonorous Cello, the all-original, all-live performances are resonant with both overt melody and a cloud of thick string overtones, whether on the more upbeat tunes like “Ironto Dancer” or the epic 11+ minute LP closer “Helen’s Song.” “September Air” is a mournful slow build, the fiddle embroidering a minor-key melody over the drone of the Surti box and a low cello counter point. “A Fallen Palace of Snowville” is a solo performance where the additional sympathetic strings of the hardanger fiddle are strongly heard as a ghostly accompaniment, as Mike’s elegant melody switches back and forth from minor to major. “Helen’s Song” closes side 2 with a complex, ever-changing swirl of melodic and harmonic invention, with Mike’s keening, languorous bowing leading the way through multiple moods and sounds.",

            "about": "Boggling double CD of all kinds of crazy stuff. Listening to this 20 years after it was recorded, the first disc isn't too far off what groups like Vibracathedral later mined (but with a full drum kit). The second disc is a crazy mash up of every kind of underground madness imaginable.I guess double CD's of full-on mania are fairly common now, but at the time this package seemed pretty ambitious/nuts. Art Ensemble offers up 4 tracks which progress from hypnotic to bizarre to intricate to ambient in that order. There is some fine free-playing here, shot through with a roughness that keeps it visceral. Disc 2 takes a near random look through the Rake archives and turns up ear-splitting noise rock, tuneful jams, incompetent guitar tuning, found sounds, long stretches stolen from other people's records, an angry confrontation with a man about the parking lot of the Herndon Rec Center, 10 seconds of Dylan's \"Stuck Inside Mobile w/The Memphis Blues Again,\" and that's just for starters.",

            "about": "Second full length from NY based guitarist Turnquist, who defies expectations with a set of hypnotic epics that owe more to classic minimalism than current notions of solo guitar. Forgoing most of the extended techniques of his debut, Turnquist concentrates on laying down a thick blanket of 12 string that sets up persistent loop-like patterns in the music. Simple and lovely strings, piano, and percussion accompaniment provide the melody, carrying most of the movement in the pieces. The palette of sounds and styles here is used with extraordinary control and restraint - the orchestrations are as reductionist as possible, with no cringe-inducing \"string drama\" or unnecessary virtuosity. The almost monomaniacal tremolo thrum of the guitar dominates the album, but there is a lengthy ambient breakdown that occurs midway through the 18 minute \"The REM Cycle - Dream Phase\" that is a thing of elliptical and drifting beauty. \"As The Twilight Crane\" is a bold statement even in the context of the frequent micro-parsing of styles in the sub-underground - there's really not much else out there like it.",

            "about": "S!!!'s first solo CD, Butterfly Dust is 3 pieces for organ, voice, woodwind, and didgeridoo. The performances on Butterfly Dust are informed by a rare combination of virtuosity and exploratory improvisation different from Simon's equally revelatory computer music. In comparison with some prior performances (e.g. Simon’s startlingly skilled assault on a grand piano on Youngs/Wickham-Smith's Knish), BD is in a more minimal style, where sounds are given room to build up and establish a mood over the long term. This is particularly true of the long organ solo \"Objects Appearing,\" where notes are slowly added to a drone over a period of several minutes, giving each newly introduced note a significant impact. Recorded in Australia.",

            "about": "Deluxe triple-pack CD that restores two classic Skullflower albums to print, with a bonus disc of contemporaneous singles. Recorded together and originally conceived as a double CD back in the dark ages of 1995, \"Carved Into Roses\" and \"Infinityland\" find the band making a transition from the \"heavy\" riffs of their early days to a more free-form sound that continues to this day to drive leader Matthew Bower's many guises (Skullflower, Sunroof!, Hototogisu, Mirag, etc). Sporting a revamped lineup of Bower, Stuart Dennison, Russell Smith, and Phillip Best, the band whacks away at both styles simultaneously, with lumbering hooks meeting rainbows of coruscating feedback. Both records start with lengthy two chord modal jams, anchored by the guest organ of Simon Wickham-Smith (he appears on most tracks on both CD's). \"Pipe Dream\" and \"The Idiotsburgh Address\" sport structures that wouldn't have been out of place on a 1960's Pharaoh Sanders album, but with the spiraling sound of Bower and Smith's (of UK scuzz legend Terminal Cheesecake) guitars tearing up the sound bed. Smith's replacement of Anthony \"Ax\" DiFranco in the band's lineup is a key element in the sound, with the two guitar/no bass configuration sounding at times like a UK version of the Dead C. \"White Fang's\" slashing riff and Michael Morley style vocal (by Best) are a tip of the hat to the New Zealand band's key works (which basically came out at the same time as these records). Elsewhere, there's the \"classic\" drone and low end menace of tracks like \"Abraxas\" and \"Blood Orange,\" the galloping drum signature on \"Metallurgical King\" and the live mayhem midway thru Carved that makes it clear that this was a real working outfit that laid down a distinct statement of purpose and identity on these two records.\nThe Singles disc collects both sides (over 50 minutes) of the 4 7\" records that were released around the same time and made largely by the same lineup. Not exactly a \"singles band,\" SF nevertheless has made more than a dozen of the format over the years. The alternate take on \"White Fang\" is even more jagged and crackling than the LP take. \"Choady Foster\" and \"Spent Force\" are huge pools of sound. Among these more straightforward tunes are oddities like the live version of \"Metallurgical King,\" and the two sides of the \"Village Sorting\" single, a studio recording featuring Tim Hodgkinson (Henry Cow, the Work) blowing the roof off the place on alto.",

            "about": "The 1994 debut LP by this long running group of homeowners takes the lame constraints of rock music and chucks them in the river. I guess you could call this \"indie rock\" but it has none of the lame implications of that tag - it's neither overweening nor slavishly secondhand. In the style of say Wire or Swell Maps, Wingtip take devices such as verses and choruses and split them into prickly shards of lyrical sound. Inventive, angular, occasionally angry, and yet possessing an offhand \"catchy\" charm that so many bands work hard to possess but can't. The expressionistic lyrics are good and given an appropriately pointed delivery.",

            "about": "\"Doubles\" is the first widely-available release by Irish guitarist Cian Nugent, a showcase of major talent in an audacious setting of two side-long epics. Clearly inspired by the Takoma-classics and the recent generation of greats (Rose, Jones, etc), Cian delivers two perfectly formed takes on the classic steel-string sound, one (mostly) unaccompanied, the other an expertly arranged full-band throwdown. \"Peaks & Troughs\" is a slow-building solo piece in the style of Fahey's \"Fare Forward Voyagers,\" with each part perfectly connected to the previous. Cian has ample technique, but the virtuosity here is all in service of the mood and the build up. His guitar has a darker, more intimate sound than many current players, without the brittle ring common to fingerstyle. The emergence of a deep drone after 15 minutes shakes up the track, like a swarm of bees spilling out of the speakers. In contrast, \"Sixes & Sevens\" is a percolating jam in the style of Jim O'Rourke's classic LP \"Bad Timing,\" with Cian's steel string riding an inventive wave of drums, organ, viola, woodwinds, and brass in an ambitious, filmic masterpiece. The main tune of the song is instantly memorable, building momentum before a subdued interlude that resets things for an elegant, orchestrated finish.",

            "about": "Remarkable debut LP by new Cosmic-Appalachian string band, birthed from the same Virginia firmament that has brought you Pelt, Jack Rose, Black Twig Pickers, and Spiral Joy Band. Led by Mike Gangloff’s droning fiddle and Matt Peyton’s fingerpicked guitar, Eight Point Star mines the modal traditions of both old-time Appalachia and far-out drone music to produce beautiful tunes that are equal parts memorable and psychedelic. Side A starts with the gentle guitar and fiddle duet of “Winchester’s Dream” before segueing into the loping “Waiting on the Band,” where the subliminal pulse of Tim Thornton’s upright bass animates the music until the lengthy lock-groove repetition of “The Interloper.” Closing the side, “Flowerthrower” and “Mount-Calvary Peacock” have a vibe reminiscent of Popol Vuh’s mid-70’s masterpieces, combining sawing fiddle and melodic guitar with simple and haunting chord structures. Side B is bookended by two country-blues influenced numbers, with Matt Peyton’s boisterous vocal and guitar and Isak Howell’s harp leading the upbeat “Brand New Shirt” and the elegiac “Weeping Cherry Cry.” In between the two vocal features are a segued mini-epic of moods, including an expanded group lineup collapsing midway through “A Water Panther Speaks” into an eerie soundscape of singing bowls and distant gong sounds as dark as the night in remotest Virginia.",

            "about": "Epic double set from the duo, combining an LP of all-electric rock mayhem with a CD (in its own color card sleeve) of subtle drum/shakuhachi duos. Electric Lotus is the boys' self-proclaimed \"rock\" album, and it is a mind-boggling clutch of guitar/bass/drums demolition. Coming off like an amphetamine-fueled Guru Guru, the music tumbles out in a crazy quilt of stun-level attack zonage, especially on the side-long \"Electric Lotus.\" Neilson's staggering free-drumming hits a new peak here, stepping beyond his laudable work with Jandek, Bonny Prince Billy, etc into new realms. Youngs lights it up with raging guitar and bass action, including some deeply psychedelic leads, and on \"Kickin' The Glass,\" some killer \"heavy\" riffing.\nLotus Edition is a companion CD of restrained and completely live duos for drums and shakuhachi. Youngs had previously issued a disc of shakuhachi solos with dense delay and layering effects, but here his untrained but highly musical output on the ancient instrument is in deep conversation with Neilson's drum set. A couple of the tracks feature the kind of long notes, bowed cymbals, and other droneage heard on previous releases like \"Partick Rain Dance,\" but in a stripped down live setting.",

            "about": "First in a series of 3 LPs of Library Music miniatures from composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O’Sullivan (Æthenor, Ulver, This is Not This Heat, etc). For heads, the term “Library Music” in 2020 might evoke dodgy Italian gray market LPs and crate diggers hunting for “funky breaks” - but London’s venerable KPM Music is working with groundbreakers like Daniel to open up new avenues for composers to experiment. Electric Māyā includes 18 gems, beautifully arranged and recorded specifically for the challenge of the short form. These are fully realized tunes, not just clips from the middle of some jam to be used on late night TV. The obvious touchstones here are Eno’s On Land and Music for Films, but Dan’s touch on multiple instruments and knack for melody extend the music far beyond mere atmospherics. There are plenty of drifty segments, each rendered fully realized - a timely reminder that a well-made drone or bit of ambience can set its spell in 2 or 3 minutes rather than 30. In a beautiful jacket designed by Dan and Turner Prize-nominee Mark Titchner.\n“Library music. Akasha. Here you accept that music behaves like a thing to accentuate another thing, seemingly unrelated. A beautiful, shining blankness. Not passive. An opportunity to wade. A brief encounter with an open-ended destiny. As in, you never know who or what it will be partnered with. With library music the emphasis tends to be on functionality and less on sonic self-portraiture. So it compels you to be concise, like what is the function of this work? The distance is liberating. It’s less “What Am I? and more “What Is This?”. It compels you to be brief, each little cell is a world of its own in an assemblage of miniatures all vibrating in their collective identity. Then there is the occult nature of library music which is fetishized by many for its ability to induce time travel, often to send us back to some televisual memory. However, despite its broad-brush strokes, the library can be so profoundly alien, especially when experienced independently of the televisual realm; an unruly chimera of genre mutations, compositional curiosities and the deepest wallpaper you ever laid ears on. Perhaps the observances of library music can help unshackle us from our artistic insecurities and delusions, where one is drawn to the shape of music as a whole instrument unto itself; as a vehicle carrying our intention and consisting of everything we have to give at that moment; so things that are seemingly unrelated are ultimately connected.” – Daniel O’Sullivan",

            "about": "Originally developed as a part-time \"solo\" outlet for Skullflower guitarist Matthew Bower, Total's prolific output has in some ways eclipsed the achievements of the now-defunct legendary band. Using a droning electric guitar and/or organ in a variety of tones ranging from excoriating to elegiac, Total's music envelops the listener in a haze of overtones variously evoking Indian music, machine noise, nature sounds, and monolithic power. John Godbert (egyptian double reed) and Neil Campbell (violin) occasionally embellish the sound with their unusual instruments. EBF represents a more \"accessible,\" carefully-edited look at Total than some of their recent releases while not giving back one iota of hallucenogenic power.",
            "credits": "released August 4, 2017\nInstruments and tapes by Matthew Bower, with John Godbert and Neil Campbell towards the end. The title is from Thomas Traherne.\nThanks go to Phillip Best, Richard Youngs, Ben & Has, Rosalie & Daniel, and especially my muse, Muddy.",

            "about": "First solo LP in a decade from long-time Pelt/Black Twigs/Eight Point Star leader, presenting a remarkable program of solo Hardanger and octave fiddle music. Evening Measures is a bold and unique statement, a direct and disarming individual expression of a musician’s inner thoughts and inspirations. Like some of Mike’s work in other projects, this ricochets back and forth across the line between the most traditional and the most “out” music, blending drone, melody, and the pure tactile sensation of acoustic string music into a personal sound. A set of all-original compositions (save the traditional “Wild Geese Chase”), Mike’s playing is languorous and expressive, with the sympathetic strings of the Hardanger-style instrument ringing out on some cuts like multiple players. The album touches on a variety of styles, keeping things fresh for the entire playing time. “The Other Side of Catawba” is a deeply psychedelic and immersive cloud of hovering string sound, reminiscent of some of Pelt’s more gentle explorations. “New River Suite” (some of which appeared in group versions by Eight Point Star on a PBS documentary about Appalachia’s New River) is a keening set of themes that have the memorable melodies of established traditional repertoire but are all completely new. “Wild Geese Chase” is a rugged and wild slash through a well-known fiddle standard. “Halfway From Shawsville” rounds things out with a lovely tribute to Mike’s Virginia town.",

            "about": "Extreme Bukake is the perversely titled follow-up to Simon's 1999 CD Butterfly Dust. In contrast to the live performance-based pieces on BD, Extreme Bukake is a dissection of religious music, realized by Simon on laptop. Traditional components like Catholic hymns and Simon's vocal on a Hare Krsna prayer get fragmented, splintered, and reassembled into a rich blob of sound.\nSimon's notes on the tracks: \"The Self-Immolation of Thich Quang Duc\" is a programmatic work based around the death of this Vietnamese monk who set himself alight to protest about the activity of the Vietnamese government in the early 1960s. He was a friend of Thich Nhat Hanh, whom Martin Luther King Jr nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965. The music sounds like the craziness of the situation, the external noise of cars and people and the internal noise of the heart and the soul of this man. \"Sri Guru Vandana\" is a song from the Hare Krsna (ISKCON) tradition of Krisna Vaisnavitism, a nod in the direction of my pre-Buddhist, teenager self, the young man who got into ISKCON and then freaked out at the evangelical nature of the organization. This is my acknowledgement of the positive side of my experience. \"Ave Regina Celorum\" is based round a Catholic hymn to Mary, an attempt to create a piece which could perhaps be used for meditation, either formal or informal.",

            "about": "Faint at the Loudest Hour is the astonishing solo debut by guitarist Alexander Turnquist, part of a young generation of guitar players who have taken their incredible virtuosity and turned it into something actually worth listening to. Like James Blackshaw, Jack Rose, Glenn Jones, etc, this could roughly be described as \"raga\" guitar, with its long, modal compositions and hypnotic overtone play. Unlike most of his peers, Alex employs a variety of extended techniques ala Hans Reichel, grappling the strings with both hands and using a variety of approaches and attacks on both the steel and wood. There's also a distinct lack of audible \"roots\" influence here, with Alex sidestepping the Fahey-isms that dominate so much current acoustic guitar music. Along with the 6 & 12 string acoustics, Alex makes subtle use of electronic textures, such as the surprising Fennesz-like dissolve that occurs midway through \"amongst a swarm of hummingbirds.\"",

            "about": "More scrambled art/post-rock from the four-eyed trio, recorded simultaneously with Acupuncture (released by kranky). Feng Shui represents a more \"ambient\" and contemplative side of the eclectic trio. The band's use of bowed guitars on several of the tracks gives the record an eerie but mostly serene atmosphere. There's a layered intricacy to the music that belies the fact that most of this is actually a live-to-2 track recording. There are a couple of bombastic moments here, of course. Features the full 30 mins or so of \"Ascending Copper Mountain,\" previously excerpted on the prophetic vhf sampler (Stand Up For Art Rock (Because Space Rock Is Over).",

            "about": "Second in a series of 3 LPs of Library Music miniatures from composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O’Sullivan (Æthenor, Ulver, This is Not This Heat, etc) following 2020’s Electric Māyā. For heads, the term “Library Music” in 2021 might evoke dodgy Italian gray market LPs and crate diggers hunting for “funky breaks” - but London’s venerable KPM Music is working with groundbreakers like Daniel to open up new avenues for composers to experiment. Fourth Density’s 15 tracks include several beguiling instrumental beauties, including the Ashra-like “Astral Survivor” and the drifty “Faster Than Light.” Mixed in with the instrumental are almost-pop gems like the hypnotic “Orgone Attenuation” and “Head In The Belfry,” both with guest vocals from Astrud Steeholder. Like the other volumes, this is in a beautiful jacket designed by Dan and Turner Prize-nominee Mark Titchner and pressed on aesthetically complimentary blue vinyl.\n“Library music. Akasha. Here you accept that music behaves like a thing to accentuate another thing, seemingly unrelated. A beautiful, shining blankness. Not passive. An opportunity to wade. A brief encounter with an open-ended destiny. As in, you never know who or what it will be partnered with. With library music the emphasis tends to be on functionality and less on sonic self-portraiture. So it compels you to be concise, like what is the function of this work? The distance is liberating. It’s less “What Am I? and more “What Is This?”. It compels you to be brief, each little cell is a world of its own in an assemblage of miniatures all vibrating in their collective identity. Then there is the occult nature of library music which is fetishized by many for its ability to induce time travel, often to send us back to some televisual memory. However, despite its broad-brush strokes, the library can be so profoundly alien, especially when experienced independently of the televisual realm; an unruly chimera of genre mutations, compositional curiosities and the deepest wallpaper you ever laid ears on. Perhaps the observances of library music can help unshackle us from our artistic insecurities and delusions, where one is drawn to the shape of music as a whole instrument unto itself; as a vehicle carrying our intention and consisting of everything we have to give at that moment; so things that are seemingly unrelated are ultimately connected.” – Daniel O’Sullivan",

            "about": "Originally a very limited CDR cooked up in commemoration of VHF UK freak scene gigs. 2 tracks from Sunroof!, one is the usual buzz with sort of a Hawkwind vibe (listen carefully and you'll hear the beat), the other a more idealized Richter Band style new-age jammer w/Bower plucking the genteel harmonics (?). Weird. Richard gives us some delicately bowed autoharp and miscellany. VCO kicks it live in Glasgow for quite a few mins. Another winner from the true UK underground.",

            "about": "An unorthodox and lovely bunch of tracks- a theoretical version of some incredible indigenous music from a culture that doesn’t exist. Exotic and beautiful sounds from a variety of instruments both acoustic and electronic. The album's two centerpieces are “Sixteen OO,” a simple melody which spirals into the ether, and “Perranthnoe,” a track with an atmosphere much like a crinkling sheet of cellophane. I have no idea what that means. Surrounding these two are several short tracks, including the immortally titled “Techno Won Ton.” A surprising and charming record suitable for many uses. Richard and Steven also recorded a couple of other CD's worth of material, but aside from the \"St Helena\" 7\" on Insample, this is all that was released.",

            "about": "Cian’s lovely follow up to 2011’s much acclaimed “Doubles” LP/CD (vhf#125) presents two short solo acoustic turns - one original, and one Black Flag cover. “Grass Above My Head” is a wistful fingerpicked south Dublin coastal lovesick blues. In contrast to the two ambitiously complex side-long tracks on Doubles, “Grass” is simple and elegant, full of just-so chord changes that make all the right references to the genre classics. In contrast, the truly unusual assault on Black Flag’s “My War” is a knot of edgy picking, starting with an abstracted take on Greg Ginn’s naggingly dissonant intro and rapidly moving into a hypnotic variant that suggest an entirely different kind of blues than the A-side. Truly one of the weirdest (and best) Flag covers of all time.",

            "about": "27th Anniversary set for the multi-dimensional UK crew, led by Phil Todd and Melanie O'Dubhslaine. Nearly 6 hours of cosmic, psychedelic, mind-boggling sounds, featuring a newly recorded LP plus 4 max-length CDs curated by AshNav connoisseurs Rob Hayler, Henry Rollins, Pete Coward, and Neil Campbell. The CD's are drawn from AshNav's massive back catalog of mostly small run/private releases, covering activity dating back to 1994. Mining a deep well of thousand-yard stare psychedelia, Ashtray Navigations possess of one of the most exciting outre’ music catalogs of the contemporary era, matching the classics from any era in originality and straight-up bonkers fun. This epic release includes a full range of hypnotic jams, including sequencer-led cosmic workouts, drifty ambience, and a heavy dose of Phil Todd’s ripping, laser guitar leads. The gatefold LP also includes pithy liner notes from Matt Valentine, Henry Rollins, Jon Dale, and more.\n“Enter the world of Ashtray Navigations, and things flip over and out pretty quickly. A languorous swoon for tabla and guitar swiftly jolts, by way of a brutish edit, into overamped squall; electronics pile up like rubble around crashing, descending sheets of copper; the four-track leaks bongwater and brown muck, while ferric oxide, chrome dioxide and cobalt fight a losing battle. An echoplex sweats it out in the corner of the room as Todd tears unruly tattoos from a dosed guitar, the amp huffing and heaving in protest. I still can't quite figure out exactly how Todd does what he does, and while I'm aware of some of the reference points, there's both magic and graft in the way he's piecing it all together. But you know what? I'm pretty sure Fritz Pfleumer never had this in mind.” - Jon Dale\n\"Phil. Well I am glad you're finally back from your place in Monaco and getting to work. The pictures of you with the polo mallet and the horses you sent were impressive, sure but when you sell yourself as an artist type and then are seen cavorting with those over tanned Euro trustfunders, it is alienating to your audience. You are, however, the only person I have ever met who has actually cavorted and that's why you will always be a mid-level god to me\" - Henry Rollins",

            "about": "Third VHF album from this young New York-based guitarist/composer who continues to forge his own radical style to create a very resonant and enveloping acoustic sound, full of beautiful harmonic overtone interplay, all instruments sustained. Alex's guitar approach revolves around a prodigious right-hand technique and a minimalist slant on composition that separates him from the retro-styling endemic to most current acoustic guitar music. Hallway of Mirrors uses much of the tonal palate from his previous record (As the Twilight Crane Dreams in Color, vhf#118) - dense 12-string finger-picking with vibraphone and piano carrying much of the melody. On Hallway, the pieces are more concise with the added sweep of Christopher Tignor's elegant violin punctuating Alex's harmonics-laden forward motion and Matthew O'Koren's immaculate vibraphone (played with both mallets and bow). The additional instrumentation, inspired in part by Steve Reich's \"Music for 18 Musicians,\" provides an added focus in the music, signifying each change in tone and timbre. Recorded on analog tape using traditional automatic double tracking stereo mix techniques by engineers Henry Hirsch and Bram Tobey, the sound has an elegant soft focus that highlights Alex's strong and sharp performance. The centerpiece of the album, the 16 minute \"Waiting at the Departure Gate,\" makes a sly nod in tribute to fellow VHF artist Jack Rose, who all too briefly explored similar techniques on his classic \"Black Pearls.\" A truly uplifting and emotional listening experience.",

            "about": "Holy Letters is a barely-circulated masterpiece of deeply felt self-expression. Recorded in 1989/1990 by Hiroyuki Usui, Holy Letters beautifully captures the spirit and substance of a half-dozen of the key sub-underground pillars of sound. Working with guitar, vocals, vibes, harmonium, bass, drums, cello, field recordings, digeridoo, and more, Usui-san blends delicate folk, psychedelia, and experimental sounds into a mostly subdued but undeniably glowing suite. The layered but careful instrumentation on tracks like the epic \"Holy Letters\" and \"Troll\" backs the alternately plain-spoken and crooning vocals perfectly. Odd touches like snatches of throat singing and bowed vibraphone leap out of the mix at just the right time. There are overt references to the blues (the first track is an oblique cover of \"Cold Was The Ground\") - but other than the occassional slide guitar touch, the connection is overwhelmingly in the timeless feeling and atmosphere. I can hardly think of anything else like \"Holy Letters,\" but suffice to say if you like Richard Youngs, Popol Vuh, Six Organs of Admittance, Tim Buckley, acid-folk, japanese underground - anything like that - this is an essential purchase. Really, I'm not doing it justice.\nHoly Letters was self-released by Hiro in 1994, primarily to be given away to friends. A handful of copies were sold via Tokyo's Modern Music/PSF operation in Japan and by Forced Exposure in the US, but other than that, it disappeared completely. Hiroyuki Usui's name pops up in several intriguing places in the apparently still underdocumented Japanese underground lexicon. While he now concentrates mostly on Digieridoo (and his profession of garden design), he once played drums in Fushitsusha (late 70's/early 80's), A-Musik (with the legendary vocalist Phew), Marble Sheep, and several other true-underground outfits.\nThe album includes the entire CD and 7\" from the original package, plus an alternate version of \"Troll\" from the original sessions.The digital booklet including previously unpublished photos and new liner notes by Hiroyuki Usui and Ben Chasny (included in both Japanese and English).",

            "about": "Hypnotape is a crash course for becoming a mutant.\nA genuinely sprawling collection of high-fidelity mutation music that suits the compact disc format perfectly, Hypnotape is the third consecutive Sunburned album of studio assemblages following 2019's Headless and 2021's Pick A Day To Die. Recorded throughout 2021 & 2022, it's an album possessed with a peculiar runaway locomotion which jump cuts feverishly between unusual atmospheres yet maintains a beguiling consistency - throbbing, twisting, undulating rhythmic blast offs suddenly kick the door down into serene realms of nuanced acoustic privacy which are unexpectedly plunged back, face first into a miasma of shirtless, raging thuggery, ad infinitum.\nThe album is notable in the group’s monstrous catalog for a few reasons: first, it showcases founding member Conrad Capistran stepping out from behind the keyboards & electronics to spread his smooth, buttery baritone atop the majority of the tracks. From his velvet cooing above the pulsing whirlwind of opener \"People Person\" to his vivid & febrile musings as a trip reporter on the frontlines of the meltdown zone on \"Roger\" (where Capistran fully embodies the age old tango between euphoria & dread) his honeyed vocals guide the listener Virgil-like through the inferno all the way to the album's finale where he duets with Ron Schneiderman on the old Dino Valenti / Quicksilver chestnut (and potential Boomer epithet, sung by the group's two actual boomers!) \"What About Me\".\nSecondly, it features the recorded debut of Sunburned's longtime friend & collaborator Mark Perretta after years of touring with the group. Some of you may remember Mark from his days stomping across the primordial Boston underground of the late 80's/early 90's with the mighty Subskin Cables or his solo career as Deluxx but most, no doubt, will be familiar with his stint with Lou Barlow, John Davis & Bob Fay as Deluxx Folk Implosion, most notably when Mark's whimsical ode to fatherhood \"Daddy Never Understood\" was used in the opening sequence to Larry Clark's beloved coming of age tale \"Kids\" in 1996.\nFinally, with Hypnotape, Sunburned steps into the hallowed VHF arena after decades of hovering along adjacent corridors. Now the group's penchant for transforming sketchy, Masshole dysphoria into fleeting puddles of enlightenment can ooze comfortably alongside the esteemed discographies of label mates & compatriots like Vibracathedral Orchestra, Astral Social Club, Ashtray Navigations, Pelt et al.

            "about": "The oddly titled If Only For The Hatchery was Wingtip Sloat's first new work in almost 3 years following 1995's Chewyfoot and found the boys fitter and \"better recorded\" than ever. 12 all new tracks and not a single throw-away (well, OK, maybe one but it's only 1 min long). Following on from their legendary early-90's singles, IOFTH finds the trio's blend of highly fragmented rock and cryptic experimentation mercifully unaltered by the comings and goings of recent trends. In the tradition of other over-intellectualizers Wire, Swell Maps, Tall Dwarfs, etc. Sloat mix the familiar and strange in equal parts, adding in unique instrumental and vocal personality. Charming and disarming, IOFTH contains lyrical and melodic tracks like \"Sundowner's 90 Mile Pilot\" alongside angular post-punk chargers like \"Part Of Three\" and makes the whole mess work. Really, this is right up their with their early singles in terms of fragmented art-damage and FUN.",

            "about": "Third LP from Finnish group Mahti, a collaboration between three members of stalwart avant-rock legends Circle and Hannu Saha. Saha plays the Kantele, a traditional Finnish acoustic instrument which can have 5, 10, 15, or 36 strings, and which is plucked like a zither or harp, producing a delicate string sound. Following their two very limited studio LPs on UK label Riot Season, Konsertti I is an excellent recording of the group in live performance, capturing their understated and beautiful mix of ambient, electronic, and string music. Saha’s Kantele centers the music, sometimes plucking out melodic arpeggios, at others blending in with the burbling-but-subtle electronic and electric guitar backdrop. Doesn’t really sound like anything else, but recommended to fans of AR & Machines, Ash Ra Temple, Richter Band, Durutti Column, etc. Double LP mastered by John Golden, and pressed on green vinyl by Smashed Plastic in Chicago. “These ancient musicians played their ‘mahti’…and the sound they produced was called ‘musiikki’”",

            "about": "Limited edition 45 RPM 12” of Alex Turnquist’s not-like-anyone-else guitar stylings, with 5 tracks using only plucked harmonics on his 12 string guitar. Using this limited palate of sounds, Turnquist crafts sparkling waves of notes, employing the minimalist sensibilities that have informed his more recent work (e.g. his 2011 VHF LP/CD release Hallway of Mirrors) on a smaller scale. The harmonics here are frequently struck hard and in complex patterns - this is arguably “new age” but not drifty-ambient, more Reich and Riley than Windham Hill. Sunburned Snowflakes is another intriguing experiment from one of the most forward thinking solo players out there, whose recordings are completely devoid of the Folk/Americana spirit so imbued in the genre.\n“My fascination with harmonics on an acoustic guitar started as a child, from before I ever started playing I was drawn towards the warm sounds that I heard people play in brief moments. So I've had the idea for a very long time, that idea being to make an entire solo guitar recording just employing my left hand to the harmonics up and down the neck and alternating picking patterns with the right. I feel like it gives the instrument a tonal color that doesn't necessarily feel at first listen like a 12 string acoustic guitar” – Alex Turnquist",

Group leader Hwan is an under-documented alto player from Korea who has recorded for Japanese Victor and DIW, played at Moers, toured Japan a few times, and collaborated with Gerry Hemingway and Otomo Yoshihide, among others. Active since the 70's, Hwan's discography also includes several CD's of solo alto improvisations and a duo CD with Tuvan vocalist Sainkho Namtchylak. More recently he has been collaborating with Alfred Harth during Harth's residency in Seoul. Percussionist Yoshimitsu is well-traveled in both improv and rock circles, having been a member of Omoide Hatoba and a frequent collaborator with heavyweights like Otomo Yoshide and Haco. The inescapable Makoto Kawabata is best known for his Deep Purple-style rock as a member of Acid Mothers Temple, but on his own he has produced a string of subtle, elegiac solo CD's, performing on guitar, organ, electronics, etc.\nMore minimalist than free jazz, Love Time centers on Hwan's long circular tones, avoiding common free-alto styles in favor of a roughly-hewn clarion approach. Kawabata and Yoshimitsu shadow Hwan subtly on sarangi and bowed percussion. The music gradually builds to a crescendo, with Kawabata switching to guitar and Yoshimitsu moving to the drum kit. An atmospheric and understated work.",

            "about": "Ourselves was originally recorded as a one-hour special for broadcast on London's Resonance FM but was too good to leave to the aether. Ourselves is the first collaboration between Richard and octopus-armed percussionist Neilson. The music here represents something of a return to the extended psychedelic mania of mid 90-s R!!! outings such as Asthma and Diabetes and Endekeg. \"Beam\" kicks off the album with Richard ripping it up on electric guitar over a thick blanket of hand percussion, plucked strings, backwards scraping noises, etc. The 36 minute \"Mexico\" follows with more string mangling, segueing into an atmospheric interlude for voices, bowed cymbals, bells, etc. The final track is an unusual rendering of the traditional \"God Bless The Master,\" with Richard's unmistakeable voice carrying the original melody over the cloud of bric-a-brac and swells of electricity swirling in the background.",

            "about": "Follow-up to 2003's Ourselves by this Glasgow duo finds them extending the already broad range of sound heard on that stunner into new worlds. The two prolific players heard here are at the top of their game, pairing some immediately identifiable elements - Neilson's superb jazz-influenced drumming, Youngs unmistakeable voice - with a thick layer of truly psychedelic clamor. The brief \"Chamber\" rips out a noise like a 60's Ra/Patrick duo, segueing into the also Ra-ish masterpiece \"Music of the Lost Sun.\" The point in \"Lost Sun\" where Young's voice and guitar emerge from the polygot sound for a beautiful melodic interlude is just too much. The second half of the record has a less layered feel, beginning with the acapella \"Noatak Beacon,\" then moving into more aggro territory with Neilson's bowed cymbals taking on Youngs' guitar on \"Mountain.\" The short cut-up \"Big Aeroplanes\" ends the record on a final note of mystery.",

            "about": "Debut collaboration between these like-minded English underground titans, perfectly mixing the long-form pop eccentricities of Grumbling Fur with the free electric sound of Astral Social Club to produce four epic and memorable tracks. The music is dense and layered, with hidden hooks, haunting vocals, unidentifiable electronic shuddering, delicate ambience, etc. Challenging but completely accessible and beautiful stuff. After a brief vocal declaration of purpose, “Back to the Egg” rides a motorik pulse ala Harmonia or Kraftwerk for 10 hypnotic minutes. “Three Years Apart” pulses gently in a burbling cloud, reminding that along with crafting song gems, Grumbling Fur has collaborated with noted avant-composer/performer Charlemagne Palestine. “Ozone Antifreeze Intelligence” layers electronics over a haunting piano and vocal melody, framed by subliminal fuzz guitar. “Toejam Boxdrum” closes the album with an uproarious polyrhythm hidden by more layers of soft-focus electro-fizz, gradually giving way to thick bass riffs and tremelo’d interjections.",

            "about": "VHF debut and second widely-available LP by Liam, part of a new generation of underground “American primitive” guitar players serving the traditions and smashing them up simultaneously. Prodigal Son is a portrait of an artist on the road, changing fast, recording things as they spring from the fountain. The sound here is raw – grass and dirt instead of pre-fab; homemade/handmade instead of high-tech, etc. There’s a visceral quality and immediacy of culture that’s being lost every day in modern life – Prodigal Son is a chance to grab some of it back. “Palmyra” has Liam on weissenborn-style lap steel, the sound fuzzed out and distorted by the guerilla recording technique. “Salmon Tails Up The River” stretches out to nearly 13 minutes, a dense meditation on 12 string that sustains a dark and heavy mood for the entire duration. On the B side, “Insult to Injury” reverses the mood, with an elegant and unhurried 12 string sequel of deep beauty. Liam’s unexpected take on Loren Conners’ “A Moment at the Door” is a perfect translation of Loren’s reverb-heavy electric drift to unadorned acoustic (and tape hiss) – a frozen moment of absolute grace. Wrapping things up is a take on “Old Country Rock,” with fiddle and banjo, just a brief taste of the barnstorming old-time sound of Liam’s touring trio.\n**********************\n“The Prodigal Son returns!! Good lovin’ Lord! Where’s he been? He’s been out in the wilderness (ie The Road). The months, days, and hours spent traversing the endless highways of North America and Europe building up the calluses, muscle memory and psychic energy are now about to pay off. Liam Grant returns with a new LP of acoustic guitar playing on VHF Records, a follow up to his 2023 vinyl full length LP ‘Amoskeag’ on Carbon/Feeding Tube. On ‘Prodigal Son’ Liam expands and mutates his guitar playing to thrilling results. This is raw and real.\nA quick synopsis of the LP tracks :\nPalmyra: A down and dirty blowout boogie that would not feel out of place on an Xpressway cassette from a parallel universe.\nSalmon Tails Up The River: Epic and mesmerizing. Encapsulates the journey of life, death and possibly beyond. Serene streams and raging rough waters. A thousand micro-dramas play out on the fretboard.\nInsult To Injury: Deep meditative travels thru mountains, valleys and fog covered locales that lead to shimmering vistas that are visible to the mind's eye.\nA Moment At The Door: A reworking of a Loren Conners song. Ghosts speak to us through faded photographs and through the needle vibrations on old phonographs.\nOld Country Rock: The fire blazes and the instruments swell to a back yard throw down. Crack a cold one and do the full bottle throttle. This LP goes out with a bang!\nLiam Grant saw fit to document his studies of the wilderness straight to tape with no overdubs and now we can all enjoy some time with the results together. The Prodigal Son is cause for celebration. Just know you can’t keep a travelling man in one place for too long.”\n– John T. Schoen, 2024",

            "about": "Delicate and beautiful music from the combined forces of the recently ubiquitous East-Coast psychedelic combo Elkhorn and Pelt’s Mike Gangloff, laying down two epic raga-like performances captured on a 2022 collaborative tour. Gangloff - fresh from the triumph of his VHF solo fiddle LP “Evening Measures” - has found a distinct instrumental voice, blending drone music and trad influences in a way that really advances the tradition into new areas. “East Dauphin Suite” builds patiently on the interlocking acoustic guitars of the Elkhorn duo, with Gangloff’s hardanger fiddle carrying the melody over the top. The sound is a neat riff on American primitive, with just enough Appalachian-style touches via Gangloff’s careful glissandos cutting through the Vuh-type chords and patterns to create a unique and supremely melodic hybrid. “Summerfield Raga” takes things further out, with more microtonal variation in the embroidery, with assertive bowing and an increased energy level. Pressed in Chicago and housed in an amazing jacket by Jake Blanchard.",

            "about": "A sister record to the \"The Allegory Of Hearing\" (on Drunken Fish), Silver Wheel has 7 complimentary instrumental tracks, made mostly with Roy's trusty 4 track and Tiesco 6 string. A couple of tracks are dominated by his Farfisa organ, which provides a gliding drone and waver on which to hang titles like \"for the disoriented\" and \"for the mortified.\" The longest track here is the \"for a small blue orb,\" a simple strum that builds into a hypnotic pattern over 16 minutes.\n\"The album is dedicated to Geoff Davies and Annie Leadbetter and their son Jess, who, without seeming to worry what they were in for, welcomed me into their house and their lives at 12 Buckingham Ave, Liverpool in 1982. The longest track on this recording was first sketched out in their front room on a black Korean acoustic guitar which I christened \"Rosebud\". It has taken way too long to finish the sketch and to say thanks, but you really did feed my soul and I am grateful for it.\"",

            "about": "Solo darkness from remarkably pedigreed but rarely recorded Japanese legend (Ghost, Fushitsusha, L, Marble Sheep, A-Musik, August Born, etc). Raw and gripping, like a darker version of his all-time folk-psych classic Holy Letters (vhf#84). Performed completely solo on voice, guitar, banjo, bass, steel guitar, and cornet, the music is almost uncomfortably blunt and rough around the edges – a “Tonight’s the Night”-like offhandedness that only serves to increase the feeling of existential seriousness. Like Holy Letters, most of these tracks are undeniably “blues,” but there’s nary a familiar blues progression or guitar phrase. Vocals are a whisper, accompanied by simple guitar or banjo. Clever overdubs add to a few of the tracks – untutored (but just right) blats of cornet here, some electronic static there. If you like Loren Connors, Simon Finn, Jandek, Kan Mikami, Six Organs, etc, this is for you.",

            "about": "Third VHF dispatch from the mighty and prolific Ashtray Navigations, following 2020’s mega and extremely popular Imaginary Greatest Hits package. The curiously titled The Apotheosis of VaVaVoom is one of Phil Todd & Melanie O’Dubhshlaine’s most direct and rocking packages, with mucho ripping lead guitar action backed by some absolutely fun bubbling synth and drum grooves. “Irons Three/The Apotheosis of VaVaVoom” kicks off with wicked wah’d out leads, followed by the subdued ambience of “Tasteful Grey Putting” and “Appropros Tower” and a segue into the driving “Hinges on the Clapometer.” Side 2’s opening combo of “Slush Puppy Window” and “Avatar Down The Highway” sounds like a head on collision between Terje Rypdal and Tangerine Dream on a dark bender, with laser guitar over a bed of tumbling electronics and tiny noises. The closing “Crack Another Bloodcapsule” is one of Ashtray Nav’s all time best, like a lost krautrock classic jam with a driving rhythm from guest drummer Alex Neilson and Sax from Valerio Cosi.",

            "about": "The untitled double CD by San Francisco's Double U draws on a long tradition of west-coast inventiveness and eccentricity. Cutting against all the possible \"hip\" grains of today's underground scene (tm), the Double U go for clarity where others obscure, careful arrangement over aimless jams, and add a \"demix\" disc by their friends Glands Of External Secretion that is completely devoid of breakbeats. If that's not going against the times, then what is? The Double U 's core lineup of guitar, bass, drums, and voice is augmented by tastefully arranged and applied tuba, harmonium, organ and throat singing. The tracks vary from the anthemic \"March To Valhalla\" and the prog-ish \"Cuisine Of Northern India\" to \"Bow Legged Horse\" with its almost touching melody and male/female harmony vocal. As an extra treat you also get the group's unusual arrangment of Ornette Coleman's \"Lonely Woman.\" Recorded on 24 tracks by Gibbs Chapman, this beautiful recording was financed by wealthy (and quite honestly, deluded) Englishman C.P. Pratt. Thanks! The companion demix disc by the Glands Of External Secretion takes the same tracks in the same order and completely turns them inside out. Rather than relying on endless techno beats and easy listening samples, G.O.E.S. rearranges the essential elements of the tracks to render them entirely anew. Parts that were background become hooks, vocals are reexamined up close, melody is replaced by texture and vice-versa.",

            "about": "Much anticipated second full length by the long running duo of Mick Flower (Vibracathedral Orchestra, Sunroof, Michael Flower Band) and Chris Corsano (Flaherty/Corsano, Jandek, Bjork, Sunburned). In the couple of years since their debut \"The Radiant Mirror\" (Textile), the duo has toured and recorded frequently, expanding their range to include a mind-boggling array of free sound. \"I, Brute Force\" kicks off the record with their signature - one of the most original sounds in rock/free/whatever music - the electrifying sound of Flower's virtuosic, heavily amplified Japan Banjo (also known as a Shaahi Baaja) over Corsano's free-wheeling percussion. There's really nothing else like it. Other tracks show off subtle improv moves, with both players using extended techniques to generate a wide range of unusual sounds. Corsano's technical mastery is almost without peer in his generation (Alex Neilson, maybe) - his ability to take the lessons of nearly 5 decades of free playing and extend them into new ranges is startling and exciting. Rather than play backup, Chris meets Mick's strings and organ head-on with his own drum-bowing, cello, and circular breathing-fired melodica.",

            "about": "The world’s best and only Drums/Japan Banjo duo return to VHF for their first LP since 2009’s monumental The Four Aims. Mick Flower (Vibracathedral Orchestra) and Chris Corsano (frequently seen with Bill Orcutt, Joe McPhee, and other luminaries) work an area that’s not really jazz, not really anything – a stream of endlessly mutating free sound, a unique mind-merge between Corsano’s nimble drums and percussion and Flower’s amplified Japan Banjo (also known as a Shahi Baaja, a type of electric Indian zither with both fretted/keyed and drone strings). Flower cuts a highly original line, playing neither “leads” nor making drone-music. Less amplified here than on the more “heavy” The Four Aims, the strings ring out with distinct clarity in short snippets of melody and a canvas of pleasing electric sound. Corsano’s bag is to charm out a flow of thoughtful percussion engagement, rolling around on his kit, continually varying his attack and approach in conversational free-jazz style. The Halcyon is a precious addition to a tiny discography, a fortunate event even in today’s world of small press overabundance. Thanks guys!",

            "about": "Fourth volume of Library Music miniatures by Daniel O’Sullivan (Ulver, Æthenor, This is Not This Heat, etc) for VHF, this time commissioned by the legendary German Music Library, Sonoton. Another sampling of Dan’s versatility and brilliance as a composer, performer, and sound designer, the focus on The Pastoral Machine is more “electronic” compared to the three previous albums Dan recorded for KPM (also issued on LP by VHF), with simpler arrangements and a focus on gentle and emotive synthesised soundworlds. Even without as many full ensemble arrangements, there’s still a wealth of diversity – ‘Empathogen’ opens the record with latticed arpeggiating sequences recalling Japanese “environmental music” or Persian Surgery-era Terry Riley, ‘Fruit of Stream Entry’ burbles with gentle ripples evoking the LP’s title, while ‘The Silversmith of Space’ mines a simple chord sequence evoking Eno’s 70’s classic short instrumentals. ‘Superstrings’ is a series of hypnotic overlapping guitar patterns, like a lost Ash Ra or Achim Reichel track. The brief ‘Star Lore’ is a heavy highlight with deep bass washes and grainy, tape-laminated melodies, followed immediately by Rose Keeler Schaffeler’s vocal feature on ‘The Oscillating Love’ recalling futurist new-age pop in the vein of Enya or Virginia Astley. Housed in a jacket and heavy euro-style inner featuring collages by Daniel, soon to be the subject of an art book published by Timeless Editions in mid-2024.",

            "about": "Third in a trilogy of LPs of Library Music miniatures from composer and multi-instrumentalist Daniel O’Sullivan (Æthenor, Ulver, This is Not This Heat, etc) following 2020’s Electric Māyā and 2021’s Fourth Density. For heads, the term “Library Music” in 2021 might evoke dodgy Italian gray market LPs and crate diggers hunting for “funky breaks” - but London’s venerable KPM Music is working with groundbreakers like Daniel to open up new avenues for composers to experiment. The 15 tracks on “The Physic Garden” are fully-formed and orchestrated compositions, which would be highlights on anyone’s LP, never mind as incidental music. Of the music, Dan says: “The Physic Garden is an album of diverse instrumentals inspired by a swathe of verdant vistas from manicured gardens and follies to urban common land, overgrown and forgotten. Convalescent memories in the shape of psychedelic auditory botanics.”\nKey tracks include the droning acoustic folk of the title song; the Canterbury-esque rolling horn and woodwind melody of “Return the Heart” (with expert drum kit from Frank Byng); The prog-ish odd meter interlude “Buttercup Tea”; The quiet ambience and delicate melody of “Dusty Feather:”; and the Eno-like drift of “Vapourer Larvae.”\n“Library music. Akasha. Here you accept that music behaves like a thing to accentuate another thing, seemingly unrelated. A beautiful, shining blankness. Not passive. An opportunity to wade. A brief encounter with an open-ended destiny. As in, you never know who or what it will be partnered with. With library music the emphasis tends to be on functionality and less on sonic self-portraiture. So it compels you to be concise, like what is the function of this work? The distance is liberating. It’s less “What Am I? and more “What Is This?”. It compels you to be brief, each little cell is a world of its own in an assemblage of miniatures all vibrating in their collective identity. Then there is the occult nature of library music which is fetishized by many for its ability to induce time travel, often to send us back to some televisual memory. However, despite its broad-brush strokes, the library can be so profoundly alien, especially when experienced independently of the televisual realm; an unruly chimera of genre mutations, compositional curiosities and the deepest wallpaper you ever laid ears on. Perhaps the observances of library music can help unshackle us from our artistic insecurities and delusions, where one is drawn to the shape of music as a whole instrument unto itself; as a vehicle carrying our intention and consisting of everything we have to give at that moment; so things that are seemingly unrelated are ultimately connected.” – Daniel O’Sullivan",

            "about": "Debut standalone VHF LP by the Elkhorn duo of Drew Gardner and Jesse Sheppard, a tight set of six studio recordings in a variety of moods and featuring a lot of new sound textures. Elkhorn’s prolific stream of releases since 2016 has highlighted their mastery of sprawling long-form, acoustic-driven hypno-jams, with an emphasis on live performance (including on their collaboration with Pelt’s Mike Gangloff on the Shackamaxon Concert LP). The Red Valley is a more layered and composed-sounding set, with the duo overdubbing extensively on top of their own dual guitars. Leading off the LP, “Crystal Hummingbird” features one of their signature minor-modal vamps, with layers of fuzz bass, zither, and frame drum providing weight and psychedelic density. “Gray Salt Trail” continues the vibe, with thick fuzz vibraphone supplementing the cinematic palate, leading into the spare side-closer “Black Wind of Kayenta, where Sheppard plays electric 12-string and Gardner solos on acoustic guitar.\nSide two starts with “Road to Chaco Canyon,” a brooding duet that builds momentum with Gardner’s insistent frame drum cadence, dropping down into the quiet string pool of “Inside Spider Rock” (featuring Fern Knight’s Jesse Sparhawk on gloriously swirling lever harp) and the graceful finale “Jackrabbit Hops.” Pressed in Chicago by Smashed Plastic, first edition on pink vinyl. Striking jacket designed by Rob Carmichael/SEEN Studios!",

            "about": "Debut LP release by The Slowest Lift (Sophie Cooper and Julian Bradley), presenting a new chapter in the long-running tradition of radical English music duos. Originally formed via a commission from the Supernormal Festival, Cooper (an accomplished solo performer and collaborator) and Bradley (from frequent VHF delinquents Vibracathedral Orchestra) play a kind of gentle post-industrial psychedelia, with Cooper’s lovely vocals floating over a collage of live and electronic performance. The songs are a blend of straightforward performance and eccentric bricolage, with rude electronic interjections sitting comfortably alongside delicate guitar and keyboard melodies. Zoviet France-like low-fi atmospherics compete with Cooper’s voice for air on tracks like “Crystal Fracture“ and “Hi From the Skyline Swim,“ while the duo’s surprising cover of Duran Duran’s “The Chauffeur” deep on side 2 sneaks in perfectly, a mini pop music drama reimagined as pure hallucination.",

            "about": "This was greeted with complete mystification when released, being decidedly non-riffy. More than 20 years on from release, it seems a logical step in the flow of UK underground output that spawned Sunroof!, Vibracathedral, Jazzfinger, et al. It's a good deal less intense than recent Hototogisu and SF output that's had all dials set to \"annihilate.\" The music here is an authoritative re-working of some of the ideas that first surfaced on their Argon CD (released by Freek). The modal structures and experiments with bowed instruments and horns that surfaced on that record are redefined and sharpened in terms of sound quality and execution, providing an extremely fulfilling listen for both the SF acclimated and the novice alike. The 40 minute \"The Pirate Ship Of Reality Is Moving Out\" was recorded live to DAT at a concert with Richard Youngs on extra guitar, and is the only vintage SF live recording of such high fidelity.",

            "about": "Debut LP by the duo of Gangloff and Joynes, finding novel ways to combine their accomplished takes on avant folk, American primitive, and outsider sound into a unique and beautiful jumble. Side A’s “Rapid City” is a brisk fingerpicked jaunt featuring Joynes’ unique acoustic/electric hybrid sound, followed by “West Cavalier” where Gangloff’s sawing fiddle and Joynes’ guitar take on a straight mountain-style tune. “Two Bishops” is a languorous and atmospheric Joynes’ guitar feature that slips into an extended minor key fingerpicked tremolo. Gangloff’s “The Other Side of Catawba” is a solo fiddle staple from his recent repertoire (and heard on his VHF LP “Evening Measures”), rendered here in a haunting, reverberant version. The old-time staple “Sail Away Ladies” closes the side at a tempo made for a country store dance. Side B takes a more expansive and outré attitude, with Joynes’ nimble “An Opening” (and the brief noise interlude “Eight Sets of Inverted Commas”) setting up the lengthy “Witch Marks,” which closes proceedings with a dark and droning vibe.",

            "about": "Finland has long had a uniquely progressive underground, with thriving punk, avant, jazz, and rock scenes with oversized output and impact. Jussi Lehtisalo’s (Circle, Pharaoh Overlord, Mahti, etc) label Ektro has been at the center of this activity for the last 3 decades, with a stream of excellent and conceptually bonkers releases covering music of all types. Here Jussi joins up with Jan Anderzén (of Kemialliset Ystävät among others) for an LP of absolutely fun and unusual miniature duets that sound like alien Library music beamed in from the outerlands. Tracks like “Luukku Yksi” and “Puistossa” use a charmingly retro synth-y sound palate and Cluster-like melodic sensibility to make accessible some deceptively “out” music. Some cuts (like “Kylpy”) have a vague hint of early 80’s post-punk/new wave vibes, bouncing along in a friendly way with odd interjections of sample debris and electronics jumping out of the mix to keep it weird. The surging “Hymy yössä” could be music for the credits of the world’s hippest newscast. Beautiful jacket by renown Helsinki-based artist dylan ray arnold, bringing the die-cut techniques of their gallery pieces like “Growth of the Night Plants” to LP form.",

            "about": "Debut LP by the New Zealand duo of Bruce Russell (Dead C, Handful of Dust, etc) and Luke Wood. Visceral Realists is a high-concept commentary on the state of vinyl, analogue recording, music culture, art, etc. A 45-rpm bullet of short bursts of free electric sound, the music here is tactile and rough but not “noise music.” Russell and Wood play over loops of scratchy records, with their guitars and electronics surging to get over the wall. Russell’s guitar sound from his vintage transistor amp and anti-style is instantly recognizable from countless classic Dead C sides, but the tracks are more painterly than recent DC epics – these are celebratory vignettes of thoughts – singles, if you will. Originally made as an unfindable edition of 20 by Wood’s Ilam Press label to accompany an exhibit of NZ lathe-cut records, this new edition is beautifully packaged in a debossed and letterpress printed sleeve designed by Wood and printed by Stumptown in Portland. Two color risographs printed by Wood in NZ are tipped onto the jacket, and an additional two inserts provide revelatory notes by Russell and glam shots of the instruments that made the sounds. Also includes download slip.\n“There’s more information encoded in an old record than in a new one. Every crack, every pop, a tree ring of recovered time. A life-time. Time again for life. Like the revenants, come from the grave warm; and once again walking. But still just blood in a bag. The glow of the vacuum at the heart of a market-place – where art goes to fetch bread. That is how we’ve warmed our hands for this work. To know we are alive” – Bruce Russell",

            "about": "Volume 3 of a set of collaborations between the prolific Argentine polymaths Reynols and the inescapable Acid Mothers Temple. Recorded in Buenos Aries on AMT’s 2017 South American Tour, the music has identifiable sonic elements from both groups but ends up sounding like neither, with a surprising weightlessness that keeps things jammy and psychedelic until the final track’s blustering rock. Taking up most of side 1, “Kicking Air Bricks” has a loose Gong/70’s Euro-classic vibe, with Satoshima Nani getting to swing on the drums in a way that isn’t always part of AMT’s steamroller, while the rest of the gang layers in abstract piano, percussion, glissando guitar, etc. “Multiverse Turtle Reflex” closes the side with a thick drone coda. Side 2 starts with Miguel Tomasin’s gentle vocal and organ accompaniment on “Smelling Oneiric Asado” before the group gradually gathers momentum with Wolf’s thick bass anchoring layers of clean & loose guitar interplay. “Lemurian Tsunami Inside A Hat” is a 13 minute heavy rock epic, with the Reynols’ guitars going head to head with Kawabata’s easily recognized interjections, ramping up into a riffy crescendo.",

            "about": "Limited edition full-length album produced to commemorate first ever US Tour by this wing of the VHF family. Sunroof's 8 tracks are a mix of archetypical Sunroof! drone and shimmer and wild/jarring sampler-analog-bloop driven action. Confusing, to say the least. VCO weigh in with an eclectic mix, including the delicate \"Let A Thousand Flowers Bloom,\" a clip from a gig at the Royal Festival Hall, and most importantly, Bridget Hayden blowing up a storm on the flute.",

            "about": "2000 album by the classic VCO quintet of Neil Campbell, Bridget Hayden, Julian Bradley, Michael Flower, and Adam Davenport. Assembled from recordings of their weekly sessions in Michael's kitchen, the tracks here represent the joyous, celebratory side of the VCO - all forward motion, massed strings, percussion, horns, and little instruments rocketing forward in a swirl of sound. Compared to the more austere sounds of recent CD's like \"Lino Hi\" and \"Versatile Arab Chord Chart,\" the tracks here take off from where the loose hippy chant and drum action of collectives like Amon Duul intersects with the ploygot instrumental approach of mid-60's Sun Ra (ref \"Exotic Forest,\" \"Shadow World,\" etc). \"There is no chord formation that can be planned which creates elation or sadness, or any art which is profound enough to change anything fundamental about a person. There is just a resonance around us which musicians/artists are using or not using\" - Bridget Hayden on the VCO.",

            "about": "First in a trio of limited edition new LP's from the ever mysterious Vibracathedral crew, returning from another relatively quiet period with an uncompromising set of outre' jams. Slightly reorganized around a lineup of stalwarts Mick Flower and Adam Davenport with frequent collaborators John Godbert (Total) and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man), the band here stretches way, way out over these six sides, taking in several different styles while maintaining \"that\" sound all the way through. Joka Baya offers up a first side of short pieces, in a high-fidelity style that is in direct contrast to the dark, smoky sound of the rest of the tracks. The percussive grooves laid down by all 4 members are overlaid with Sunroof-like shimmer, stabbing electric leads, gentle acoustic rain, and droning organ peeking through at opportune moments. The roaring side-long epic on the flip is a droning, phasing slice of psychedelia with Moloney's drums battering the tape in between long stretches of humming stasis.",

            "about": "Triple album celebrating the Fall 2003 US tour by the UK team. The groop (Hayden, Davenport, Greenwood, Bradley, and Flower) tore it up in various shady east coast venues and now after much collating we're finally able to present the audio post-mortem. The tracks range from the atmospheric (Fredericksburg) to the raucous (Philadelphia), covering the full range of VCO styles. Bower and Godbert pitch in on some tracks.\nLiner Notes by Tom Greenwood:\n...i've been busy this past past year, touring a bunch with my own band, and when you're far away from anything you recognize, and someone reaches out a hand...or a big 'ol oven mitt, in the case of neil campbell...even if it's just a support spot on a gig, or a floor to sleep on, when kindness is offered, and the joy of music is shared, it means a lot. and when we met up with vco in the uk, their music and friendship made the dreary island a shimmering oasis for a couple of nights in leeds and manchester, and their music made a waterproof impression that i will never forget. when i realized that they had never before played in the states, i put out a line or two, in hopes that we could arrange to get themover here...the next thing i knew, i was picking them up at the airport. the following two weeks i spent driving them up and down the east coast, they figured i was helping them out, and i was, i guess....we made all the concerts, plus had a couple of amazing recording sessions in woodstock, ny and baltimore. we didn't make nearly enough money to cover expenses, but they left with a small pile of cash...what they\ndidn't figure on was how much they helped me. by being of service to the fine humans of vco and sunroof!, by helping them with meals, and music, they gave me a piece of the joy they shared in an adventure\nof everyday life. thanks! peace. -tom greenwood, hudson ny",

            "about": "Return of the mighty “classic” lineup of the VCO with their first new music in many years. Here the quintet of Michael Flower, Neil Campbell, Bridget Hayden, Adam Davenport, and Julian Bradley (joined by raconteur John Godbert) feature in a set of upbeat tracks that put the group's radical instrumental strategies into a package of full on rock action. Recorded live using a binaural head system, the sound is nicely ragged in a you-are-there way, with scouring guitars and bleeping electronics riding atop the band’s signature grooves. As with some of the band’s other records, there’s more than a hint of the early Velvet Underground spirit here – if you wish that Cale and Reed would have been more into being an instrumental band, here it is. Includes download code.\nA BINAURAL RECORDING",

            "about": "Third in a trio of limited edition new LP's from the ever mysterious Vibracathedral crew, returning from another relatively quiet period with an uncompromising set of outre' jams. Slightly reorganized around a lineup of stalwarts Mick Flower and Adam Davenport with frequent collaborators John Godbert (Total) and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man), the band here stretches way, way out over these six sides, taking in several different styles while maintaining \"that\" sound all the way through. Smoke Song's more gentle exposition starts with Davenport's santoor (a type of hammered dulcimer) leading the band into a lengthy mid-tempo groove on \"Smoke Song,\" followed on the second half of the side by the short, quiet \"Cholita Maria.\" The second side's 17 minute \"Get it, got it\" lays down the tremolo and phase in a probably unintentional echo of the best Spacemen 3 comedowns, taking a pulse and riding it into an organ and percussion fueled bliss.",

            "about": "Eagerly anticipated overground release from this busy quintet of troublemakers is an immense visceral slab of rackety action. While certainly their most upbeat and percussive music ever, the 9 tracks run through a wide range of styles. \"The Slient Socket\" has a gamelan-like 5 note melody overlaid with a hovering drone. \"Magnetic Burn\" is the band at its most rock, with sister-ray style guitar careening along side actual drums (!). The two 20 minute epics that bookend the record are a study in contrasts: \"Ramshackle Sunrise\" has the heavy and excited buzz of the groop's frequent and unpredictable live shows, while the closing \"Goodnight Stars Goodnight Air\" is a gentler acoustic epilogue, gliding into the rosy future.",

            "about": "Second in a trio of limited edition new LP's from the ever mysterious Vibracathedral crew, returning from another relatively quiet period with an uncompromising set of outre' jams. Slightly reorganized around a lineup of stalwarts Mick Flower and Adam Davenport with frequent collaborators John Godbert (Total) and John Moloney (Sunburned Hand of the Man), the band here stretches way, way out over these six sides, taking in several different styles while maintaining \"that\" sound all the way through. The Secret Base starts up at full throttle, straight into the middle of a raw sounding live outing, Flower's overdriven guitar occupying the same sonic space that gives his signature japan banjo/shaahi baaja workouts with Chris Corsano their urgency. The sound is dark and rough, almost Xpressway-like in its claustrophobic atmosphere. The percolating Krautrock stylings of \"If you can't smoke 'em, sell 'em\" chugs along hypnotically for over 13 minutes to close out the side. On side 2, the entire 20+ minutes are devoted to the clanging free sound of \"Eyes of Wood,\" where gamelan-like metal percussion dominates the proceedings.",

            "about": "Versatile Arab Chord Chart is the second full-length outing by the quintet of Neil Campbell, Michael Flower, Julian Bradley, Bridget Hayden and Adam Davenport. Like their UK cousins and fellow VHF recording artists Sunroof!, Vibracathedral Orchestra usually works from a base of modal improvisation. Led by Campbell's sawing violin, tracks like \"Wearing Quid Frock\" and the epic \"Japan Banjo\" build up arcs of lingering overtones beneath an undercurrent of melody. They cut the drones in their life with extremely effective bursts of near rock, in a style reminiscent of the pre-Nico Velvet Underground (circa 1966 or so). The band's combination of clattering percussion, droning strings, and considerable sense of where to put the \"groove\" on tracks like \"Catching Loners With Blank Arms\" makes them unique among their peers. Versatile Arab Chord Chart follows the band's previous Lino Hi outing on Giardia and a series of intriguing and extremely limited self-released titles.",

            "about": "Public service reissue of this impossibly rare and choice title in the Vibra oeuvre, originally issued by the band in 2004 as an edition of 250. Featuring the “classic” lineup (Mick Flower, Neil Campbell, Bridget Hayden, Adam Davenport, Julian Bradley) that made “Queen of Guess” (vhf#77) and “Dabbling With Gravity and Who You Are” (vhf#66), this self-titled double takes a wild ride through the inner-workings of VCO’s stream of consciousness.\nMany of the tracks (selected from research & development jams) here cut in abruptly, continuing the informal, expansive vibe of the band’s other self-released items. The thick blanket of signature drone-fog is never far away, anchoring the tunes which veer from early Velvets-style rock jammers (“Thrift”) to swirling electronic mystery (“Clear”). On side 3, “Gist” builds up a looping, guitar-led rhythm like a lost A.R. & Machines track, sharing the same side with the pulsing “Flötz,” which rides a taut electro-pulse bolstered by group small percussion. This lengthy double concludes with the almost side-long “Minkey,” featuring the full complement of VCO sound signatures in one big hallucinatory swirl.",

            "about": "The 7 tracks on Wisdom are thee VCO's most rocking dispatch ever, neatly combining the Ra-like collage of tracks like \"Wisdom Thunderbolt\" with the insistent jams of the pulsing \"A Natural Fact\" and \"Order of the Broad Eraser.\" \"Ochre Dust\" and \"Rainbow Whirlwind\" are more in the old-school VCO thick-blanket of sound, with an insistent tuned-percussion melody peeking out from the fog. After a surprise opening, \"Sway-Sage\" heaves with raucous drumming (courtesy of Magik Marker Pete Nolan) under the swells of sound. Hard to imagine, but this is the first widely-available (except for the compilation \"Tuning to the Rooster\") music from the VCO since 2003's \"The Queen of Guess.\" Music by Mick Flower, Bridget Hayden, Neil Campbell, and Adam Davenport. Guest appearances by Chris Corsano, Pete Nolan, John Godbert, and Matthew Bower. Cover art by HEXIT,",
