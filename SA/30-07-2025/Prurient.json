            "about": "The skylines of Tokyo and New York City are impenetrable. On the streets it is cold - the ravens have blocked out the sun. The barbed chicken wire that surrounds the cities wave scraps of plastic shreds of circuit boards like surrender flags. Ravens have become the society, they are now the rulers.\nBlack Crows Cyborg is the first collaboration from noise titans Merzbow and Prurient. With more than seven hundred releases between them, this LP finds new ways to traverse the empty cities and navigate the cylinders. These two side-length tracks of cryptic dissonance are underscored by the slightest hint of deconstructed computer synthesis and cyborg vocals.\nRavens remember actions from specific humans, and can warn them of impending danger - or choose not to. As the conspiracy of crows overwhelms mankind's encampment and integrates with the industrial leftovers, Black Crows Cyborg is the soundtrack for the overwhelming embrace under dark mechanical wings.",

            "about": "Known as America’s most prominent noise figurehead, for nearly 20 years under the moniker of PRURIENT, Dominick Fernow has created a sonic entity unlike any other in the realm of experimental, ambient, and noise music respectively. Throughout a massive repertoire that consists of full-lengths, EPs, splits, singles, limited cassette runs and 7” releases etc. PRURIENT is one of the most important artists to define and reinvent the genre of noise music which in turn has made Fernow one of the premiere visionaries in the entire genre of experimental music.\nThroughout the years PRURIENT has been known to constantly shape shift its sound into many mutations and incarnations within the noise genre through massive layered walls of sound consisting of harsh feedback, tortured vocals, meticulous sampling, machine-like industrial pounding, entrancing synth work, enticing beats, and waves of electronica to create an aura that treads the fine line of harsh noise extremity and atmospheric beauty.\nPRURIENT’s first full-length album since the 2011 game changer “Bermuda Drain” sees Fernow deliver the most ambitious and massive PRURIENT album to date. A double-album clocking in at a near 90-minutes entitled “Frozen Niagara Falls”, the new PRURIENT album is set to define Fernow even more as a master within all the genres PRURIENT tends to crossover into. In what encompasses moments familiar from the entire PRURIENT catalog along with creating something entirely new and different from what PRURIENT has previously done, “Frozen Niagara Falls” (in which its journey began to manifest in late 2013 and was finally completed on Valentine’s Day 2015) could very well be recognized as the PRURIENT magnum opus.",

            "about": "“Rainbow Mirror”, the latest work from renowned noise-music artist PRURIENT, is a release exceeding three hours in length, consisting of new PRURIENT material that delves into the more glacial, meditative, and ambient side of Dominick Fernow’s cult within the realm of noise music creating an epic of pure 'Doom Electronics'. “Rainbow Mirror”, which will coincide with the 20 year anniversary of PRURIENT, is a project that is steeped in history and origins, and will be released as a 4xCD and digital through Profound Lore on Dec 1st, with the 7xLP vinyl edition to be released on Hospital Productions. The cover art for “Rainbow Mirror” is the first PRURIENT collage ever made.\nLike the first Prurient live performance 20 years earlier, the 'Rainbow Mirror' lineup consists of three members. For this ambitious work, Fernow called upon Matt Folden (Dual Action) and Jim Mroz (Lussuria) to form the trio. All of the material was recorded live in the studio and later meticulously mixed and produced at Shifted’s studio in Berlin with expert mastering by Paul Corley.\n“Rainbow Mirror” marks the second alliance between Profound Lore and PRURIENT and stands as another singular monument amongst the vast repertoire Fernow has amassed under the PRURIENT moniker. While familiar moments from the landmark “Frozen Niagara Falls” album can be found within the massive scope of “Rainbow Mirror”, through the three-plus hour duration of this rural ambient industrial creation, “Rainbow Mirror” is a monolithic crawling cinematic noise scape that brings in even more dynamics and structure through this expansive and introspective new observation. The intense, unforgiving, trance-inducing aura of “Rainbow Mirror” is presented through waves of time-stretching electronics, layered counterpoint feedback, machine loops and extended droning, pulsating synth passages.\nLike the infinite and distorted reflections produced by a hall of mirrors, \"Rainbow Mirror\" is a portrait in perpetual tension.",

            "about": "Originally released as a bonus cassette to Prurient’s ‘Rainbow Mirror’ ‘Unknowns’ is two side long collaborative tracks from Dominick Fernow joined by longtime producer Kris Lapke from Alberich with Patrick O’Neal from Skin Crime notoriety. HMO was the earliest project from O’Neal starting in the late 80s and early 90s that could be a rural american counterpart to England’s Nurse With Wound middle period. Consisting of unrecognizable, discomforting electric acoustic noises mixed with radiation noise, Prurient fills the void with sub bass electronics and a caustic reading of the ‘Rainbow Mirror’ short story written in collaboration with Scott Bryan Wilson. A vocal counterpart to the otherwise instrumental ‘Rainbow Mirror’ album. the B side is a reworking of field recordings and woodland screams recording in Rhode Island and reworked in NYC around the time O’Neal and Fernow first met. Housed in a deluxe sleeve with manual artwork by visual artist Adam Marnie, whose works have been featured previously on Prurient’s epic ‘Frozen Niagara Falls’.",
