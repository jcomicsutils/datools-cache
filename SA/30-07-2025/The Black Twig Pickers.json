            "about": "Following a series of records with Thrill Jockey (including the sensational Seasonal Hire with Steve Gunn), the Black Twigs return to the VHF mothership to continue their charming and original take on Old Time and Appalachian-inspired string band sounds. Together since 2001, and a continuous presence in the music’s true home of Southwest Virginia, the Twigs represent the actively working evolution of the traditions – learning songs from other locals, playing dances at the Floyd Country Store, etc – without retro-artifice or nostalgia. The ragged-but-right performances and recording (and Sally Ann Morgan’s perfect cover design) sit at the ideal intersection of DIY/”underground” and local string sound values. On Friend’s Peace, the band travels a range of styles, from the lovely harmony on the trad-classic “Moonshiner” to the racing fiddle/guitar/banjo on the “Money Musk” medley. Mixed in with the traditional songs are several perfectly-placed original tunes, including Mike Gangloff’s keening “Cara’s Waltz” and Isak Howell’s solo guitar spotlight on “Barnswallow.”",
            "credits": "released April 2, 2021\nSally Anne Morgan: fiddle, vocals\nMike Gangloff: Hardanger-style fiddle, octave fiddle, vocals, singing bowl, sruti box\nNathan Bowles: banjo, washboard vocals\nIsak Howell: guitar, harmonica, sruti box\nwith Andrew Zinn: guitar, tenor guitar, vocals\nand Joe Dejarnette: bass\nRecorded and mixed in Topeca, Floyd County, Virginia, by Joe Dejarnette/Studio 808a; Mastered by Harris Newman/Greymarket; Cover by Sally Anne Morgan\nLaid down before the Great Isolation and offered in hope for the community to come. MOONSHINER: Sally and husband Andrew sing words from West Virginian Currence Hammonds’ version of this widespread song, with a melodic structure from John Gallagher. If you haven’t heard Currence, or John’s album with Scott Prouty and Chris Coole (or with Dwight Diller and Tom King), you should. MONEY MUSK/ICY MOUNTAIN/TOMMY HAWK: Sally and I start the song with Money Musk, inspired by Dwight’s recording of James Hammons (a cousin of Currence and son of fiddle giant Edden), then everyone joins in for Icy Mountain, learned partly from the recordings of WV/Ohio fiddler Ward Jarvis. The medley’s third part is Tommy Jackson’s (and maybe Hark Garland’s) song Tomahawk that Jackson had on one of his 1950s square dance albums and which entered the folk repertoire in the fiddling of Ward Jarvis, among others. We’d heard recordings of Ward playing it at his home but it was Steve Kruger’s playing at Blacksburg, Va., sessions that started us. CARA’S WALTZ is one of my songs inspired by my wife and has been played many times for the dancers at the Floyd Country Store in Floyd, Va. SHEETS OF RAIN, STREAMS OF SUN is a dream of changes of cloud and light across the mountainsides, sometimes slow, sometimes less so. WILL YOU MISS WHEN I’M GONE? is one we’ve sung for years and always is better when Andrew is with us to knit together the harmony, as he does here. ROAN MOUNTAIN SALLY ANN comes from the mighty Roan Mountain Hilltoppers, whose skill and power and sheer welcoming exuberance should be inspirations for anyone playing this music. KNIGHT ON THE ROAD: First heard from Maddy Prior and Tim Heart, but Sally found a version collected by Artus Moser of Western North Carolina. BARNSWALLOW: Isak calls this an inadvertent tribute to our pal Charlie Parr, also part of a long, ongoing attempt to catch some of the sweetness, simplicity and dissonance of Elizabeth Cotten’s beautiful playing. ST. VALENTINE’S MARCH & ELLISTON JOY: Two love songs -- one grew from the other after Cara asked if the tune had words. The banjo sticks came later. DAN FRIEND’S PIECE is a West Virginia tune we picked up years ago from the magnificent recordings of Ernie Carpenter. For us, it became a lament for our friend Jack Rose when we played it at memorials a decade ago. Then it opened farther and farther, taking us into all sorts of spaces, a winding path to renewal.\n-- Mike Gangloff, Ironto, Virginia, August 2020\nTunings: Instruments were mostly in usual old-time A, D or modal tunings, dropped a half step. So fiddles were either (low to high) G#D#G#D# or G#C#G#D#, with sympathetics on the hardanger setup\nspread across those tunings. Banjo was (5th string first, then low to\nhigh) g#D#G#CD#, g#C#G#C#D#, or g#D#G#C#D#. Guitar was EADGBE, capo’d somewhere to fit the song. Harps were A-flat, D-flat\nand F#. Bass was EbAbC#F#. Andrew tunes on the spot.\nAll songs traditional, these arrangements © 2018/2020 Black Apple, except Cara’s Waltz; Sheets of Rain, Streams of Sun; St. Valentine’s\nMarch; and Elliston Joy by Mike Gangloff, © 2018/2020; Barnswallow\nby Isak Howell, © 2018/2020; Will You Miss Me When I’m Gone? by\nA.P.

            "about": "Sprawling 4th full length from the Black Twigs finds a slightly reshuffled lineup and a renewed emphasis on kicking out raw, percussive takes on both Appalachian traditional and original material. With Ralph Berrier Jr.'s retirement from the group, Mike Gangloff has added fiddle to his already considerable arsenal, and along with stalwart guitarist Isak Howell, brought in Nathan Bowles (Spiral Joy Band) on percussion and several guests who make substantial contributions to the party. The Twigs work the fine line between the Friday night old-time dance party and the wellspring of grim and evocative tragedy that runs through the tradition, delivering these laments, travelogues, and wild whoops with sawing, rocking joy. This is a sprawling collection, with visceral group takes on \"Crossing the James,\" \"Cherry River Line,\" and \"Old Joe Clark.\" Charlie Parr and Lane Prekker join the crew on \"Last Kind Word Blues,\" \"Train 45\" and \"Twin Sisters\" (first essayed by Pelt way back in 98) with Parr's amazing, ragged voice leading the charge over Bowles and Prekker's driving percussion. Along with the full group material, the Twigs throw in other welcome oddities such as Howell's Fahey-like \"At the head of Every Creek,\" \"P.E.A. Vine Blues,\" an arrangement of a tune from Portuguese Africa, and a book ending solo version of \"Crossing the James,\" with Gangloff on baritone banjo.",

A decade ago, when he welcomed me into his home and his music for a couple years of\nvisits, he’d tell great tales of him and a cousin riding their horse home after performing at house parties in the years before World War II, the mountain roads so dark that he couldn’t see his cousin sitting directly in front of him and trusted the horse to know its way. And he described\nhow when the train brought in a weekly shipment of livestock, someone was always playing fiddle or banjo at the depot, music in the air.\nThat sort of street old-time is where we've hitched ourselves in recent years. We haven’t found a weekly livestock shipment, but we’ve busked on sidewalks and streets –and piers and parking lots – and next to a\nsno-cone stand on the Outer Banks. Taking the sound out into the world, into the air, has helped us find our own place in this music of so many spheres.\nIt’s about the music, but here’s who we are:\nBlack Twig Pickers\nIsak Howell: Guitar, harp, rattletrap, vocals\nMike Gangloff: Fiddle, banjo, resonator guitar, vocals\nNathan Bowles: Washboard, washtub, fiddlesticks, kazoogle, vocals\nWith Amy Shea, Chris Howell, Tim\nThornton, Charlie Parr & Lane Prekker\nSound as time machine: Playing on the Charlottesville mall, a washboard, guitar and banjo thumping hopefully along behind an open case, flash of realization that we could be at any point in the last century or before.\nSound as personal archaeology: Trying to trace via fiddle and banjo a branch of my family’s wanderings through Southwest Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky; tracking the songs once common to the counties around us, giving them another breath.\nSound as compass: lodestar for the made-at-home, non-prepackaged, non-standardized, not-for-(much)-profit, everyone join in. Brothers and sisters. Playing the people's jazz.\nCoolidge: saw the music as a highway or a railroad or a river that connected almost everything -- his stories of the animals who danced in his barn or the woman who could change the weather with her clawhammer banjo playing, countless festivals, shows and porch sessions, the living and dead, and even me, a struggling banjo-er who'd just arrived from out of town.\nInstruments: I played an old fiddle that Pete Ross of Glasgow, Va., restored to life. \"It was in pieces,\" he told me, and truly, the more I look\nat it, the more of Pete's handiwork I see. It's a marvelous instrument. On Twin Sisters I played a late 19th-/early 20th century Tyrolean fiddle that Amy Nichols lent me. I played a fretless banjo, one of Lo Gordon's Cedar Mountain creations from his workshop in Brevard, N.C.; a resonator guitar put together by Bill Blue of New Smyrna Beach, Fla.; and a gutstrung, tackhead baritone banjo that Steve Salay and I built awhile back. Isak played a Martin dreadnought whose sound has never been adequately captured on tape. For the songs with Charlie, Isak borrowed Tim's smaller-bodied parlor guitar Martin, thinking it would record more clearly. Tim warned him it had a few buzzes, and it did. Isak's rattletrap is a custom model that Isak continues to modify, adding and subtracting nails from the boards, putting a layer of foam rubber between the planks for cushioning, switching the ties for the tambourine, and other tweaks that occur to him late at night. Nathan's washtub came from Farmer's Supply in Floyd, Va. His kazoogle is something Isak found somewhere. His washboard came down through Amy's family. It's a Sunnyland model made by the Columbus Washboard Co. back before they started printing\ntheir web address on the boards.\nThank you\nWilla, Tycho, Ivy, Elsa, Emily, Mikel (for help with recording, etc.), Emily, Alex Clayden, Bill, Kevin Long & Cellar staff, Woody Crenshaw and everyone at the Floyd Country Store (especially the dancers, which takes in nearly everybody), Laurie Lewis & Green Dolphinians, WPAQ, Sam Linkous, Aaron Rosenblum, Chip & Ashley & family (a new record for attending Black Twig shows), Thorntons, Sue, Tom, Eric Langston, Vinton convention folks, Hope Hollingsworth, Jeyon,\nCasey Elder, Frances West, Ralph & Ruth & Lucy, Purple Fiddlers, Phil & Kelly, Jumpin' Jim & Brenda, Jack, Patrick, Amy Nichols & family, Richard Bowman for thoughts on local repertoires, and Glenn Jones for inspiration and example re: extreme liner notes -- I haven't matched you on clarity or insight, but I'm clearly catching up on length.",

            "about": "Midnight has Come and Gone is the third album by this Southwest Virginia group, and is another set of classic old time, country blues, and Appalachian folk. Since 2003's Soon One Morning, the Black Twig trio of Mike Gangloff, Ralph Berrier, and Isak Howell has expanded to a quartet with the addition of bassist Mike Gayheart. Midnight Has Come and Gone is made up of mostly of original material, road tested at gigs and festivals along the Blue Ridge. Topical stormers like \"Fire in the Stove\" and \"Blood Red Clay\" are live staples, belted out here in a virtuoso hail of guitar, fiddle, banjo, and rough harmony. In contrast to the more trad sounding fare, the grungy and twisting \"Bent Mountain Drag\" recalls \"Beggar's\" era-Rolling Stones. Continuing the Black Twig tradition of beautiful instrumentals, \"Twilight on the Radford Army Ammunition Plant\" is another hymn-like meditation outside the showy-offy bluegrass tradition. \"Original Natural Bridge Blues\" is a song from 1941, which has been recorded in an incomplete fashion by many groups over the years. Ralph's discovery of the original 1940's sheet music in a family photo album revealed a lost verse, presented here for the first time.",

            "about": "First CD by this now well-known group, raw edged takes on Appalachia, old time, etc. Completely authentic. The Black Twigs represents the continued persistence of a type of Appalachian folk music that has come and gone from the popular radar over the years, but has never really disappeared from the band's Southwest Virginia home. The songs on \"North Fork Flyer\" are mostly traditional numbers (with a few originals sprinkled in) that form the backbone of a century-old tradition - the music of bonfires, front porches, coal miner's festivals, and informal gatherings. Over the years, \"mountain ragas\" (as the group calls them) like \"Angelina Baker,\" \"Spike Driver's Blues,\" \"Poor Boy Long Ways From Home\" and \"Sail Away Ladies\" have been recorded, performed, and revised continually by luminaries such as Bukka White, Mississippi John Hurt, John Fahey, Bob Wills, Holy Modal Rounders, New Lost City Ramblers, etc, etc - a who's who of true American artistry. Recorded live to DAT on front porches and in family rooms, \"North Fork Flyer\" blends fiddle blues, sinewy guitar and the drone and twitch of fretless clawhammer banjo with the band's rough-around-the-edges but warm harmonies. Played to the accompaniment of night insects, passing trains, and the noise of wandering children, the music retains the charm of tradition but is free of fake antiquarianism and nostalgia - regardless of age, the music is just as relevant today as it was 100 years ago and the band plays it like they mean it. The band name comes from the oldest, most crotchety apple variety in the orchard that fiddler Ralph Berrier's family maintains along the musically fertile Virginia-North Carolina line.",
            "credits": "released May 22, 2017\nRalph Berrier Jr: Fiddle, Vocals\nMike Gangloff: Banjo, Vocals\nIsak Howell: Guitar, Harmonica, Vocals\nwith Dan Crawford: Spoons\nRecorded on front porches and in front rooms in Ironto and Roanoke, VA, Autumn and Winter 2000. Thanks to Amy, Chris, Ruth and Tycho, to Bill Kellum, to Tom Angleberger for Artwork, and to the many people who helped write these songs. A few notes: Spike Driver's Blues is from John Hurt, the Monroe Brothers, and all the Nine Pound Hammers; Ralph's Cousin Rafe Brady had a lot to do with Ebeneezer, but Coolidge Winsett showed us how to play it; We wrote Great Valley Mine for the Montgomery-Pulaski County Miner's Association; Reuben's Blues came from Kentucky but ended up somewhere else.",

            "about": "Second album by this SW Virginia area trio. Soon One Morning is firmly planted in Old-Time Appalachian tradition, but concentrates mostly on original material. Standing out in particular is \"Floyd Allen,\" Ralph Berrier Jr's masterful retelling of an area tragedy with a sweet and unexpected major/minor chorus change-up. Mike Gangloff's lengthy and elegiac instrumental \"This War Is Killing Me\" glides along on a sad melody passed around between resonator guitar, cello and fiddle. Many tracks are anchored by Gangloff's unusual gut-string baritone banjo. Two solo instrumentals on the CD add balance between the vocal numbers - Isak Howell's \"Have You Been To Alabama?\" is a subtle fingerpicked workout, while Gangloff's \"Ironto Special\" is a considerably more exotic-sounding modal construction on the big banjo. Elsewhere, there's an upbeat essay of \"Pallet On The Floor,\" a relation to \"Poor Boy Long Ways From Home,\" which appeared on the groups debut North Fork Flyer album. Among the traditional numbers, none is more striking than the group's charging and rough treatment of \"Oh Death,\" with Gangloff and Berrier spitting out the call and response vocal which gives the album its title.",
            "credits": "released March 14, 2017\nThe Black Twig Band is Isak Howell, guitar and harmonica; Ralph Berrier Jr., fiddle and vocals; and Mike Gangloff, baritone and Supertone banjos, resonator guitar, and vocals.

            "about": "So a few years ago, Charlie Parr, country bluesman, songwriter and reso guitar and banjo king of the Upper Midwest, and the Black Twig Pickers, scrappy stringband of the Virginia/West Virginia state line, are kicking up a storm at a house party in Blacksburg, Va. It had already been an evening to remember, with three generations of the Thornton family playing a set that included Curtiss, the eldest, singing a hair-raising “I’m so Lonesome I Could Cry” and accompanying himself on dobro. But now Parr and the Twigs are throwing down, ripping through fiddle tunes and blues while a houseful of rowdies dances, jumps and shouts. But then the guy that lives downstairs decides he’s had enough. Wearing his pajamas and a leather jacket, he’s standing on the back porch yelling, saying he’s calling the cops unless people quit stomping on his ceiling. The Twigs try a quieter, slower fiddle tune. People shout and stomp and shout some more. It’s time to go. Then Sally steps up and says she and her roommates are moving the party to their house, just a few blocks away. It’s Blacksburg, so nearly everything is just a few blocks away. Soon the ruckus resumes at Sally’s, with music and dancing into the early hours. Fast forward a few years. It turns out that Sally, besides being an excellent dancer, is a great fiddler and knows how to call a square dance too. She starts sitting in with the Twigs at dances. And Parr and the Twigs keep playing together whenever Charlie’s globetrotting tour schedule and the Twigs ‘ rounds of community events line up. Along comes EastMont Syrup: part reunion, part hoot, part lament for times and pals gone by -- and part sampler for what’s to come.",

            "about": "House and Land is the duo of Sally Anne Morgan (fiddle, shruti box, banjo, vocals) and Sarah Louise Henson (vocals, 12-string guitar, shruti box, bouzouki). Sally and Sarah started playing together after Sarah opened for The Black Twig Pickers for whom Sally plays the fiddle. The duo quickly discovered that they were both interested in the same very specific forms of traditional music. Additionally, they both viewed it through the lens of their shared love of modern, experimental and minimal music. “We honor what two voices and bodies can do in one moment in time. It totally shapes our sound.”\nTheir playing together is wholly unmediated, without amplifiers and using just two sets of hands and voices. With a minimalist approach, their music considers the space between notes as much as the notes themselves. The material on their debut is drawn from traditional southern hymns and Appalachian ballads that originated in England and elsewhere hundreds of years ago. Microtonality is as essential to certain Appalachian vocal styles as it is to a Tony Conrad composition and the often spare adornment to their singing puts these complexities on full display. The songs, however, are not entirely unadorned. Sally and Sarah are both masters of their instruments and on several tracks they bring in percussionist Thom Nguyen, who plays with an improviser’s ear.\nHouse and Land features many drone elements, which is a direct homage to the presence of drone in Appalachian music. Equally important is their knowledge of the use of drone in contemporary classical music, which itself has often taken inspiration from nature-based drone styles from around the world. This connection between nature and minimalism is not uncommon and can be seen in artists like Agnes Martin and composers such as Éliane Radigue and John Luther Adams. Repetition is linked to music across the spectrum that evokes trance and other spiritual states.\nA historical review of ballads tells a history of patriarchy. These songs have been arranged for and by two women with an extensive knowledge of the form and filtered through their own feminist perspectives. In some cases, like in “Rich Old Jade,” their singing bears witness to the hardships women have endured. In other cases, they have changed lyrics to honor women through imagined histories. In “Johnny,” for example, “My father offers house and land” becomes “My mother offers house and land.”\nHouse and Land’s music is less adorned and certainly less processed than much popular music today. The hand-hewn quality transports the listener to another time the way a Shirley and Dolly Collins recording can. The themes are universal and the songs intergenerational. “Home Over Yonder,” for example, came from the singing of Frankie Duff of Lexington, Kentucky, who passed away in January 2017 at the age of 102. While there is a temptation to view this music nostalgically, this would be a mistake. This living music is constantly being rearranged. The obscure songs on this album, like many well-known traditional songs, are in a state of nearly constant evolution, a testament to their continued significance. Naturalistic and entirely modern, the music of House and Land continues this tradition with its own contemporary and beautiful interpretations.",

            "about": "Both scholars of the regional sounds and advocates of an ecstatic and highly personal approach to the music, the Twigs hold down local dance and bar gigs, play all manner of celebrations and every so often, hit the road. Along the way, Isak Howell, Nathan Bowles and Mike Gangloff kept company with some of underground America's heavyweights and haunted the doorsteps of Appalachian fiddle and banjo masters. They've played for the National Council for the Traditional Arts and for audiences overseas. And they've put out a string of acclaimed albums, including 2008's Hobo Handshake and last year's Jack Rose & the Black Twig Pickers.\nIronto Special is an album of traditional Appalachian old-time tunes (and two originals) that they've learned through study of both local old-time musicians and old-time records and field recordings. The instrumentation is all-acoustic and features some of the old-time usuals – fiddle, banjo, guitar – and some less-routinely-heard-in-today's-old-time-scene implements like washboard, bones, fiddlesticks, mouth harp and jaw harp. Plus (on one song) a one-of-a-kind baritone resonator 12-string guitar. Old-time music served, and continues to serve, a variety of functions in Appalachian life – from dance music to somber solo performance to raggier blues and everything in between. Ironto Special is an attempt to celebrate this variety in the old-time tradition through the band's process of learning and growth as they explore the music's many facets.\nAs a result, the band is in a constant state of evolution as they gleefully tackle this music that fascinates and enraptures them. Mike Gangloff's fiddle playing is driven by often-frenzied bow rhythms and a steadily improving technique, which combine with his near-religious fervor of gathering tune variations, giving him a large range of expression on the instrument. Isak's guitar is as chugging and powerful as ever, but this record is really his standout harmonica showcase. Perhaps the biggest change from Hobo Handshake to Ironto Special is Nathan's move to the clawhammer banjo. The washboard attack of Hobo Handshake is still present on a few tracks (and bones and fiddlesticks make welcome appearances), but the majority of the cuts are a snapshot of Nathan's growth on clawhammer banjo, further allowing Mike (previously the band's primary banjoist) to soar above it all with his idiosyncratic fiddle style.\nRecorded throughout 2009 in the Shred Shed in Ironto, Virginia, Ironto Special is entirely recorded in single takes. There are no overdubs on the record in any form. Although Ironto Special is their Thrill Jockey debut, the Black Twig Pickers have recorded several releases for VHF, The Great Pop Supplement, and Klang. Mike continues to play in Pelt and the Spiral Joy Band with Nathan. Isak has also recorded and played with both bands. At some point, these three musicians realized that old-time music is a living, breathing art form, not just music that was recorded in the 1920s or 30s, and it managed to bring them all together. Old-time music is not something that needs to be re-enacted or revived – it's doing just fine and all they did was to step in and take part. They are not pretending to have grown up in the music or in the part of Virginia they now call home, but like the many who have come before them and passed on their knowledge, they consider themselves to be a part of the music as much as anyone else, and Ironto Special is their contribution to the continuously flowing tradition that will eventually be passed on to the next generation of players.",

            "about": "The Black Twig Pickers and Steve Gunn have traveled in the same circles for years, but it wasn't until the first Hopscotch Festival in Raleigh, NC that they got the chance to play together. The Twigs’ Mike Gangloff and Nathan Bowles convinced Gunn to join them in a rendition of “Lonesome Valley” an old traditional spiritual, during a laid-back day party, which was received with overwhelming enthusiasm. Steve held down guitar, Nathan sang and played banjo, and Mike laid into a fiddle and sang harmony. Although Gunn has joined the Black Twig Pickers during live performances since, this 7” is the first time they have appeared on wax together, and they celebrate the event by reprising “Lonesome Valley,” with Isak Howell wailing on harmonica.\nThe flip side shows is a two-fiddle scorcher, with Gangloff joined by Sally Morgan. The duo take a run at the Virginia-North Carolina border tune “Sweet Little Julie,” a dance favorite in its home territory. This single, presented with a letter-pressed cover made by Morgan, is just one more example of the singular approach to old-time music by the Black Twig Pickers.",

            "about": "The Black Twig Pickers are a group defined by their forward thinking approach to a type of music most often associated with times gone by. Over the course of eight full-length records, including collaborative releases with Jack Rose and Charlie Parr, a split LP with Glenn Jones, and numerous EPs and singles, the group has established itself as a collection of dedicated practioners of old time music re-cast and shaped by their appreciation of modern improvisation, drone, and punk. While not at odds with the experimental scene that has fostered them or the old time circles they travel in, The Black Twig Pickers thrive in the in-betweenness of those two worlds, proving that the exploration of the outmost bounds of sound and the exploration of decades old tradition and community aren’t as different as one might think.\nRough Carpenters, which was recorded in the same two-day session as 2012’s Whompyjawed EP, can be seen as an inward-gazing foil to that EP’s long-form hoedown epics. With the addition of Sally Anne Morgan on fiddle to the trio of Mike Gangloff, Isak Howell, and Nathan Bowles, dance has become a more prominent part of the group’s formula. It wasn’t until Morgan joined the band that the band actually began to dance onstage. Also, on this album the group strays a bit farther outside their intensely local Southwest Virginia tradition than earlier records, incorporating a few more tunes with origins in Kentucky (“Banks of the Arkansas”) and West Virginia (“Little Rose”). The group’s repertoire is constantly growing as they turn to first-person sources, older musicians that were brought up in the old time scene and in some cases the children and families of deceased respected practitioners, and unreleased archival recordings passed among musicians. And while local and regional history is ever present in the music The Black Twig Pickers play, they turn songs that are many decades old into living artifacts, released from the restrictions of era by the personal convictions of the musicians.\nThis spirit of ecstatic abandon is conveyed through the percussive elements of The Black Twig Pickers’ music and more importantly, through a spontaneity and an unrehearsedness the band wears as a badge of pride. As Gangloff explains, “It’s not the melody, it’s the moss.” The sharp twang of the banjo, a spontaneous holler, a foot stomping along in time, and other seemingly incidental sounds become all important. Like the band’s previous Thrill Jockey full-length Ironto Special, Rough Carpenters was recorded with absolutely no overdubs and in as few takes as possible. The Black Twig Pickers are indeed rough carpenters, building unpolished but finely crafted records that embody the spirit of a timeless old-time scene.",

            "about": "Banjos and fiddles, boards and bones in hand, the Black Twig Pickers dove into a living tradition of old-time music that surrounds their homes along the Virginia/West Virginia line and never looked back. Both scholars of the regional sounds and advocates of an ecstatic and highly personal approach to the music, the Twigs hold down local dance and bar gigs, play all manner of celebrations and every so often, hit the road. Along the way, Isak Howell, Nathan Bowles and Mike Gangloff kept company with some of underground America's heavyweights and haunted the doorsteps of Appalachian fiddle and banjo masters. They've played for the National Council for the Traditional Arts and for audiences overseas.\nThe trio have toured the UK in the company of both Jack Rose and Charlie Parr, accompanying Rose on a series of raucous UK shows to celebrate the Jack Rose & The Black Twig Pickers album released in 2009. Rose and Gangloff were of course longtime band mates in drone masters Pelt, symbolizing the band's emergence into traditional music from a more experimental background (Bowles is also now a member of Pelt and both he and Gangloff perform as part of Spiral Joy Band).\nThey also followed Rose onto Thrill Jockey's books, releasing Ironto Special, an album of traditional Appalachian old-time tunes (and two originals) in 2010. That same year they also released an album of traditional gospel music, Glory in the Meeting House, with Parr contributing his trademark sturdy-but-sweet vocals and resonator guitar. In 2011, the Twigs collaborated with Parr on a Record Store Day split LP for Thrill Jockey, with the flip side featuring recordings from Cambridge, MA based guitarist Glenn Jones. Through study of both local old-time musicians and old-time records and field recordings, the trio have literally come to old-time from leftfield, purely through their love of the music, and found they can hold their own with the old-timers, constantly tearing up the Virginian highways to keep commitments at bars, country fairs and parties, while simultaneously turning on their more avant listeners too. Bowles has also become a powerhouse banjo player of growing repute, with his first solo album in the works.\nThe Black Twig Pickers take it to the dance floor on Whompyjawed, offering long-form, highly rhythmic and deeply layered takes on traditional fiddle and banjo music. Joined by some of the musicians who frequent the Southwest Virginia square dance and flatfooting scene -- fiddler Sally Morgan, and bassist/guitarists Sam Linkous and Joe Dejarnette -- and by a troupe of accomplished feet-percussionists, the Twigs work up propulsive and mesmerizing versions of two side-long songs. \"Merry Mountain Hoedown\" is an old-time rocker with Mike Gangloff and Sally Morgan's duo fiddles sawing atop a careening bed of pounding feet and furiously locked-in banjo, guitars and bass, while \"Brushy Fork of John's Creek,\" with Sally fiddling and Mike banjo-ing, wanders more spectral -- but no less ferocious -- territory, with Nathan Bowles' washboard and Isak Howell's guitar and mouth harp guiding a long and shifting mix of clattering drone.
