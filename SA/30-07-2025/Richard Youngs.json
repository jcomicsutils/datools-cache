            "about": "Outrageous album of prog rock from Richard Youngs and Andrew Paine's ILK. Canticle is a long promised follow-up to the group's 1998 CD Zenith, which was released on Richard's No Fans label. Unlike Richard's more \"minimalist\" solo records, Ilk drapes his songs and voice in thick layers of heavy jams, and then piles on the production tricks, vocal layers, Steve Howe-style leads, synth bleeps, and other racket in beautifully intricate arrangements. Canticle is clearly influenced by the classic UK progressives but unmistakably contemporary. \"A Guiding Principle\" and \"Landsong\" marry Richard and Andrew's multi-tracked voices with over the top full rock-band arrangements. \"Honour's Prospect\" mixes mystical narration with some searing fuzz-guitar leads, and is followed by the bass-heavy march of \"The Weight of Stars.\" \"Tilling\" shimmers and echoes, leading into the spacey and cosmic \"Outward & Homeward.\" The folky \"Of Souls\" serves as a fittingly simple epilogue to the suite. Veronica Rennie's cover art completes the package in highly appropriate style.",

            "about": "The untitled album of duets by the nowadays unavoidable Acid Mothers Temple leader Kawabata Makoto and Richard Youngs shows the pair in a relaxed, yet psychedelic mood. The five untitled tracks here play simple modal melodies performed on acoustic guitar, autoharp, organ, voice etc against swirling production and layers of shifting audio haze. Track 1 has Richard's immediately identifiable voice, guitar, and autoharp against Kawabata's spacey echo treatments - track 3 reverses the process with Richard's minor key picking cutting against Kawabata's thick, visceral bowed drones. Tracks 2, 4, and 5 all use a base of lovely fingerpicked guitar melodies, layering on organ, synth, tape effects, and echo until a suitably mellow cosmic vibe is achieved. All in all, some of the most beautiful sounds ever issued by either of these two gents, best known for their edgy experimental work.",

            "about": "NO FANS COMPENDIUM is a deluxe limited edition 7 CD set of Richard Youngs’ recordings for his long-running private NO FANS label. 5 CDs are Richard’s personal selection from his NO FANS releases, all of which were issued in tiny editions (20 – 50) and only available for sale at Richard’s rare shows or at Glasgow’s now defunct Volcanic Tongue shop. In addition, Richard has included two full discs of material previously unavailable in any form - a recording from 1989 pre-dating his earliest widely-known work, and a new recording from late 2014. Unbeatable as a survey of Richard’s career, everything here is of equal quality to his over-the-counter releases. In keeping with his penchant for unpredictable stylistic mashups and reinventions, there are folky laments, achingly beautiful “songs,” tape collage, rude prog noise, minimalist experiments, multi-tracked vocals, etc.",

            "about": "Second collaboration between these two stalwart titans of the true UK underground, coming 8 years after their first pairing on the Site/Realm LP. Relayer (the title no doubt a nod to the odd resemblance of 7 year old Rosalie Bower's cover art to another LP of the same title) throws out the live methodology of the LP for a dense set of layered studio recordings. Like the music of Bower's Sunroof! group, the tracks are rainbows of colors and textures with string drone, percussion, bleeps, and the unidentifiable competing in a mix devoid of the traditional \"lead with backing\" schema. Many tracks have the kind of welcoming electronic bed seldom heard since the demise of Harmonia, with ring modulated fuzz bleeping away over a chugging, but non-oppressive beat. Elsewhere, there's Youngs' Riley-style organ ping-pong, a little virtuoso Kalimba, thick wads of analog synth....you know where this is going.",

            "about": "\"20 Years\" is a celebration of 20 years of music from Richard and Simon, featuring 4 previously unreleased albums. The set includes an all new LP, \"20 Years,\" that is the first new vinyl from R!!! and S!!! in almost 15 years. The other three projects presented here on CD were all completed and intended for release by the duo during their prolific 1990's, but fell by the wayside for various reasons.\n\"20 Years\" is a newly recorded LP, and is one of the heaviest, most uncompromising records of Richard and Simon's long career. The record consists of 8 electro-acoustic reworkings of their first (unreleased) recording from 1987, and is a blistering set of tracks as wild and weird as anything they've ever recorded.\n\"SMIRR\" consists of 4 epic instrumentals in the vein of classics such as \"LAKE\" and \"Asthma and Diabetes,\" flowing with extended grandeur, mixing drone and eccentric instrumentation in the duo's immediately identifiable style.\n\"Songphase\" is a record of 10 simple, lovely tunes - a reminder of the duo's considerable \"trad\" songwriting and performing prowess. While Richard has worked some in this style in his solo efforts, hearing Simon match him song for song is a revelation. \"Dream Song\" is among Richard's most moving pieces ever.\nFinally, \"LIVE!!!\" is a head-scratcher of a live album, recorded live in-studio in full on Dada-ist style. Features extended clavinet mania, Casio jams, and plenty of outre' expression.",

            "about": "\"5 Years\" is the venerable duo's first release since \"Lammergeier\" (vhf#58) in 2000. After recording and releasing nearly 20 albums between 1990 and 2000, Richard and Simon decided to try a novel and opposite approach to music making - they met once each year to record a solitary 10 minute track. The results show the duo remarkably unaffected by the half decade that elapsed - the tracks on \"5 Years\" reflect their long established signature mix of \"real human\" instrumental expression and explosive musique concrete sensibility. \"2002\" starts with several minutes of looped snippets building up subtle patterns as they slide in and out of phase, leading to a change to a tremulous chord organ driven section. \"2003\" starts with a drastically filtered base of hand drumming, with full-on hand-on-the-knob tweaking, before giving way to an over the top fuzz organ solo that sounds like Mike Ratledge on 200 rpm. \"2004\" is a throwback of ululating noise as heard on 90's efforts such as \"Metallic Sonatas.\" \"2005\" is based on electronically treated percussion, the sparest and most minimal track of the bunch. Recorded mere weeks before release, \"2006\" finishes where we started, with a baffling electronic test pattern drone that segues into a section of beautiful, weird ambience.",

            "about": "Originally issued in an edition of 300 on their No Fans label and for all intents and purposes unavailable and unheard for a decade, the 10th anniversary CD-ification of Richard and Simon's classic debut double-LP still sounds as revelatory and alien as it did when it was released. Tracks like the immortal collage freak-out \"Dance: Help The Aged (Give Them A Heart Attack),\" the minimal pulse epic \"Chord\" and the psych-fuzz rock mania of \"Goat\" have been undiluted in their majesty by the unbearable decade that has elapsed between then and now. Highest rating. Remastered from the original 1/4\" analog reels, sounding much improved over the original pressing. New liner notes by Simon. 4 (really 15) tracks, 73 mins.\n\"We're listening to LAKE close on a decade since we recorded it. Just as it sounds odd now, what we do today would've sounded bizarre then. We couldn't make this record now. It's like a ghost - so long ago. We've moved on. Our label name, No Fans, was a statement of fact; the record was a dare to ourselves - who in their right mind would ever release anything like this? With No Fans, No Distribution and No Prospect of either, spending over 1,000 pounds on a vanity project when most of our peers were doing sensible things smacked of arrogance. In an ironic bid to launch Lake, a Goat Evening was held in Nottingham at the home of Neil Campbell and Jim Plaistow. Though everyone had a good time, by the end of the evening no-one had bought the album, so we gave away copies to the three people who had shown any interest. Which left 297 copies. The situation was more ridiculous than ever.\"\n--Simon Wickham-Smith",

            "about": "LAmmERGEIER is the first new recording by Richard and Simon since Metallic Sonatas recorded way way back in the spring of 1998. Following closely on the heels of the VHF reissue of the duo's classic 1990 debut LAKE, LAmmerGEIER finds the duo continuing to pursue the head-scratching assortment and range of outer sound in a somewhat more contemporary style. LAmmERGEIR makes use of all sorts of exotic instruments, but like Metallic Sonatas, many of the pieces have undergone electronic transformation, adding an extra layer of ??? to the tunes. Some of the sounds show the influence of Simon's laptop work over the last couple of years, tho' the duo now claim that this is an all analog deal. Laptops aside, the layers of microscopic detail on LAmmERGEIER should give listeners plenty of practice in differentiating sounds that are produced by complicated software or tape loops or whatever, and sounds that are produced by a guy whacking a baking tray with a stick.",

            "about": "Recorded in 1998 just prior to Simon's (as it turned out, temporary) relocation to Australia. In contrast to the song-oriented action of Pulse Of The Rooster, Metallic Sonatas is 15 short slices of searing, electronic-sounding mayhem. Performed on Electric Sitar, Voice, Glass Harmonica, Drum Machine, Electric Cifteli, Electric Banjolin, Violin, Cello, Cardboard Boxes, Casio, Electric Shirt-Reinforcer, Electric Bass, Guitar, Bowed Cymbals, Electric Thai Harp, Clockchimes, Reed Organ, and Bagpipes, the sounds have been mutated into towering alien sculptures evoking the \"texture\" of metals. Each piece is short and novel-sounding enough not to slip into dreary repetition and like most of R!!!&S!!!’s releases, somehow makes the most unusual music accessible. Out of print for many, many years.",

            "about": "Pulse Of The Rooster is R!!!&S!!!'s self-proclaimed \"psychedelic\" album. What jumps out from this record is how prominent the vocals are, with every track containing substantial vocalizing. Richard and Simon's untutored-but-just-right singing fits perfectly with their eccentric kitchen-sink approach, and gives the music an identifiably English melodic sensibility. Behind the vocals is a sometimes howling, sometimes gentle miasma of electric dulcimer, casio, drums, electric bass, electric guitar, electric sitar, thai harp, violin, glockenspiel, penny whistle, and shakuhachi. The record even features a couple of nods to period psychedelia with some wacky production tricks.",
            "credits": "released December 1, 2017\nRichard and Simon sing and play: bowed electric Appalachian dulcimer; Casio; drum machine; electric bass guitar; electric cifteli; electric sitar; electric thai harp; electric violin; glockenspiel; penny whistles (Bb and F); shakuhachi; silence.\nRecorded Harpenden, England, 3-5 June 1997\nThank you to Kaiser Mark for loan of bass guitar, to Lucinda McNair for taking the photograph; & to Yasuko Nakajima for translation and calligraphy",

            "about": "Red and Blue Bear is a simple but charming children's story written by Simon and illustrated by Richard. The CD is R!!! & S!!!'s demented \"performance\" of the story. There's anglo-folky laments, bizarre improv, casio madness, found sounds, etc, etc. The breadth of material is similar to LAKE. \"I consider Red And Blue Bear to be inappropriate for my kids, the bear is too trusting.\" - Matthew Bower.",
