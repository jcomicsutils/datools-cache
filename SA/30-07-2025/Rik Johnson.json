There is a theme that winds through it based on a piece I recorded in autumn of 2022 titled \"The Storm\".\nThe final mixing and publishing of this album coincides with the biggest snowstorm we've had here (mountains of northern Colorado) in over 4 years. This is a coincidence.\nMy equipment isn't much compared to other's who do this sort of music. I have several guitars, a bunch of stomp pedals, and a 20yr old Korg CD-RW 4-track mixing board. I master all tracks on an inexpensive computer using free software.\nI worked on this for 2 months. I like it.",

            "about": "In 1991, I bought an Ensoniq SQ2 synthesizer. With that and a little Tascam 4-track cassette recorder, I put together a lot of experimental nonsense. In 1996, a friend of a friend offered to clean up a few of those recordings and put them on CD. We printed up 50 of them and they sold pretty quickly. This is that collection of songs.\nThe price of most things goes up, but not music. Not anymore. I sold those CDs for $15 a piece. I'm offering the album plus a bizarre bonus track for the low low price of nothing. Pay what you like or pay nothing.",

He helped produce tracks 1, 5 and 10, did all production on 17, and gave me vm recordings for tracks 3, 12 & 16. This project was mostly fun but also brought back some bad memories, most of which Kevin and I laughed about.",

            "about": "A collection of songs that were recorded with little or no thought on the afternoons & evenings of 4/24 - 4/25, 2020. Every piece is in the key of C, except for the occasional A minor. Same difference. The idea was to create a flow with no measurable bump from track to track.\nThese pieces were made possible with the extra time allotted me by Covid-19 and the consequential isolation. Thank you, plague.\nAll proceeds from this album will go to  getusppe.org/donate/#online.",

            "about": "In early May I released the album Mostly All I C. It's an album of tracks mostly recorded in the key of C, with a couple in A minor which is of course relative to C. I was listening to this album this morning while running through the mountains and it occurred to me that it might be interesting to play all 9 tracks at once.\nAnd it sort of works, I guess. Track one, the title track from the original album, is the only exception, as it slips into a C minor progression at times. So, I did one mix (track 1 on this album) without it, and another mix (track 5 on this album) with it set towards the end of this longer mix.\nOutside of my experimental music, I've spent decades writing and recording a lot of \"normal\" music. One of my influences since the late 80s has been Bob Mould. \"Slowly I Mould\" is a nod to him.",

            "about": "In 1982 I moved into an apartment with my girlfriend. I was 18yrs old. I had my music stuff set up in the extra bedroom. I wrote a lot of music at that time, mostly experimental and nothing worth noting. But there was one riff I came up with that I never forgot. I recorded it. In 2014 I messed around with it and put drums and bass to it.Track 1 of this collection begins with the result of that. It then goes to a second part, and then a third. These parts were released as separate tracks on my album With Hands Too Mumbled in 2014. I took the time to remaster them. As a single track, it is intentionally compressed to a point where it is at times uncomfortable.\nThe remainder of these track were recorded in autumn 2019. They are reflective of where I was during this time.\ntjm/r",

            "about": "After a deep silence, mingled with sweet dreams, I asked, \"Speak to me of that beauty which the people interpret and define, each one according to his own conception; I have seen her honored and worshipped in different ways and manners.\"\nShe answered, \"Beauty is that which attracts your soul, and that which loves to give and not to receive. When you meet Beauty, you feel that the hands deep within your inner self are stretched forth to bring her into the domain of your heart. It is the magnificence combined of sorrow and joy; it is the Unseen which you see, and the Vague which you understand, and the Mute which you hear - it is the Holy of Holies that begins in yourself and ends vastly beyond your earthly imagination.\"\n- Kahlil Gibran\nFive songs; remixes of previously released tracks. Assembled in this collection for relaxation, thought, meditation.",

            "about": "I record all my music on a Korg D1600 that I bought in 2004, which is a dinosaur piece of equipment. And that's ok and I don't care until the little hard drive inside of it gets full and I have to start deleting songs from previous album projects. That's what I ran into a few weeks ago. Again.\nBefore clearing the hard drive, I remixed a few of the pieces I did from spring 2017 through winter 2018. With good scotch and strong ales, I took parts of a number of songs, looked at them again, focused on passages and tones that I liked, played with them and came up with these tracks. I'm happy with the results.\nI offer my music for free because I have an actual job, and I make music only because I love it. My brain is weird and if I charge anything for it (which I've done) it somehow changes what I do. I prefer just letting it go out to the interwebz. If you care to \"donate\", that's fine. If not, that's fine too.",

Tracks 1, 3 and 8 are remixes and edits from recent recordings.Tracks 6 and 7 are from a March 2013 release that got very little attention but I felt deserved another look.\nI've said to a few people with whom I'm very close; I make this music for myself, because it's what I want to hear. But it's nice when anyone else listens and enjoys it. Each song, each album, is a soap bubble of goodness I send off to the world and will be there for a very long time. Everyone should do something similar. Put some good out there.",

I have always enjoyed listening to music while I fall asleep and he wanted some music he could listen to while he fell asleep. Listening to these tracks now, I'm sure I failed at providing him soothing music; but the songs are still pretty interesting anyhow.\nThese are about half the songs I recorded for that album. I really didn't care for the others.",

            "about": "Almost 8yrs ago I released this album on Bandcamp. It was my first Bandcamp release. It was something I'd thought about for a while and finally put some stuff together and made an album. It features one of my personal favorite original pieces, \"Drowned Men Sank Backwards To Sleep\".\nI've remastered the original tracks and added 3 bonus tracks. It's good stuff and I hope you get something from it, although we all know this year has not been better than any year. In fact it's probably one of the lesser better ones.",
