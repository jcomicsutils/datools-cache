While the next track, “Rodney’s Last Ride,” takes a similar overall shape, cello skidding into blister and glitch, the gloomy tension of “Then Fall Fell” comes in part from Lonberg-Holm’s just-restrained distortion, holding off the pyrotechnics.\" - Free Jazz Blog",

      "about": "\"Prog rock has been the object of much derision since it mutated 20 years ago into such unpleasant musical organisms as Kansas, ELO, and Supertramp. But the 90s being the decade of guilty pleasures, it’s not uncommon these days to encounter ghosts of proggers past in the least likely places. Broken Wire totes some of the genre’s typical baggage: sectional tunes, extended space for soloing, synthesizers and electric guitars mixed with strings, melodies that float over odd, jumping meters and squalls of hard-rock backbeat. But on their debut, Broken Wire (Eighth Day Music), these four accomplished local improvisers never settle for mere retro; even Jim Baker’s “Shooting an Elephant,” a song actually composed in 1969, sounds quite current, especially during Baker’s frightening electric-shaver synth solo. Cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm contributes four cool tunes, two of which (“Wheat in the Pocket” and “Bobby”) have a distinctive Middle Eastern flavor, as does the group’s cover of Nubian funkster Ali Hassan Kuban’s “Om Sha’ar Asmar Meddafar.” Daniel Scanlan hops from electric guitar to fiddle to (least successfully) brass with trademark freneticism, and percussionist Michael Zerang handles the dizzying time signatures with ease–on his “Blonde in Beirut,” he starts with sensitive hand percussion, then kicks out the additive-metered Arabic jams on a full kit. But the record’s smash hit should be the cover of “Ida Lupino”–Scanlan passes for Carlos Santana with a classic-rock solo over Carla Bley’s melancholy line, while Baker (who is fantastic all record long) creeps in with one of the most surprising keyboard solos I’ve heard in ages, an off-time version of the melody that sounds like it’s being tuned in on a radio. This performance, sadly one of the very last musical events at the Lunar, is a release party for Broken Wire.\" -John Corbett, Chicago Reader\n\n—\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

That set - with James Singleton on bass to round out the trio - will be released on LP in 2023 as the third title on Instigation Records.\n\n\n\nWith precious few recordings of Survival Unit III, every new release is a cause for celebration, and a perfect encapsulation of the spirit of the festival: honoring the history by crafting the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nABOUT INSTIGATION RECORDS:\n\n\n\nInstigation Records serves to release historic documents from the Instigation Festival archive and highlight new work by members of the festival's expansive community. Founded in 2016 by guitarist & improviser Steve Marquette and movement artist Marie Casimir, the Instigation Festival hosts a biannual week of interdisciplinary performance between the Chicago and New Orleans improvised music, movement and video arts communities.",

      "about": "Stirrup is Fred Lonberg-Holm (cello, tenor guitar), Nick Macri (bass), and Charles Rumback (drums). Formed in Chicago in 2009 to explore their mutual interests in deep grooves, moody harmonies, and extended structures, the genre-defiant trio continue to do so to this day. A true collective, all three write and arrange for the band.\n\n\n\nThe Avondale Addition is an amalgam of two of Fred Lonberg-Holm’s long-running projects: Stirrup and his “Lightbox Orchestra”, a revolving-door project that began over 20 years ago as a way to organize large, ad-hoc improvising ensembles using a light-based cueing system and cue cards. Typically, a Lightbox concert has no pre-composed materials, but for this performance recorded live at Elastic Arts in Chicago, compositions by members of Stirrup comprised a “book” from which the guest musicians (the “+6”) draw on in addition to freely improvising when called on to do so.\n\n\n\nIn effect, Charles and Nick continue to do things they might normally do on a Stirrup gig, but instead of Fred playing cello, he acts as a kind of improvising arranger stationed behind his Lightbox cueing station, with the invited guests taking on the melodic and soloist roles he might normally perform.\n\n\n\n----- -----\n\n\n\n“…this just hits like an especially robust excursion into the beauty of avant-Chicago...with stretches that roll and even groove; in terms of rhythm (movement) and foundational sturdiness, The Avondale Addition is a substantial ride (that lasts for just over an hour). Everybody plays at a high level, and this [is] splendid stuff. ”\n\n– Joseph Neff (The Vinyl District)\n\n\n\n“The Avondale Addition” is my first interaction with Stirrup’s output, and the fourth in their catalog. The core trio of Charles Rumback, Nick Macri and Fred Lonberg-Holm is bolstered by a wonderfully balanced 6 piece ensemble of key players from the Chicago jazz scene. The most familiar all-stars to me are Keefe Jackson and Mars Williams, but man are there great moments from everybody! While there is very engaging solo work shown from all players, it is the way this ensemble is sequenced together and the sections align which is most compelling. Lonberg-Holm is one of my favorite cellists and a world class improviser (veteran collaborator with Brotzmann, Braxton, Vandermark et. al) but doesn’t play a note here, instead functioning as “lightbox operator”, using a tool for conducting/conduction developed elsewhere in his discography and on beautiful display here. Little to no context is given for the lightbox methodology or process, but it certainly explains the optical and kinetic ensemble arrangements on this disc. There are clear heads and written out sections that square up with a familiar vocabulary of experimental “big band” and harmolodic group writing, but the transitions between them feel controlled with a tasteful splash of precision and ease. One can imagine and almost hear visual cues fading in and out, like multiple projectors firing static loops set in motion upon the same surface and producing repetitive and evolving patterns. Bassist Nick Macri carries rock steady ostinatos throughout many of the pieces with a firm pizzicato (not to mention amazing harmonic and textural control of arco style elsewhere!), over which the Lonberg Lightbox drives dynamic solos and combinations from the ensemble, several of whom are switching instruments throughout. One is reminded of the Zorn game pieces, if they incorporated more repetition and slower groove oriented rhythm sections. Players are paired against and on top of each other, heads are brought back at just the right time to accentuate a soloist wailing, and the timbral blend from each of the melody players is chameleon-like. Violist Jen Clare Paulson stands out as a great ensemble glue-machine, able to occupy a full sound range inside of the horn section, and against the other strings. Clearly something new to be found with every listen here, and i expect we’ll be spinning it in the store for awhile!” - Frank Meadows, DMG\n\n\n\n“…hypnotic...pretty melodies unfold, roil, and mutate over churning ostinatos and shuffling, shape-shifting beats…extended, lyrical solos hit with the power of psych-rock…and tickle the ear with microtonal glissandos a la Arabic or Indian music..swing patterns, explosive rolls, and skittery flourishes…” – Peter Margasak (The Chicago Reader)",

      "about": "\"The ten untitled improvisations radiate a kind of almost spiritual refining of Lonberg-Holm’s deep, personal relationship with the instrument. He channels and distills his extensive experience to the most essential, in an honest, sober and unpretentious manner that still sparks with the initial innocence and passion to discover new, fascinating sounds.\" - Salt Peanuts\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nRecorded live, this album presents Lonberg-Holm in an intimate relationship with his cello, beautifully recorded by Joaquim Montes at Studio Namouche in Lisbon. Using a variety of extended techniques, he conjures a barrage of multiphonics, interwoven timbral excursions, and minuscule textural knots lined along the peripheral architecture of these pieces. Lonberg-Holm alludes to his music having a non-denominational devotional presence in his life, and this relationship is evident in these deeply personal improvisations. This is visceral playing: heavy, dry, honest, and unpretentious. Lonberg-Holm has performed in an exceptional number of free jazz and free improvised ensembles, not to mention with a variety of indie rock bands; one can hear this experience permeating the seasoned playing in these recordings.\n\n\n\n-\n\n\n\nArtist's statement:\n\n\n\n\"Over the years, I have made a number of solo recordings, some in studios such as the now demolished Airwaves in Chicago and the first ESS location (now gone as well), some in concert halls (e.g., Mills College), some outdoors (my father’s farm in central NY as well as the Florida Everglades), and a few at various homes I have lived in. Location has an obvious impact and my long and affectionate relationship with Lisbon inspired me to want to make a solo document there. I have recorded with a variety of projects at Studio Namouche in the Benfica neighborhood of Lisbon and love it. That was where I wanted to make this solo recording.\n\n\n\nAnyone who has been to Namouche knows it is a magical place. A faded version of its once probably grand self, Namouche is a sort of small RCA studio A that somehow survived the tumults of the recording industry; it still has the right proportions and materials on the walls, floor and ceiling. Add in good mics, a mixing desk, and the very capable ears of head engineer Joaquim Montes and it’s about perfect.\n\n\n\nI’ve described the cello as a “four string busy box” for many years but only recently did I realize it also acts as a “safe space” for me. Although the outcome of pressing the various levers is more unpredictible on a cello than a busy box, I still feel that if I follow the material where it wants to go, nothing can go wrong. It is an act of faith.\n\n\n\nFor many years, “religious” music has been a source of entertainment and inspiration for me. In spite (or because?) of my lack of religious identity I find beauty in many types of music for worship. Over the years, at different times, I have been obsessed with Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Buddhist musics, sermons and chants. While I sometimes fantasize about making a record of religious music, the only faith I can claim to have any real relationship with is Christianity and a recording of Christian music might be misunderstood so . . . I refrain. Instead, I like to think that my solo cello improvisations are a kind of non-denominational devotional music.\n\n\n\nDuring the period when this was recorded, I was listening a lot to Alfred Reed. He seems to favor a very low A (almost A flat) and I experimented with tuning my cello down as a result. Some of the tracks are at that lower pitch and others are closer to A440.\n\n\n\nNamouche has a very fine grand piano and a number of other excellent keyboards. They also have some derelict pianos. Most noticeable are the two in the front vestibule and the one in the live room. The short piano pieces were recorded using only the piano in the live room. Because such wrecks aren't found in most good studios, I couldn’t resist playing it. The juxtaposition of a derelict instrument and an incompetent pianist in a great room with excellent equipment was simply too good to pass up.\"",

This is probably the most important lesson learned in collective improvisation.\" - Fotis Nikolakopoulos, Free Jazz Collective\n\n\n\nTrumpeter, improviser and educator Benjamín Vergara (1982) was born in Santiago de Chile, and now based in the city of Valdivia, Chile. His work focuses on composed contemporary music, free jazz, improvised and experimental music. Professor in music improvisation at School Of Music And Sound Art at Universidad Austral de Chile (UACh), Vergara has collaborated with a huge range of musicians, ensembles and multi-disciplinary projects. He is the director of experimental music festival Relincha, occurring since 2014 in the city of Valdivia. /  benjaminvergara.com\n\n\n\n Chicago-based cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm (1962) has played and studied music in a variety of situations from The Juilliard School to the gutter. A former student of Anthony Braxton, Morton Feldman, Bunita Marcus and Pauline Oliveros, his primary projects are his Valentine Trio and The Lightbox Orchestra. He is also a member of a number of ongoing collective projects as well as participating in numerous one off ad-hoc or in frequently convening ensembles. He plays in various groups led by renowned saxophonists Joe McPhee, Peter Brötzmann and Ken Vandermark. /  lonberg-holm.info\n\n\n\n Kingston-based experimental musician and visual artist Aaron Zarzutzki (1987), recently performing and releasing as Zoots Houston, describes himself as “an improviser of various sorts”. He works primarily with misuse and perversion of objects and systems. As he says, virtuosity, volatility, futility and capability are thought of. Known for his self-made electronics and as an innovative turntablist, Zarzutzki has recorded and released remarkable duo albums with like-minded artists such as Brent Gutzeit, Nick Hoffman, Graham Stephenson, Richard Kamerman and Fred Lonberg-Holm.",

      "about": "\"Repeated listenings bring out the playfulness, the endearing craziness of the music.\" - Graham Rickson\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice Recordings’ Chicago origins were heavily galvanized by regularly seeing sets by cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm and multi-instrumental improviser Zoots Houston. Both have since separately relocated to Kingston, NY, where they continue to engage with the kinds of musical exchanges exemplified here. This set, recorded live at Chicago’s Elastic Arts, finds them performing with percussionist Ben Bennett. Bennett, a musician and performance artist, is a notable figure in the current and vibrant free improv and jazz scene in NYC; recent collaborations include Michael Foster and Jack Wright, among others. All three players metaphorically deconstruct their instruments while scattering pockets of agitated hot air on the performance floor, augmented with pedals, radioesque static sweeps, tightly propelled breaths, and extended techniques. This is dry, heavily structural, bristling stuff, with periodic digressions into melody and a strong control of focused and at times uncomfortably magnified timbres. Much of the material is urgent and electronic, filling the space and remaining firmly gestural. These two sidelong sets display slices of time coming from strong voices within this niche of contemporary improvisation.\n\n\n\nReviews:\n\n\n\nGraham Rickson/The Arts Desk \n\ntheartsdesk.com/classical-music/classical-cds-weekly-beethoven-bruckner-notice-recordings\n\n\n\n TJ Norris/Tone Shift: \n\ntoneshift.net/2019/12/26/pinkie-no/\n\n\n\n Frans de Waard/Vital Weekly: \n\nwww.vitalweekly.net/1211.html",

      "about": "\"Percussionist Michael Zerang and string player Fred Lonberg-Holm are, like Gustafsson, second-generation free improvisers who know not only their Cage and Stockhausen but also jazz, rock, and other contemporary musics (Zerang, for example, is an expert in ethnic rhythms)—-which is not to say that all of these can be heard in 35 Grapes (19 Shown). Working from similar precepts as Christmann and Gustafsson, they put their own spin on this spontaneous process of construction. For one thing, these are longer pieces—they take more time to construct their edifices, and occasionally choose to linger over certain textures or emphasize a particularly complex rhythmic context. Due to their more varied instrumentation, they utilize a larger palette of colors, harmonics, overtones, and microtones. Lonberg-Holm switches from cello (on which he displays more classical training and technique than Christmann) to the tangy Chinese fiddle (erhu), the prickly mandolin, and the harmonicalike melodica. Zerang uses percussion not for timekeeping but as a source of pitched and unpitched colors, and his lightness of touch provides a subtle clatter rather than a rock-hard presence. If it could be said that Christmann and Gustafsson use their material to carve out a kind of stark, unpredictable, Calder-like mobile sculpture, then by way of contrast Zerang and Lonberg-Holm construct a kinetic sculpture of moving parts in the manner of Naum Gabo. Each has its own viability, its shifting moods, its special brand of charm. As music, they're just different, that's all.\" - Art Lange. Issue 23:1 (Sept/Oct 1999) of Fanfare Magazine.\n\n\n\n\"Like two abstract visual artists painting on the spot, these two begin with an idea of where they going and travel down some treacherous courses with little guidance. The results are uniformly stunning and enlightening. Zerang and Lonberg-Holm have done this sort of thing with others many times before, but this is clearly one of their best.\" - Steve Loewy, AllMusic",

Both halves contain breadth and depth well beyond the simplicity of a duo.\n\n\n\nAnker and Lonberg-Holm’s duet plays on all their strengths. Their extended improvisation takes a kind of narrative approach with the titling, “Ice King” / “Melt” / “The Frigid Air” / “Cold Only Hurts Those Who Feel,” and the playing is thrillingly free.
