      "about": "“Cliff House Hotel” represents the reworking of a very recent soundtrack to a multimedia installation we created in an abandoned and mothballed mid-century boarding house/hotel in central Illinois. The exhibit was the third in a series of multimedia shows that employed abandoned places as a medium, rather than simply a venue. \n\n\n\nAnyway, this album is a detailed remix of numerous elements that were used in a video and quadraphonic sound system set up across two floors of the old hotel. The exhibit was called “Absence and Presence”, and that’s what this album is about as well.\n\n\n\nFollow the stairs from street level, and mind your head….\n\n\n\n\n\nRecorded December 2024\n\nADM 32",

      "about": "The album “What is the Light of? was released in 2012 as a special edition CD-R package with an X-ray film stock cover, as well as an extended track on a second disc. That track, “Navigating Frozen Nigeria” was the result of a live-in-the-studio recording from the same period. The extended track was not included in the later digital download on Bandcamp. We can’t remember why. \n\nWe have had several requests for the lost track, and so why not? We remastered it a bit, and it is now available here as a digital single.",

      "about": "A little while ago, we released a new album as a digital download on Bandcamp. We were very pleased with the response, but also wanted to give a shout-out to a number of our listeners who chose the “pay more if you want” option that Bandcamp offers. Many of you were very generous, and we just wanted to let you know that the gesture is indeed appreciated. It’s heartening to see such responses to the work.\n\nSo, as a small thank you, we wanted to put out a new piece as a freebie. And that’s what we’re doing, as a free download on Bandcamp. However, we also had to record something that fits the current mood, and so we chose to remix something from our album “Land of Monkeys”, recorded during the first administration of the Angry Orange Man. Facing the same (or perhaps worse) climate as the last go-round, we chose a track suitably dark for the situation but perhaps surprisingly so as a gesture of thanks. But there you go…..",

However, much of the material predated that album. We’ve never had many words to describe August 53rd, and that may have something to do with the fact that it’s always been one of our favorites. \n\n\n\nSo, six years later, we are releasing a digital version on Bandcamp – as originally mastered prior to remastering for vinyl, and also with an additional “Real Time” live-in-the-studio track.",

So, taking the liberty (as we do) to revise history, we’ve remastered the best bits of both albums and combined them into what is probably a much stronger thematic suite. Present in this album are pieces from our third CD-R release, “1874 from 1968”, which was only available for a short time nearly 20 years ago, as well as the majority of “The 31 Rusted Articles”, which was released a couple of years later. Both drew their inspiration from 19th-century American lore, as well as the coming of autumn. Remixes, reconfigurations, and everything remastered in 2020. As the man said, history is bunk.\n\n\n\nADM 30\n\n2023",

The field recordings were made along the banks of a backwater lake and in the shadow of an aging power plant, following a spring flood. Twenty-six years earlier, one of the members of Fossil Aerosol purchased a homemade instrumental cassette tape recording (marked only “sacred”), at a thrift store in downtown St. Louis, Missouri. In 2016, fragments of the found cassette recordings were mixed with those made in the mud along the river.\n\n\n\nADM 24",

      "about": "Six artifacts with various provenance, bound together.\n\n\n\nOver the past five years or so, we’ve recorded a number of pieces that, for various reasons, are not included in our catalog of released or unreleased albums. Sometimes, these tracks consist of live-in-the-studio experiments, revisits to old material, or simply thematic anomalies that we just can’t find a place for. These tracks are beginning to pile up, so we have assembled two albums worth of such orphans for digital release. \n\n\n\nIncluded in this first collection is an extended track (“Two Zeros in the Bottom Drawer”) composed of bits and pieces from our long-lost third release (1874 from 1968), which is been out of distribution for sometime. “Harps Head” is a live-in-the studio rendition using elements that were contributed to the collaborative “Patina Pooling\" project with :zoviet*france:. \"Cassette Opalescence\" is a result of the rediscovery of a box of 4-track cassettes from the \"Environmental Adjustments\" sessions from 1997. Also included is a reconsideration of the obscured side of a certain lunar body, recently featured on the radio program \"A Duck in a Tree\".\n\n\n\n(Note: we lowered the price on this one a bit, as it contains the track ”Cassette Opalescence”, which was previously offered as a single download on Bandcamp.)",

      "about": "“Nigths and Profecy” Special Multimedia Edition for 2021\n\n\n\nIn 2020, we revisited a much earlier project (“The First 15 Minutes of the Second Sequel”), which employed audio artifacts from a single, obscure zombie film released in 1980. This time around, we asked 400 Lonely Things to join us, and the result was a combined cassette, “Nigths and Profecy”, released by the Helen Scarsdale Agency.\n\n\n\nTo adapt to the cassette format, several tracks were left behind. For the summer of 2021, we are releasing the complete set of tracks from the original Fossil Aerosol sessions, as originally mastered for CD. This edition also includes a special remix of one of the longer tracks, as well as three short videos (totaling over 20 minutes) made from the original source material by filmmaker Matthew Konicek. These films are the closest visual expression of Fossil Aerosol that we have yet to see, and capture the character of the damaged fake decay of the early 1980s quite effectively. \n\n\n\nOver 80 minutes of multimedia, apocalyptic immersion.\n\nADM 26\n\n\n\nVIDEOS\n\nThe videos are included as \"bonus materials\" in the download of the full album, and consist of three MP4 files: \n\n\n\nEtruscans Behind the Manor\n\nFake Tomb\n\nNotti Reliquary",

We have also observed how utterly surprising the character of such an actual event has been, and how off-the-mark most of our imaginings turned out to be. \n\n\n\nTwo albums of recordings were created during this time - between the late winter of 2020 and early 2021. The second will be released first. \n\n\n\nAfter nearly a year of isolation, a brief real-time, studio interaction happened in late February 2021, and resulted in a suite of recordings (Volume II) that were largely without theme or plan. No new source material had been collected, and instead was culled from a library of elements used in the previous 10 years of recordings. These were stripped from their original contexts, and a series of live-in-the-studio passages essentially made no attempt to observe the year 2020, a pandemic, or the end of yet another baffling US regime. \n\n\n\nOnce again, looking backwards to see forward.\n\n\n\nADM 25",

      "about": "Sounds from films about fake corpses constitute some of the earliest material used by Fossil Aerosol Mining Project, beginning with a section of a film trailer found in an abandoned drive-in movie theater in 1983. The first full-length album to focus on the topic was “if you loved the dawn of the dead”, which was a digital-only release on iTunes about 15 years ago and which has since been pulled from distribution. Some of the material from that album was remixed for the 2009 “Resurrection Remixes.” But we were still weren’t convinced. So, in 2014 we created the compilation “Zombi Traditions”, which like its predecessors was released as a digital download only. Meanwhile, “The First 15 Minutes of the Second Sequel” (2008), and last year’s “Nigths and Profecy” also dealt with artifacts of the imagined zombie apocalypse.\n\n\n\n During all of this reanimated revisionism, certain tracks were left behind while other tracks merited remastering or even remixing. So, during the lockdown last year, that’s what we did. We addressed the entire zombie back catalog, culling from it what we thought was the strongest and most representative material, remixing or remastering just about everything, and at the same time pulling in the missing pieces. \n\n\n\nThe result is a fifteen-song collection of synthetic resurrections from the Reagan Era - our desert-island selection of fake dead bodies and the worlds created for them.\n\n\n\nThis album is available here in 3 versions: a full resolution download, a professionally duplicated pro-CDR, and a special edition (limited to 50 copies) that features hand-crafted, artificial skin covers and a download code pointing to an additional 40 minutes of material.\n\n\n\nADM 27",

The basic tracks were recorded in 2010, and were remixed and remastered in 2014. The source material for the work consists of dissociated fragments from nearly-lost genre films of the 1970s, filtered by scratched celluloid, bad splices, dropouts, and damaged control tracks.\n\n\n\nThe Day 1982 Contaminated 1971 was released on vinyl by the Helen Scarsdale Agency in 2015. The first 200 copies of the pressing included fragments of 1970s intermission film, recovered from an abandoned drive-in theater during the early 1980s and affixed to the cover art of the album.\n\n\n\nThis digital version includes \"Noice, Coak, and Pre-1982 Occurrences\", an extended / remix track that incorporates elements from several pieces on the LP.",

The backlog of completed unreleased albums, however, is such that it is unlikely all will find their way to CD or vinyl any time soon. And as we generally release the work in roughly chronological order, the most recent material tends not be heard for some time. So this spring, we’ve decided to flip the timetable and release a new suite of recordings as they are finished.\n\n\n\nThe core tracks of 3.2016 were mixed during March of 2016. On the 23rd of the month, elements from several of these tracks were reanimated live in the studio under a Paschal Moon. The result was an additional 23 minutes of real-time compositions.\n\n\n\n3.2016 is being made available immediately upon completion as a full-resolution download, while the tiny ones and zeros are still warm.",

The recordings on this album are hybrids, created by the grafting of old artifacts onto new material using recently devised studio processes.

      "about": "The very first mixes that were made under the moniker Fossil Aerosol Mining Project date to January or February of 1986. They were produced on the floor of a 2-room apartment, using three effects pedals (one of which gave a nasty little 9-volt shock), two radio/cassette players (one utilized for its bad source switch), some recordings of a Moog Prodigy made three years earlier, and a Radio Shack four-channel mixer. The result was a series of long, improvised mixes that were soon forgotten, and replaced by very different strategies in the studio. \n\n\n\nIn February of 2016, in observation of the 30th anniversary of sitting on the floor and receiving minor shocks as we embarked on the Fossil Aerosol project, we created a new, 23-minute extended mix that employs only material recorded and/or mixed during those first winter 1986 sessions. The piece is a 2016 composition, but it is built entirely of 1986 - turned inside out and frontways back 30 years later.",

      "about": "In 2015, Fossil Aerosol worked with filmmaker Matthew Konicek on the soundtrack to his new video short, \"Some Historical Shrines of 1934\". Using a unique process that affects both the video and audio tracks, the film is an exploration of hyper-manipulated time and the inadvertent layering of history.\n\nUsing the looped audio from the original rough cut of the video footage, Fossil Aerosol recomposed selected fragments employing their own time-compression techniques, creating a 15-minute, freestanding composition. Portions of that composition were then used in the final cut of the film, which also reintroduced real-time, looped elements from the footage. This track is the original 15-minute cut.\n\n\"Some Historical Shrines of 1934\" can be seen here: \nvimeo.com/125835732",
