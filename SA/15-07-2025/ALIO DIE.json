      "about": "Intricately detailed dream ballads never stray too deeply into the dark, instead giving off an optimistic radiant glow.\n\nAs delectably melancholic as it is determinedly bright..\n\n\n\nOn thirteen tracks of Cosmospir, India Czajkowska presents an otherwordly melange of spherical atmospheres, psychedelic arrangements for prepared Piano and bizarre dream states filled with field recordings and swarms of sonic micro particles. Adding Cello, Flute and Guitar to the mix and sieving the elements through subtle Software filters, “Cosmospir” thus cuts through genre barriers like a fiery sword. \n\n\n\n“It's an attempt to call the deepest, intimate layers of the psyche,one's own internal space related to time, bringing narrative in an invented but individual language”. DM Schneider describes the album in his introductory words, “It's a way of breaking through to a hidden side, where we can get to know ourselves and the invisible mist surrounding 'reality'. Behind this mist there is an open space and we have much more to do with it than with anything in (our) everyday existence, even though we’ve just realised it there.”\n\n\n\nExtracts from “Cosmospir” confirm the suspicion that India Czajkowska has used the years wisely, establishing a confident style of her own, which nonetheless offers plenty of obvious associations. Remarkably, her intricately detailed dream ballads never stray too deeply into the dark, instead giving off an optimistic radiant glow. Even her slow, simmering beats always seem to march forward instead of passively marking time. As a result, her debut points to a future that is as delectably melancholic as it is determinedly bright.\n\n\n\nbyTobias Fischer,  www.tokafi.com",

At a meditative length (cave painting), at night, it tells of Watemark days and of \"Ascent of Mount Pindaro\"; Aglaia looked up at the summits near the clouds.",

Each piece has been written and proposed for the listener to forget the known time for a rather unusual, unmarked but perceived time (Rotovia and Soft Wind). The legacy of the old masters of the environment becomes palpable and is welcome (Lymph and parfumes).",

Without boundaries defined flows in search of deep resonances , he meets them; there is surrender to the masses of stray sounds timeless , direct with a slow move towards peace .",

      "about": "Despite the fact that Piotr Jurczak lives and works in his native Poland, his choice of nom-de-musique and his musical attitude is so akin to soft but dark Italian ambientists like Oöphoi and Alio Die that it reflects that family resemblance. And \"Hidden\", his latest beauty, has in fact been released by the former´s own house label. \n\nEach of the first four pieces, devised 2005-06, is named after one of the cardinal points of the compass, while the penultimate track encompasses \"All Directions\" and the finale zeroes in on the \"Epicenter\".\n\nUnlike a majority of beatless ambient artists who wish to or inevitably end up evoking pastoral scenes and moods (when not lost in space), Busso de la Lune seems to be much more at home in the city, taking pleasure in the (\"hidden\"?)intercourse between nature and civilization - rain spattering against concrete sidewalks and the windows of soaring steel and metal skyscrapers.Up onthis base he tests the timbres and echoes of various devices at hand -hollowed-out woods, a xylophone, the human voice. The deep inhale and exhale ofthe third track sounds like the very lungs of the city expanding and contracting.On the fourth point of the compass he hangs twinkling stars of pin-prick sound high up in the night sky, miles above the listener´s ears.\"All Directions\"could easily serve as the soundtrack for a riveting, wordless, twenty-three minute noir movie, with its suggestive wash of sound, sensually stroked up right bass and aimlessly wandering footsteps on rain soaked pavement, eventually and seamlessly seguing into the - gasp! - \"melody\" that is the closer.\n\n\n\nStephen Fruitman /  sonomu.net",

      "about": "“Intangible Opacity” dares to visit the place where the Earth’s atmosphere ends and the infinity of space begins, following the physical and chemical processes that occur in the ionosphere. The sound is based on warm but at the same time somehow distanced synthetic textures, and classical “el-music”.\n\n\n\nGino Fioravanti, alias Aglaia, that with each new release continues to expand their vocabulary and to enriches its palette of sounds and colors. The immersive power of this work has reached the pure fusion with listening, a liquid quality.. osmotic, it is an act that rejoins the source of consciousness from which all true art springs.\n\nThe electronic sound have lost any artificial appearance and seem to be generated directly by the flow of blood, breath, meditation and dreams ..\n\nThe unfathomable depth of these two new albums does not fail to amaze me, his regenerating power and ability to harmonize different levels , has qualities that go beyond, the music ranges with atmosphere and interior spaces that open up, and follow each other from one track to another, respecting the invisible stages of imaginary multidimensional paths in their incessant and relentless pursuit.",

      "about": "This recording is inspired by the piano works of Olav Fartein Valen (25th August 1887 - 14th December 1952). Valen was a Norwegian composer, notable for his work in atonal polyphonic music.\n\n\n\nValen first came to my attention via the excellent documentary 'Heimvegen', a 12 part series about my friends, Enslaved. \n\n\n\nAs I was creating the tracks for this album, I would send rough mixes to Grutle Kjellson, who is a distant relation of Valen. Confusingly, Valen was Grutle's great grandmother’s cousin, his great great great grandfather’s grandson and his great great grandfather’s nephew! \n\n\n\nIn response to listening to my creations, Grutle would reply with voice memos about the life of Valen. Insightful and complementary to the music, giving a deeper context to the album and life of Valen, I thought it only logical that these voice memos be included. Many thanks to Grutle, who offered so much insight and gave so much time to this project. \n\n\n\nHAN VALEN is released in 3 editions –\n\n\n\ni. DOWNLOAD\n\n\n\nii. CDR: EDITION OF 25 COPIES : SOLD OUT\n\nThe CDR contains all the download tracks plus an extra track, Utbrudd. This will not be available for download. The professionally pressed CDR is issued in an edition of 25 copies. The disc comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve .\n\n\n\niii. CDR + LATHE CUT LP: EDITION OF 25 COPIES\n\nThe lathe cut features ‘Opp Og Ikke Gråte Mixes’, alternative and abridged versions of the download and CDR versions of the album. This version will not be available for download. Package also includes CDR mentioned above.\n\n\n\nMAY 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "ZENERPHOBIA is released in the following formats:\n\n\n\ni. DOWNLOAD.\n\n\n\nii. DOWNLOAD + CDR. EDITION OF 35 COPIES: SOLD OUT.\n\nThe professionally pressed CDR is signed and numbered and comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve.\n\n\n\niii. DOWNLOAD + CDR + HARDBACK BOOK + 3 UNIQUE PHOTOS. EDITION OF 25 COPIES: SOLD OUT.\n\nThe professionally pressed CDR is signed and numbered and comes in a 4 panel ‘Lancing Pack’ card sleeve. This art edition includes a 51 page photobook. No book is the same as each one contains 3 unique original photos. The book catalogues the history of the ‘Zoso Research Foundation’ in pictures.\n\n \n\nZenerphobia is a concept album and is based loosely on the idea of an imaginary horror/sci-fi film.\n\n\n\nThe concept is centred around an international team of scientists researching ESP and telekinesis. Their experiments are conducted on children who have the ‘gift’.\n\n\n\nIn short, it’s a half realised movie, a film I would like to see, maybe an overlooked classic from the early 80’s or the late 70’s. It only exists in my head but has managed to find life in this imaginary soundtrack.\n\n\n\nI’ve not considered a cohesive storyline, but only the visual and aural aesthetics. Sterile tiled rooms in a medical environment, Cold War laboratories hidden in secret locations, diodes and strange machines with wires attached to the heads of the paranormally gifted children, children who can telepathically speak to their international counterparts.\n\n\n\nDue to the continual tests using Zener cards, they have become Zenerphobic and plan to revolt. The children will mete vengeance on the cruel scientists who have made their lives miserable.\n\n\n\nThe dialogue for my imaginary movie appears in various languages interspersed throughout the recording. The voices are meant to represent the international scientists studying the children. They are relaying their observations and results via a secret radio channel and on cassette tape.\n\n\n\nIn between the dialogue are various 80’s orientated ‘Dream Pop’ and ‘Ethereal Wave’ guitar based songs.\n\n\n\nSEPTEMBER 2024 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "In March 2017 I was asked by my friend Graham Erickson to supply ambient sounds and atmospheres for a site specific event. The event involved a number of musicians who played in various rooms around a huge house in Hans Crescent in London. My soundscapes were played throughout the entire house. The event was created for, and funded by, a very famous fashion house to entertain some of its key clients. \n\n\n\nI recently found the multi-tracks on an old hard drive. There was a tentative plan to release them, but that never came to fruition. The hard drive included recordings of all the musicians involved, all their parts have been removed and only my contribution remains on this recording.\n\n\n\nThe original files on the hard drive are 3 multi-track recordings, a 'dress rehearsal' and the 2 live recordings of the two nights we played. The files combined would be just under 9 hours long but have been edited down to under an hour.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Graham Erickson who kindly invited me to participate all those years ago.\n\n\n\nJANUARY 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "In what appears to becoming a yearly tradition, I have released yet another free download that coincides with my birthday.\n\n\n\nThis year's edition is a return to paying homage to the debut album by The Sisters of Mercy, an album and a band that I have cited as being a significant influence, without whom I probably wouldn’t have started making music. I have subtly or explicitly paraphrased, referenced and alluded to them throughout many of my recordings.\n\n\n\nFirst and Last and Always is 40 years old, released 11th March 1985 on my 16th birthday. \n\n\n\nHere are four abstract interpretations of the title track. Eagle eared listeners might figure out that the music is actually First and Last and Always with the notation reversed. It is essentially the song played backwards. \n\n\n\nEach song is 10 minutes long with a total running time of 40 minutes, representing the 40 years since the release of the album. \n\n\n\nI recently had the good fortune of meeting Gary Marx, founding member and original guitarist with the Sisters. The image used for this release is his iconic 'Anaconda' guitar, a photo which I took when we met.\n\n\n\nFurther Sisters related homages and articles by myself can be found here - \n\n\n\n30 MINUTES OF THIS CORROSION CORRODED FOR 30 YEARS \n\nwww.mixcloud.com/andrewowenliles/30-minutes-of-this-corrosion-corroding-for-30-years/ \n\n\n\n THE 20 BEST SONGS BY THE SISTERS OF MERCY AS CHOSEN BY FORMER MEMBERS, COLLABORATORS & MORE \n\nwww.loudersound.com/features/the-20-best-sisters-of-mercy-songs\n\n\n\n FIRST MONSTER \n\nwww.andrewliles.com/discography/first-monster-last-monster-always-monster/\n\n\n\n MARCH 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "Without Wisdom features 8 new songs based on those anxious moments of anticipation in the dreaded dental waiting room. \n\n\n\nIn the 1970s when I visited the dentist, the music they played in the waiting room was slow melancholy jazz, jazz featuring the vibraphone. I alluded to this on my recording 'Bad Vibes Waiting Room', which appeared on the 2007 album Black Hole. \n\n\n\nTeeth. Teeth are not really fit for purpose are they? All my neuroses and fears manifest in my mouth. You have to work at keeping your teeth, it's an eternal battle. Natural teeth are disjointed, irregular shapes and never brilliant white. They are not neat and shiny and all in a row like a Hollywood grin, unless you are lucky of course. There is no beauty in them, they are ugly, they fail, they rot, they don't grow back and at some point they will cause unmitigated misery for practically everyone.\n\n \n\nI have always had weird teeth. My incisors are Draculaesque. I was ridiculed at school for having them. In later life I have been asked several times where I have had them 'done', people assuming I have willingly had them cosmetically altered. I always reply that it's a congenital deformity. What makes them even more pronounced is the fact that the neighbouring two teeth are, bizarrely, still milk teeth.\n\n\n\nI've had some terrible experiences at the dentist. I have been in waiting rooms with people running out screaming. Once, the dentist came into the waiting room covered in blood, moaning about patients only coming to him when they were in pain. I have had unnecessary extractions and unnecessary fillings. \n\n\n\nI was very much a victim of the 'heavy metal' generation. For those who don't know, in the 1970s, the NHS in the UK encouraged dentists to 'restore' teeth, which led to many children receiving extensive and often pointless dental work. The 'drill and fill' abuse of the 70s meant that dentists were driven by financial gain rather than the patients' wellbeing. This resulted in the 'heavy metal' generation, creating victims of the predictable and ugly consequences of when money and healthcare coalesce. \n\n\n\nTeeth. Teeth are not really fit for purpose are they?\n\n\n\nJANUARY 2025: DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "The 11th of March 2024 marked my 55th birthday. For over 40 of those years I'd been attempting to play the guitar and over the decades I have owned many.\n\n\n\nI destroyed one, gave away three and returned one (I borrowed from my brother for over 35 years, a Westone Concord, the pickguard of which is used as the image for this download).\n\n\n\nTwo of the three I gave away were to friends' children. They, like me, were dreaming of being rock gods. I wanted to facilitate their ambitions. To my knowledge, like myself, they have all failed to become guitar heroes. \n\n\n\nThe guitar is an unforgiving instrument. It’s physically painful to play. It takes a long time to achieve any significant results. It’s a slow process and a whopping 90% of would-be guitarists give up on the instrument within a year. \n\n\n\nI have never studiously learnt the guitar in any formal way. I have a rudimentary understanding of chords, barely know anything about the key I’m playing and most scales are a complete mystery. Most dedicated beginners probably have a better understanding of the basics than myself. But incompetence and ignorance haven’t stopped me from making up my own ways of tuning and playing the instrument…and amassing more and more of them. \n\n\n\nI have 18* guitars. There are 18 tracks on this download, each of my guitars getting their own song. Only one guitar is used on each song and no extra instrumentation has been added.\n\n\n\nAll tracks are 3:05 seconds long, a total running time of 55 minutes, 55 being my age at this time. \n\n\n\nThe running order reflects the chronological order of when the guitars came in to my possession. \n\n\n\nClick 'INFO' on each individual track to read anecdotes and stories about each guitar.\n\n\n\n*By the end of 2024 I had collected a further 2 guitars making my collection 20 in total. Tracks 19 and 20 were added in December 2024 as an addendum to the earlier version of this release and to complete the collection.\n\n\n\nMARCH 2024 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "My adoration for The Sisters of Mercy has been well documented, I was obsessed with them in my teenage years, this extended to the splinter groups that formed post 1985, after the demise of the 'classic' line up of The Sisters.\n\n\n\nOne of the bands that formed from the ashes of The Sisters was Ghost Dance. I religiously followed their live shows from their earliest incarnation, up to their untimely end in 1989.\n\n\n\nClose to 40 years later, I happened to be introduced to John Grant, the drummer for Ghost Dance. I, of course, badgered and squeezed him up to the point of bullying for stories of yesteryear and yarns of his time in Ghost Dance. We became friends and latterly he introduced me to Richard Steel, the guitarist of Ghost Dance. One fairly intoxicated evening I proposed making a song together, and subsequently, this project was born.\n\n\n\nMy sometimes surreal life in music has taken me to some strange headspaces with random and bizarre coincidences and chance meetings with fellow troubadours. Fellow creative souls, who were part of my introduction, passion and formative education into music, have somehow, magically, become part of my later life. \n\n\n\nThis release is one of those unlikely alignments of the stars, that has, for me, in some inexplicable way, joined many dots and completed another significant circle in my personal 'conceptual continuity'.\n\n\n\nFEBRUARY 2025 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "Earthy and shamanic (organic), rich textures slither, coil around the ears (embrace), leading the listener into all the remote pockets of unexplored terrain, a full-bodied excursion, and yet the sound is not cluttered or overwhelming. Quite the contrary, the fascinating collage of instruments (including Woodblock rototom, bone flute, rainstick, Tibetan bowls, water pumpkin, bamboo... stones, shells and leaves.. .electronics, samples, etc.) helps to create a diverse canopy under which the mind fills with images of forests (trees sighing...), wind and sky, of the sentience of eons long dead but still infused with vitality. The result is an always expanding array of sounds enmeshed in the fabric of ritual, of sonically soothing spiritual diversions that lead to transcendence, peaceful and yet invigorating. Ah, but within this framework, the heart of the disc grows quite dark,leery, more mysterious... it is a prismatic travelogue incorporating many sonic colours or lacks thereof (reds, yellows, grays...blacks...) in a haunting and sporadically time resistant cocoon... time standing still... losing meaning. A nice transition that keeps the listener always attentive. Calm, though quite invigorating...\n\nJCSmith - Alternative Press",

      "about": "Whilst searching for the original files for a reissue of Aural Anagram, I discovered various unrelated fragments and unused recordings on assorted MiniDiscs and ancient CDRs. \n\n\n\nBack in the day I used my MiniDisc to record voices and environments, places I had visited or locations for specific conceptual reasons. Many of those outtakes are included here. Along with a few CDRs the MiniDisc recordings were entirely overlooked in previous Miscellany releases.\n\n\n\nMy archive of source material, incidental and forgotten audio, have now all been used and released throughout the Miscellany series. This brings the Miscellany project to a conclusion... probably\n\n\n\nMISCELLANY: ADDENDUM is available in the following formats:\n\n\n\ni. DOWNLOAD.\n\n\n\nii. DOWNLOAD + CDR. Edition of 55 copies: SOLD OUT.\n\nThe CDR contains I CURSE (EARLY MIX) which will not appear as a download. The professionally pressed CDR is issued in and edition of 55 copies.

An important page full of unconscious characters and sonorous pigments bring in a evocative context where different acoustic instruments from the Mediterranean the Japanese, the Indian traditions, and not only.. are translate in the sound of the \"Platonica Filosofia\" creating a possible prophecy between soul, earth into a nocturnal and peaceful path.\"\n\n\n\nA land hidden from controlled pleasure of rationality among soul an internal platonic part, it is the first CD by Lorenzo Scopelliti, the single musical expression of Saffron Wood, rich in enthusiasm and love, emboried between discoring and long harmonious. An important page rich in unconscious characters and sonorous pigments put together. In an original evocative hemisphere a thinking walk between the greek Skopelos and the mediterranean Sicily. \n\nThe Friscalettu flutes, the impulsive tibetan trumpet and his bells. The vibrating harmoniuns dances of the sicilian Maranzannu and the Vietnamese Danmoi, the evocative sonority of the Indian Dilruba and the Egyptian Rebab, the shy puffs of the Shakuhachi and the indian Bansuri, the cymbals, the ceramic and glass percussions, are in this way translated and trasformed omeopathicly in \"Platonic Philosophy\" expressing the possible prophecy among soul, ground and the acoustic steps of a special peace.... where we often like to find ourselves.\n\n(Labelpress)",

In follow-upto their \"Healing Herb's Spirit\" release (Crowd Control Activities)Italian multi-instrumentalists Antonio Testa and Alio Die (Stefano Musso) have made a recording of spirited release. \n\nThe six tracks here merge fluidly into one another and massage your brain for just about an hour. \n\nPrayer for the Forest works its spiritual, tribal ways in the droning \"A Mechanical Dust Sphere\".One pictures a deep, lush Costa Rican forest in pitch darkness except for a distant, almost neon vibrant path of silhouetted shapes. \n\nSamples and environmental recordings showcase the underbelly of \"Ancestor's Breath\",a methodical track taking very slow steps towards its end. The cinematic air to this disc is quiet and dark, prowling through your subconscious.\n\n(AmbiEntrance)",

      "about": "NICK PARKIN is certainly no stranger to fans of TUU since he collaborated on the latest album \"mesh\" as a flutist and still in the project Stillpoint. \n\nOn his first solo album, there are hardly any wind instruments. \n\nThe general tone is obviously ambient, not really ethnic, but rather atmospheric (very!) With an experimental character even concret quite amazing (rubbing stones in particular). \"descent\" is very pleasant to listen to even if it will ask for attentive listening and reactive, his calm and fearful side on the sleeping spirits (lived!). Another success for Hic Sunt Leones, quite in line with his previous productions.\n\nHARMONIE / Jean-Marc Boucher\n\n\n\nDESCENT is a different record from what I expected, revealing a complex artistic personality, a musician able to delve into the labyrinths of the unknown, of non-music, of primordial sound. in the \"night\" boot, he takes inspiration from Ellen Fullman's drone music, with plucked and scratched metal strings. \"Migration\" sinks into isolationist gorgues with pale sounds and very fragile mechanical oscillations: a base of low frequencies, some spectral noise, a loop that fluctuates, the journey of the mind is assured. Still metals in \"Shoals\", in a continuum that awakens sleep before the disturbing deformities of \"Dusk Crossing\", a song in which we recognize distant Tuu influences and that approaches some slow-motion of the California synth school. A flute with an ethnic flavor appears in \"Snake Hymn\", a short song reminiscent of the old O'Yuki Conjugate and which ferries the listening to \"Underworld\", a sound abyss that traces the structure of the fantastic \"Tlaloc\" by Jorge Reyes and Francisco Lopez, although discarding the different conception of global sound, here much more 'full. \"Heart of Stone\" is the most esoteric piece of the CD and is made of sounds extracted from the manipulation of stones: 11 minutes of non-music of the highest level and sound inventions that set new standards of reference. The rarefactions of \"Etheric Memory\" are linked to the most 'surreal things generated by the space-ritualmusic of recent times, then \"Passage\" closes the album in perfect Hic Sunt Leones style: sound flaps of origin difficult to identify and surround sounds. A disk to be explored in depth, a new opening towards worlds awaiting our arrival.\n\nGianluigi Gasparetti / Deep Listenings",

      "about": "The Alberto Ezzu Lux Vocal Ensemble was born in 2001 to perform his own compositions and improvisations, mainly using harmonic chanting. In this latter work, the vocalists are inspired by the funeral texts of ancient Egypt, The Litans of Râ, to follow a vocal path Which crosses, in multiple forms, the various registers of male voices to describe the spell and the magic of harmonic singing. They sometimes accompany with small percussion instruments, shruti box and synthesizer. Every sound, in nature, is a complex event of pure sounds whose vibratory frequencies are mutually exclusive in mathematical / musical relationships. These sounds are called harmonic sounds. The techniques of the diphonian song allow to filter the harmonic content present in the timbre of the human voice and to produce, precisely, distinct sounds in a conscious and creative way by organizing true single-voice polyphonies.",

      "about": "'IMPERMANENCE' have his focus on Tibet, where Stefano Scala went for musical researches and recordings some years ago.\n\nThe magic of the cult and traditions of the country with high test peaks in the world accompany us in this journey,on a mountain pass, walking along the pathways of the rarefied Himalayan atmosphere, escorted by a convoy of mules or yaks. Sounds can be heard of the wind and rain, voices,songs and steps of nomads of Impermanence. \n\nAn album that displays different acoustic instruments,harmonic chant, percussions, flutes, rattles and bells, and field recordings.",

      "about": "An album properly realized for an the 'Arte Aborigena Australiana' exhibit, organized by Galleria Bolzani, Milano. Stefano Scala is a researcer and musician with a great experience in antropology and ethnic instruments collected all over the world.\n\n\n\nThe roots of music and the research of its ancestral origins are often the raison d'être for contemporary composers such as Stefano Scala. \"Il Tempo del Sogno\" is not born only from sound experimentation in the isolation of a recording studio but it is the result of distant journeys, concerts between natural sites and spiritual pilgrimages that the musician has undertaken across the borders of the world. The narrative breath of the work is affected in every passage of this inner tension from the vocal prologue, hovers between the notes and the ritual dances that weave the eight compositions gathered in the register. Pure divinatory experience that dispenses mantra on mantra to the sound of didjeridoo and flutes, drums and sideral synths that press through the circles of primordial vibration.\n\n( Rockerilla - Aldo Chimenti)",

      "about": "The music on this recording was created using photographs of 20 Polyphon discs.\n\n\n\nThe photographs were imported into i2sm which converts digital image files into music. It analyses the brightness, colour and saturation of pixels in the image and converts them into MIDI. The MIDI generated was then further adapted. Instrumentation, samples and incidental events were added and transformed for aesthetic and musical continuity.\n\n\n\nA Polyphon is a disc-playing music box, a mechanical device first manufactured by the Polyphon Musikwerke. Invented in 1870, full-scale production started around 1897 and continued into the early 1900s. More about the Polyphon can be read here -  en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphon\n\n\n\n IDIOPATHIC RENAISSANCE was released in 3 editions –\n\n\n\nI. DOWNLOAD \n\n\n\nII. DOWNLOAD + CDR: EDITION OF 30 COPIES: SOLD OUT\n\nProfessionally pressed CDR housed in hand-numbered printed sleeve. The CDR contains all the download tracks plus an extra track, '0170'. This track will not be available for download.\n\n\n\nIII. DOWNLOAD + 2 x CDR + ANTIQUE POLYPHON: EDITION OF 20 COPIES: SOLD OUT \n\nContains the CDR mentioned above plus a further CDR, a 40 minute remix of Symphonium Star Wheel which originally appeared on the 2009 album OUARDA (THE SUBTLE ART OF PHYLLORHODOMANCY). This bonus CDR will ONLY be available to customers who buy the Polyphon edition. \n\n\n\nThe package also includes an original Polyphon disc. The Polyphons are 39.5cm discs which will also play on a Regina Musical Box of the same size. They were made c.1900. The discs are in various conditions consistent with their age. No attempt has been made to clean the discs and their playability may be variable.\n\n\n\nFEBRUARY 2022 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "All the lyrics used on It's Only Pain were written by Liles' father, Michael Liles. They were discovered when clearing out his spare room after his death in 2017. The poetry was written sometime in the late 70's and has been given a life here.\n\n\n\nContributions come from: Matt Davies, Effie Nikolaou, Arwen Schiavone, Karin Park, Faust's Jean Hervé Peron, ex Mayhem frontman Maniac and Mared Lenny (the critically acclaimed Welsh singer known as Swci Boscawen).\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\n\nThe Quietus - Noel Gardner\n\n\n\nAndrew Liles, an important post-millennial part of the Nurse With Wound/Current 93 ‘family’, releases music at a fairly breathtaking rate, yet It’s Only Pain is described by label Dirter as his first “general release” since 2018. Never mind the taxonomy, clock the concept: all the LP’s lyrics were written by Liles’ father in the 1970s, discovered after his death, and are interpreted – often translated from English – by multiple guest vocalists. Many are already in the musician’s collaborative orbit, some are more surprising. My recollections of Mared Lenny’s late-00s music (frankly pedestrian Welsh language indiepop under the name Swci Boscawen) did not mark her as someone with a future appearing on NWW solo projects, yet here she is on opening song ‘Skid-Row Schizoid’, narrating bilingually over a song that’s a bit like if Van Der Graaf Generator had been an influence on Fourth World music.\n\n\n\nLiles’ taste for dramatic arrangements can border on kitsch but more often charms. Karin Park, synthpop soloist and Årabrot member, leans into her roles with terrific relish, initially reading over sawing strings and clanging piano on ‘A Thousand Minds’ before adopting an operatic register for ‘Beyond The Cosmos’ and ‘Humanist’. Faust’s Jean-Hervé Peron hams it up spiritedly over ‘Down The One Side’s stern gothic folk and ‘Bywyd Llonydd’ revels in its diverse guestlist: Matt Davies, owner of a Welsh record store and a fine ‘dramatic reading’ type voice; Maniac, ex of black metal originators Mayhem; and Awen Schiavone, author of a children’s book about a penguin named Pedro.",

      "about": "As my 50th year of existence ends I bring you COLOSSUS PART TWO. \n\n\n\nCOLOSSUS is an inconceivably massive project that consists of 50 tracks all of which are 50 minutes long. \n\n\n\nCOLOSSUS PART TWO completes this project.\n\n\n\nCOLOSSUS PART ONE consists of the first 25 tracks and is also available on this site.\n\n\n\nParts One and Two combined are just short of 42 hours of 'music'. \n\n\n\nThe 'songs' are extreme, simple, complex, mellow, angular and often surreal adaptations of every single hit from the last 50 years that was at Number One in the UK charts on my birthday. \n\n\n\nThe music is either in the same key or with the same notes played but in a different order, backwards or inverted. Further music and notation has been added by myself. They are absolutely nothing like the originals. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the words to the songs are formed from the lyrics to every Number One hit from the last 50 years. But with a twist. \n\n\n\nI have adapted the lyrics by using the William Burroughs cut up method and further changed them to make some kind of structure, but they remain predominantly abstract and nonsensical. \n\n\n\nMany thanks to all the narrators who are individually credited on the track titles. \n\n\n\nFurther thanks to all the listeners, detractors, strangers, friends, foes and all those that were cruel or kind that have faded in and out of my existence. You, in no small way have helped me create this monolith. \n\n\n\nAnother Happy Birthday to me - here's to 101. \n\n\n\nThis recording is numerologically accurate and anagrammatically active.\n\n\n\nMARCH 2019 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\n\nDANGEROUS MINDS\n\nAndrei Tarkovsky called his art “sculpting in time,” but Stalker has the brisk pace of a Tom and Jerry cartoon compared to Andrew Liles’ new mega-album Colossus, a 50 LP box set released in digital form. Liles specializes in improving things, and Colossus is bigger and better music. Not only is it superior to other new records, it is superior to the 50 years of pop history it digests. \n\n\n\nLast March, we premiered the first half of Liles’ audio monument to his half-century between heaven and earth: 50 tracks, 50 minutes each, one for every year since 1969. With the arrival of Part Two this month, the 42-hour opus is complete. It’s about three times the length of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen, 25 times as long as The Concert for Bangladesh, or 360 times the album version of “Total Eclipse of the Heart” (irrefragably scrambled in Part One).\n\n\n\nThe tracks, named after the songs that topped the chart on each of Liles’ birthdays, are original compositions distantly related to the number ones that inspired them—per Liles:\n\n\n\nThe music is either in the same key or with the same notes played but in a different order, backwards or inverted. Further music and notation has been added by myself. They are absolutely nothing like the originals.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the words to the songs are formed from the lyrics to every Number One hit from the last 50 years. But with a twist.\n\n\n\nI have adapted the lyrics by using the William Burroughs cut up method and further changed them to make some kind of structure, but they remain predominantly abstract and nonsensical.\n\n\n\nPart Two brings us from 1994, represented by Mariah Carey’s “Without You,” to the present, and it is here that Liles really shines, because the hits are so much worse. If you listen to the originals, Celine Dion’s abominable “My Heart Will Go On”—bad enough in 1997-‘98—sounds like a Bach concerto next to what came after: Madonna’s “American Pie,” Westlife’s “Uptown Girl,” Chico’s “It’s Chico Time.” But when pop goes low, Liles goes high. Colossus draws strength from the passage of time that saps and enfeebles the top ten, right through the irresistible one-two combination that closes the album. By the time Edward Ka-Spel of the Legendary Pink Dots performs “Shape of You,” named after Ed Sheeran’s 2017 hit, and David Tibet narrates “God’s Plan,” after Drake’s supermarket sweep of last year, you may imagine that pop music is Tom Skerritt’s character in Alien, cocooned and begging for death, and Colossus is the muscular, merciful Sigourney Weaver who sets him on fire.\n\n\n\nThere is a lesson here for despairing pop fans: dross can be transformed into solid gold! All you have to do to make an Ed Sheeran song listenable is remove all of Ed Sheeran’s contributions to it, find a better Edward to sing it, and radically rewrite the music and lyrics. Then set it on fire. You can keep the original title, no problem.",

      "about": "As I enter my 50th year of existence I bring you COLOSSUS.\n\n\n\nCOLOSSUS is an inconceivably massive project that consists of 50 tracks all of which are 50 minutes long. \n\n\n\nCOLOSSUS PART ONE consists of the first 25 tracks.\n\n\n\nCOLOSSUS PART TWO completes the project and will be available on 11th March 2019, my 50th Birthday.\n\n\n\nParts One and Two combined will be just short of 42 hours of 'music'. \n\n\n\nThe 'songs' are extreme, simple, complex, mellow, angular and often surreal adaptations of every single hit from the last 50 years that was at Number One in the UK charts on my birthday.\n\n\n\nThe music is either in the same key or with the same notes played but in a different order, backwards or inverted. Further music and notation has been added by myself. They are absolutely nothing like the originals.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the words to the songs are formed from the lyrics to every Number One hit from the last 50 years. But with a twist.\n\n\n\nI have adapted the lyrics by using the William Burroughs cut up method and further changed them to make some kind of structure, but they remain predominantly abstract and nonsensical.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to all the narrators who are individually credited on the track titles. \n\n\n\nFurther thanks to all the listeners, detractors, strangers, friends, foes and all those that were cruel or kind that have faded in and out of my existence. You, in no small way have helped me create this monolith. \n\n\n\nHappy Birthday to me - here's to 100.\n\n\n\nThis recording is numerologically accurate and anagrammatically active.\n\n\n\nMARCH 2018 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE\n\n\n\nREVIEWS\n\n\n\nWAS IST DAS\n\nAnyone can put out a huge output but it takes guts to maintain this high quality of hours. An epic digital box set.\n\n\n\nRead the full review here -  \n\nwww.wasistdas.co.uk/colossus.htm\n\n\n\n DANGEROUS MINDS\n\nColossus spans the sublime and the abject. There are passages of exquisite beauty, and there are parts that make your bowels cramp and your teeth hurt. \n\n\n\nRead the full review here -  dangerousminds.net/comments/colossus_andrew_liles_42_hour_opus_reimagines_50_years_of_pop_a_dm_premiere\n\n\n\n ECHOES AND DUST\n\nOne of the most important albums that will come out this year.\n\n\n\nRead the full review here -  \n\now.ly/hX3m30j8NeY\n\n\n\n THE QUIETUS\n\nIt’ll make you laugh. It’ll make you cry. It’ll change your life. Probably all three at once if you listen to Andrew Liles’ 25-hour-long Colossus Part One album... while on LSD.",

Desirable Napoleon wonder.\n\nYour age, you're parties.\nYou're in Moritz, go friend. You know your look.\nWhere do I do? On your painting can.\n\nGo realise Marie. Go inside.\nYou remember pearls? Men say you and you. \nYou, you. Both yes me. Your yes.\nGet in the rags. \n\nMarried loveliness, the care won't scar.\nStill you touched surround clothes. \nBoulevard summer, your ambition.\nAll off circles, Zizi jet.\nBut carefully children.\n\nWhen? Who got go? But Picasso is alone.\nVacation sip. Laugh.\nBody heard alone, a face. Streets rolling diamonds.\nHang inside, race topless.\nI look by where? Yes, surround your head.\nI to your you? Your they.\n\nWhere did you go?"

      "about": "This instalment in the Miscellany series brings together an array of aural oddities and childish experiments. It's an honest document - rough and raw.\n\n\n\nIn 1985 a trio of teenagers, myself, Alex Pergusey and Nathan Haynes, formed a band. We were, and will always be, ‘The Martyrs of Tragedy’, excerpts are included here.\n\n\n\nAlso in 1985 I formed my first ‘solo’ project – ‘Margaret’s Malignant Growth’. A number of tracks are included within.\n\n\n\nAlong with my ‘solo’ endeavours there was also ‘Gash’ a short lived (two day studio collaboration) with my friend Neil McLachlan. Two tracks were worth including here.\n\n\n\nA day of recording with Alex Pergusey gave me an hour long tape to explore, my findings can also be found on here.\n\n\n\nBefore there was Andrew Liles there was Lividity. Two cassettes were released by Lividity, one in 1987 and the other in 1993. The Lividity moniker was abandoned in 1996. Almost all of these recordings were conceived under the name Lividity.\n\n\n\nMost of these tracks are much longer in there original form. Some are challenging, others deserve more time and most of them are hissy.\n\n\n\nThis collection is the best of the worst and the worst of the best from the best of times and the worst of times. The past is a distant planet, but occasionally it’s pleasant to fly by.\n\n\n\nThis album was released in two editions \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD\n\n\n\nThe DOWNLOAD also includes (for the first time digitally) the 2009 vinyl box set MISCELLANY DELUXE (SOUVENIRS PERDUS D’ANTAN). \n\n\n\nDOWNLOAD and 4 CDR set: SOLD OUT\n\n\n\nThe CDR set includes 8 extra tracks that will not be available as download. It comprises of of 4 professionally pressed CDRs in full colour printed individual sleeves which are housed in a recycled card sleeve and envelope which are signed and numbered 1- 65.\n\n\n\nThere have been 6 releases in the Miscellany series so far. All the physical copies of these releases are now sold out but are available digitally using the links below.\n\n\n\nMISCELLANY - Double CD-R - 2002\n\nDownload here - \n\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\n\n\n\n MISCELLANY - DELUXE - 13 CD-R box set - 2003\n\nDownload here - \n\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-deluxe\n\n\n\n MISCELLANY DELUXE (SOUVENIRS PERDUS D’ANTAN) - 3 LP box set - 2009\n\nDownload here - \n\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995\n\n\n\n MISCELLANY - LUSSUOSO (ELECTRONICS: 1990 TO 2015) - 3 CD - 2015\n\nDownload here - \n\nwww.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-lussuoso-electronics-1990-to-2015/\n\n\n\n MISCELLANY: MYTHOLOGICAL MARTYRS AND MALIGNANT MEMOIRS (THE LOW FIDELITY LIVIDITY RECORDINGS: 1985-1995) - 4 CD-R - 2019\n\nDownload here -  www.andrewliles.com/discography/miscellany-mythological-martyrs-and-malignant-memoirs-the-low-fidelity-lividity-recordings-1985-1995/\n\n\n\n MISCELLANY: ADDENDUM (FRAGMENTS AND INCONSISTENCIES 1999 - 2013) - CD-R - 2023\n\nDownload here - \n\nandrewliles.bandcamp.com/album/miscellany-addendum-fragments-and-inconsistencies-1999-2013\n\n\n\n JUNE 2019 : DESCEND AND DISINTEGRATE",

      "about": "\"I look around and I feel the music of the dust, the pureness of the silent cleared from nothing.Even the darkness gives birth to sound. There are transparencies between sonorous textures.The air is the guilty.\"\n\n\n\n “Unprofaned Twilight”is the forth album by Aglaia. It is born from the previous works but, in comparison with them, it develops a wider breath directly from the background’s sounds. The composition is softer and more refined. Again the sonorous world that here is explored is that one of the enchantment, of the mild soundfading. An unprofaned and inviolate twilight, where the different vibrations are balanced, without any sort of tensions. Time rolls by and space too. The sound is a natural matter and gives birth to an intense crepuscolar light. Listening to this music is like to see thousands of fine luminous rays, filtered through half-closed windows. Adance of dust in a never ending movement that catches the light around.With aglaia’s sound we are in an electroacustic microcosm full ofvibrating signs.\n\nThe first of the two long compositions suggests a natural and quiet landscape. The sound’s mood isa sort of perpetual tinkling, wrapped up a voice coming from the space, that observes from afar. An armonic accordance between different reality.\n\nThe second, eventhough more intimate, is equally shining. Everything happens during a night where insects, spring-waters and moonlight match themselves together. As warming midnight with underworld lifes.",
