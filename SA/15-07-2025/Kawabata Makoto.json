      "about": "This is Tsurubami’s 1st cassette in 1995 (limited edition of 20).\n\n\n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994. \n\n\n\nThe three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT. The three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. \n\nAs long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission: According to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha? \n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours. \n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.",

      "about": "Andromelos were formed back in 2004 by Yamazaki Maso (electronics) aka.Masonna, Kawabata Makoto (guitar, organ), and Okano Futoshi (drums). They released their first self-titled album on the Finnish label Ektro Records in 2006. But since then, for all kinds of tedious reasons, the band have been unable to play even a single gig. But they were back as Andromelos2 in 2013, this time as the trio of Kawabata, Okano and Nakaya Koichi (electronics) from Nasca Car! They will release a new album \"Electric Reincarnation\" from the French label BamBalam Records in this November.\n\n\n\nThe original CD was released by Ektro Records in 2006.\n\nThis digital album was remastered and remade the artworks by Kawabata Makoto for Bandcamp.",

      "about": "Basement Echo is the historical meeting point of two generations of the Japanese underground. Kawabata Makoto, leader of The Acid Mothers Temple, and Michishita Shinsuke, leader of LSD March, are together here for the first time in a guitar duo. Though Kawabata and Michishita are from the same scene, the fact that they are from different generation means that they bring different energy to the collaborations. This fact is extremely exciting for Kawabata, who refers to Michishita as \"one of the most promising musicians in the Japanese Underground.\"\n\n\n\nBoth artists agree that Basement Echo was a step into the unknown with neither really knowing what the resulting sounds would be.\n\n\n\nFor Michishita the collaborations have been a dream come true. He describes Kawabata as having a \"soul of rock that never burns out.\" After the recordings were complete the two friends sat down and raised a triumphant toast. Recorded at Snowflake Sound in Sapporo in October of 2007. Totally improvised with no editing/overdubbing. Designed by Darryl Norsen.",

Their music is totally mixture of their solo sets, not like bored guitar free improvisation.\n\nThis is unreleased live recording in Kobe in Spring 2022.Ishihara Takeshi synchronizes light bulbs with his guitar sound on the stage, also he makes noise by holding a cable in his mouth.\n\n\n\nThis digital live album was released for only Bandcamp first, also released on limited CD by Acid Mothers Temple label in 2022.",

      "about": "GODMAN is:\n\nFormed in 2005 by Kawabata Makoto (Acid Mothers Temple), Higashi Hiroshi, Miyashita Keiichi (Mandog), Enomoto Takayuki, and Watanabe Yasuyuki. Released their first album \"GOD ∞ DOG\" on the Acid Mothers Temple Label. Subsequently, the band shifted away from a fixed line-up, becoming instead an ad hoc, sporadically active unit led by Kawabata and Miyashita.\n\nThe band's latest line-up features minimal trance guitar, mixed with jazzy passages, of Miyashita Keiichi, aka Mandog. Miyashita is a true wandering guitar bohemian who has enjoyed a deep relationship with Damo Suzuki ever since he played as lead guitarist on the 2002 US tour by Damo Suzuki's Network. Joint lead guitar is provided by Kawabata \"Guru\" Makoto, leader and guitarist of Acid Mothers Temple who enjoy intense popularity outside Japan. Kawabata's guitar work ranges from the explosively loud and ultra-high speed to the ecstacies of eternal guitar drone. On transcendent bass is Morita Kiyoshi, who played in bands like Reform in the late 1970s and released a record on the legendary Pinakotecha label, before moving to Tokyo to become a studio musician. When he returned to Kansai he has been hailed by the younger members of the underground scene as a senior statesman. On drums is the unique, genius-level talent of Satoshima NANI. Satoshima, hero of Kansai's Generation Z (do we even need to keep saying that?), leader of Bogulta, and member of Acid Mothers Temple, Psyche Bugyo, Omoide Hatoba, Amazon Saliva, Human Shower and many more.\n\nTogether the sounds they play become the wind, the earth, shooting stars... They roam wild and free across the span of the cosmos, scorching onwards endlessly towards to the ends of the universe. Ultimate cosmic trance psychedelic music!\n\nIn 2018, from this line-up came the first new album from the group in 13 years, \"Message from Nonmalt\"! \n\n\n\nThe original CD was released by Acid Mothers Temple label in 2018.",

Of corse this live recording is not including liquidbiupil’s OHP light show though, Kawabata played music with liquidbiupil as like live soundtrack. if there isn’t liquidbiupil’s light show, Kawabata’s music should be totally different, that’s why this credit should be Sky Shine, not Kawabata Makoto solo.\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.",

      "about": "MURA was an experimental rock band formed by Kawabata Makoto with some high school friends who had never involved with music or performance before. Their complete and utter musical amateurism allowed for a true flowering of the original creative impulse. Once that creative impulse began to ebb MURA split up, leaving behind four cassette and a single live performance.\n\nSince the performance were originally recorded on to 30 minute cassette tape.(except the 4th, which used a 46 min. cassette for some reason.)\n\n\n\nThe original cassette tape was released only a few copie by Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1981, then re-issued on a 12 CDR box set entitled “Kawabata Makoto Early Works 1978-1983 : Learning From The Past - R.E.P. Reissue Series Vol.2” in 2012.",

Kawabata's guitar-work moves from a roar to a whisper, a yell to a sob. Together they create truly outer cosmic hymns to love and inner cosmic odes: a PIKAMAKO Word that expands into the limitless reaches of space!\n\nThe duo was originally formed in 2007 and have played extensively in Japan. In 2011 they spent five weeks touring the US and their first album, \"OM Sweet Home : We Are Shining Stars From Darkside\" was released by the UK label Riot Season. Their second album \"Galaxilympics\" was released by the UK label Upset! The Rhythm, and toured Europe to celebrate in 2017. In 2020 they should have played at \"FIMAV (Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville)\", it was cancelled by covid19.",

      "about": "This is an unreleased live recording of GODMAN on \"Message From Nonmalt Japan Tour 2018\" in Osaka.\n\nAll music was totally improvised.\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nGODMAN is:\n\nFormed in 2005 by Kawabata Makoto (Acid Mothers Temple), Higashi Hiroshi, Miyashita Keiichi (Mandog), Enomoto Takayuki, and Watanabe Yasuyuki. Released their first album \"GOD ∞ DOG\" on the Acid Mothers Temple Label. Subsequently, the band shifted away from a fixed line-up, becoming instead an ad hoc, sporadically active unit led by Kawabata and Miyashita.\n\nThe band's latest line-up features minimal trance guitar, mixed with jazzy passages, of Miyashita Keiichi, aka Mandog. Miyashita is a true wandering guitar bohemian who has enjoyed a deep relationship with Damo Suzuki ever since he played as lead guitarist on the 2002 US tour by Damo Suzuki's Network. Joint lead guitar is provided by Kawabata \"Guru\" Makoto, leader and guitarist of Acid Mothers Temple who enjoy intense popularity outside Japan. Kawabata's guitar work ranges from the explosively loud and ultra-high speed to the ecstacies of eternal guitar drone. On transcendent bass is Morita Kiyoshi, who played in bands like Reform in the late 1970s and released a record on the legendary Pinakotecha label, before moving to Tokyo to become a studio musician. When he returned to Kansai he has been hailed by the younger members of the underground scene as a senior statesman. On drums is the unique, genius-level talent of Satoshima NANI. Satoshima, hero of Kansai's Generation Z (do we even need to keep saying that?), leader of Bogulta, and member of Acid Mothers Temple, Psyche Bugyo, Omoide Hatoba, Amazon Saliva, Human Shower and many more.\n\nTogether the sounds they play become the wind, the earth, shooting stars... They roam wild and free across the span of the cosmos, scorching onwards endlessly towards to the ends of the universe. Ultimate cosmic trance psychedelic music!\n\nIn 2018, from this line-up came the first new album from the group in 13 years, \"Message from Nonmalt\" and toured in Japan.",

      "about": "This cassette contained music that Kawabata composed for a play he had written called “Alice in Nakedland”.\n\nThe play was some erotic expressionist nonsense - sort of like “Alice in Wonderland” and “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” added together then divided by two. His script was used, but his music was rejected by the other stuff members.\n\n\n\nThe original cassette tape was released only a few copies on Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1980. then re-issued on a 10 CDR box set entitled “Makoto Kawabata early works 1978-1981” in 2000. (Afterward, this 10 CDR box was changed to the 11 CDR + 1CD box.) It was reissued on vinyl by Italian QBICO Records in 2003.",

      "about": "Ankoku Kakumei Kyodotai is Kawabata's first group that was formed in 1978. This is Kawabata's first studio recordings in his carrier. Ankoku Kakumei Kyodotai is just an initial impulse even there wasn't instruments like guitar, bass or drums. The original cassette tape was released only a few copies on Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1980, then re-issued on a 10 CDR box set entitled “Makoto Kawabata early works 1978-1981” in 2000. (Afterward, this 10 CDR box was changed to the 11 CDR + 1CD box.). This digital album was remastered by Kawabata Makoto only for Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nThe only studio recording by the first group Kawabata Makoto formed with two friends. Since Kawabata was at primary school he had loved Indian music, musique concrete, and the electronic music of Stockhausen etc. Then when he was 12 he discovered The Who, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin… if only there was something that combined hard rock with electronic music, he would dream to himself. That was the beginning.\n\nAt the time they didn’t own any instruments. The only thing they had was a synthesizer that they had borrowed from another friend. As a result, their first musical forays were played on that one synthesizer and some handmade percussion.\n\nThey laid down the basic tracks in the dark storeroom adjoining the science laboratory at their junior high school, under the light from a single red lightbulb. They used some of the beakers and instruments from the storeroom as their percussion, breaking several of them in the process. Needless to say, this episode got them into a heap of trouble later.",

      "about": "This is Tsurubami's 5th album. It was released on CD from Strange Attractors Audio House in 2003.\n\n\n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994.\n\n\n\nThe three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours.\n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.",

This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements.

And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours.\n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.\n\n\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.",

Kawabata's guitar-work moves from a roar to a whisper, a yell to a sob. Together they create truly outer cosmic hymns to love and inner cosmic odes: a PIKAMAKO Word that expands into the limitless reaches of space! \n\nThe duo was originally formed in 2007 and have played extensively in Japan. In 2011 they spent five weeks touring the US and their first album, \"OM Sweet Home : We Are Shining Stars From Darkside\" was released by the UK label Riot Season. Their second album \"Galaxilympics\" was released by the UK label Upset! The Rhythm, and toured Europe to celebrate in 2017. In 2020 they should have played at \"FIMAV (Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville)\", it was cancelled by covid19.",

      "about": "This is an unreleased live recording of Tsurubami.\n\n\n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994.\n\n\n\nThe three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours.\n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.\n\n\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.",

Reissue Series Vol.2” in 2012.\n\nThis is one of my “wannabe contemporary composition” works in my teens, performed on synthesizer using mainly electronic tones. Having been shown the light by Stockhausen, I developed a yearning for contemporary classical music, and that impulse lay behind my creation of these solo pieces. Early on, from 1978, I had already created some solo electronic pieces for synthesizer, but those early pieces foregrounded musicality. In a more strictly rock-based approach. In these later pieces, however, the concept became more important as I groped for tunes and vibrations that could have a direct, drug-like effect on the brain and consciousness.",

However, since we still had no way of knowing (and more importantly, any need to know) musical theory or how to play our instruments in a normal way, we played in a style completely of our own devising. In particular, because we had no idea about the proper tuning for guitar and bass, we devised our own tunings. It would be another four years before we leaned about regular tuning.\n\nWe played our first live gig around this time. We plugged straight into the amp had been provided and proceeded to improvised at maximum volume for just under an hour. Finally the amps caught fire and the other bands were unable to play - needless to say, our reception from the audience and promoter was not the most favorable! - Kawabata Makoto (2002)\n\n\n\nThe original cassette tape was released only a few copies on Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1980, then re-issued on a 10 CDR box set entitled “Makoto Kawabata early works 1978-1981” in 2000. (Afterward, this 10 CDR box was changed to the 11 CDR + 1CD box.) It was reissued on vinyl by Italian QBICO Records in 2003.",

That’s why his playing is unique.\n\nThis is a live recording at the memorial concert of Nishimura Tsuneo aka. Bancho who is a friend and a deep music fan. He came to Kawabata’s all concerts in Hikone and Kyoto, but he couldn’t listen Kawabata’s acoustic guitar solo, because acoustic guitar solo was started in Autumn 2020 when covid19 pandemic has happened, there was no chance to play around there.\n\nKawabata really wanted to get acoustic guitar solo listened before he passed away. So Kawabata dedicated this solo set to Bancho.\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.",

      "about": "In 1980, at the time Kawabata Makoto and his friends / members of Baroque Bordello felt some sympathy with punk spirit but they just couldn’t get on with the music. So this was their own attempt at creating punk rock. The original release was a 46 minute cassette. With 32 tracks on the A-side more on the B-side - total of 62 tracks!\n\nUnfortunately, virtually no one who heard our totally improvised take on punk understood what they were trying to do.\n\n\n\nThe original cassette tape was released only a few copies on Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1981, then re-issued on a 10 CDR box set entitled “Makoto Kawabata early works 1978-1981” in 2000. (Afterward, this 10 CDR box was changed to the 11 CDR + 1CD box.)",

(Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1982, then re-issued on a 12 CDR box set entitled “Kawabata Makoto Early Works 1978-1983 : Learning From The Past - R.E.P. Reissue Series Vol.2” in 2012.\n\nThis is one of my “wannabe contemporary composition” works in my teens, performed on synthesizer using mainly electronic tones. Having been shown the light by Stockhausen, I developed a yearning for contemporary classical music, and that impulse lay behind my creation of these solo pieces. Early on, from 1978, I had already created some solo electronic pieces for synthesizer, but those early pieces foregrounded musicality. In a more strictly rock-based approach. In these later pieces, however, the concept became more important as I groped for tunes and vibrations that could have a direct, drug-like effect on the brain and consciousness.",

He inspired by Japanese traditional music, Indonesian Gemelan, Indian music and Arabic music.\n\nWhen the female vocalist Kaoru joined in 1987, she wrote lyrics for some songs, and these titles were changed. \n\nKawabata plays all instruments, NO programing, NO sequencer.\n\nThis digital album was released only for Bandcamp.",

Released their first album \"GOD ∞ DOG\" on the Acid Mothers Temple Label. Subsequently, the band shifted away from a fixed line-up, becoming instead an ad hoc, sporadically active unit led by Kawabata and Miyashita.\n\nThe band's latest line-up features minimal trance guitar, mixed with jazzy passages, of Miyashita Keiichi, aka Mandog. Miyashita is a true wandering guitar bohemian who has enjoyed a deep relationship with Damo Suzuki ever since he played as lead guitarist on the 2002 US tour by Damo Suzuki's Network. Joint lead guitar is provided by Kawabata \"Guru\" Makoto, leader and guitarist of Acid Mothers Temple who enjoy intense popularity outside Japan. Kawabata's guitar work ranges from the explosively loud and ultra-high speed to the ecstacies of eternal guitar drone. On transcendent bass is Morita Kiyoshi, who played in bands like Reform in the late 1970s and released a record on the legendary Pinakotecha label, before moving to Tokyo to become a studio musician. When he returned to Kansai he has been hailed by the younger members of the underground scene as a senior statesman. On drums is the unique, genius-level talent of Satoshima NANI. Satoshima, hero of Kansai's Generation Z (do we even need to keep saying that?), leader of Bogulta, and member of Acid Mothers Temple, Psyche Bugyo, Omoide Hatoba, Amazon Saliva, Human Shower and many more.\n\nTogether the sounds they play become the wind, the earth, shooting stars... They roam wild and free across the span of the cosmos, scorching onwards endlessly towards to the ends of the universe. Ultimate cosmic trance psychedelic music!\n\nIn 2018, from this line-up came the first new album from the group in 13 years, \"Message from Nonmalt\" and toured in Japan.",

      "about": "This is Tsurubami’s studio live recording at KFJC in May 2003.\n\n\n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994. \n\n\n\nThe three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours.\n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.\n\n\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.",

Because We saw other bows! We didn't know we played \"bowed guitar\" each others before. Since then we have played many shows in Europe and Japan. Unfortunately our latest shows in May 2020 were cancelled by covid19. \n\n\n\nThe original CD was released by Prele in 2005. The 12 pages photo booked was included. (all photos by JF and Kawabata.)",

      "about": "Human Shower is a zero-dimensional, zero-rythmical, ultra-art duo created in 2007 by Acid Mothers Temple leader Kawabata Makoto and genius, weirdnik drummer Satoshima Nani. Satoshima was a founder member of Zuinoshin, one of the leading bands in the new Generation Z movement that appeared in Osaka around the start of the 21st century. He went on to Bogulta, and also got invited to play with leading Japanese underground bands like Omoide Hatoba and Amazon Saliva. \n\nIn performance the group are notorious for their improvised song structures, as well as their sublime and entirely improvised lyrics. Their performances, as you might expect from their ultra-art conceptual approach, go beyond the understanding of most humans and climax with the construction on-stage of massive, meaningless art objets.\n\nThey have been working on their first album for eleven years now and it still needs some work. But in a typically bold move they have decided to release an \"Outtakes\" CDR from that as yet unreleased first album.\n\nHuman Shower has done their chapter one in 2019, and the band is touring the page to start chapter two from 2020.\n\n\n\nSatoshima Nani has been the drummer with Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. since 2015. Also Kawabata and Satoshima formed another duo with the different concept \"NANI∞GURU\" in February 2018.\n\n\n\nThis digital album is included all tracks from the original CDR and unreleased 4 bonus tracks.\n\nAnd Kawabata remastered all tracks.\n\nit was released only for Bandcamp.",

      "about": "MURA was an experimental rock band formed by Kawabata Makoto with some high school friends who had never involved with music or performance before. Their complete and utter musical amateurism allowed for a true flowering of the original creative impulse. Once that creative impulse began to ebb MURA split up, leaving behind four cassette and a single live performance.\n\nSince the performance were originally recorded on to 30 minute cassette tape.(except the 4th, which used a 46 min. cassette for some reason.)\n\n\n\nThe original cassette tape was released only a few copie by Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1981, then re-issued on a 12 CDR box set entitled “Kawabata Makoto Early Works 1978-1983 : Learning From The Past - R.E.P. Reissue Series Vol.2” in 2012.",

      "about": "\"Cosmic Pigs vs Invisible Ameba Men\" was recorded in 1979 and 1980 at Horyuji Sound House and R.E.P. Studio (i.e. in Kawabata's room). At the time everyone in the group was in thrall to progressive rock, electronic music and musique concrete. Those obsessions led us to create a science-fiction story called \"Cosmic Pigs vs Invisible Ameba Men\" that within used as a theme for improvisation and effects manipulation. We thought we had come with a progressive rock masterpiece, but the only reaction from those who heard it was 'I don't get it'.\n\n\n\nThe story goes as follows. The Cosmic Pigs, who live on Planet Pigsty, awaken to a sense of self and they start a rebellion against their rulers, the Invisible Ameba Men. The rebellion is crushed by the appearance of the Giant Ameba deity, and its leaders are sent to the guillotine. The remaining Cosmic Pigs are enslaved, but thanks to the magical intercession of their savior, the Lord of the Cosmic Pigs, they acquire Diamond Eyes. The Invisible Ameba Men want the diamond eyes for themselves, so they slaughter the Cosmic Pigs until they are wiped out. However, once the Invisible Ameba Men have the diamond eyes, they lose the ability to become invisible and they in turn are attacked and exterminated by a new invader, the Mitochondrian.\n\n\n\nThe original release of this material was as a 90 minute cassette tape by R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1980, then re-issued on a 12 CDR box set entitled “Kawabata Makoto Early Works 1978-1983 : Learning From The Past - R.E.P. Reissue Series Vol.2” in 2012.",

      "about": "This is Tsurubami's 3rd album. It was released on limited CDR from Acid Mothers Temple label in 2001.\n\n\n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994. The three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours.\n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.",

      "about": "This is Tsurubami's 4th album. It was released on CD from Riot Season in 2003.\n\n\n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994. The three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours.\n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.",

(Afterward, this 10 CDR box was changed to the 11 CDR + 1CD box.)\n\n\n\nAs I played with my band Baroque Bordello, i also kept on experimenting with solo recordings. As the group broke new ground as \"awakened pop\", my solo work proceeded by a continual process of trial and error towards the unaffordable and undeniable idea of an \"absolute music\".",

From around this time, restarted to play gigs on a regular basis. We were aiming for a new kind of pop music, which christened \"Kakusei Pop 覚醒ポップ [awakened pop]\". The idea was to stimulate self-awareness through repetition.\n\nHowever, at that time punk / new wave / noise bands were dominated the scene, and because we looked the same but were different, our music were not appreciated at that time.",

Cosmic Rooster\n\n\n\nKawabata Makoto : direct touching of a resister\n\nrecorded at Acid Mothers Temple, Aug. 2001\n\n\n\nI came up with the idea for this track, consisting just of me touching a resister, when i appeared at Yamasaki Maso's (Masonna, Space Machine, etc.) \"Cosmic Electronic Music Festival\". The playing technique is as per the naming, with a little added echo. On this track i use a voyage Controlled Filter made by Oberheim Electronics Inc.\n\n\n\n2. Vinash Odrha\n\n\n\nKawabata Makoto : voice, all instruments\n\nrecorded at Acid Mothers Temple, 1994\n\n\n\nThis track was recorded in 1994 for my as yet unreleased first solo album. So far only one another track from these sessions has been released \"Bahai Darmha\", which appeared on a free CD \"Abus 43\" that came with the French magazine Abus Dangereux in Feb.1998. And other tracks that were recorded in 1993 were released as a digital album \"Yuga Hiku\" on Bandcamp in Sep. 2020.\n\n\n\n3. You Are All Of My Love\n\n\n\nKawabata Makoto : electric guitars\n\nrecorded at Acid Mothers Temple, Feb. 2002\n\n\n\nI thought that i would try recording myself just sitting around the house, fingerpicking on the guitar, not playing anything in particular. If I was able to play just for the person I love most, how happy that would make me.\n\n\n\n\n\nall music by Kawabata Makoto\n\nproduced, engineered and mixed by Kawabata Makoto",

      "about": "The original cassette tape was released only a few copies on Kawabata's R.E.P. (Revolutionary Extrication Project) in 1980, then re-issued on a 10 CDR box set entitled “Makoto Kawabata early works 1978-1981” in 2000. (Afterward, this 10 CDR box was changed to the 11 CDR + 1CD box.)\n\nIt was reissued on vinyl by Italian QBICO Records in 2002. \n\n\n\n\"Our first release after changing the name of the band from the Dark Revolutionary Collective to Baroque Bordello. With our concept of restoring the independence that music possesses in and of itself, we began composing and playing in an improvised idiom that refused to be tied to any pre-existing style. As the synthesizer was still the only instrument that we owned, we were forced to build the other instruments ourselves. The A-side of the tape was made up of performances on these homemade instruments. The B-side was an electronic soundtrack for aerobics, incorporating some doubtless Pink Floyd-inspired sound effects. There was also a piece for guitar and cable noise. Both sides sounded very weird” – Makoto Kawabata (2002)",

In May 2018 they made their live debut on a tour of Mexico, and subsequently played dates in Japan.\n\nThe group's sound combines the experimental with the ecstatic, the rigorous experimentalism of contemporary classical composition with the noise + prog rock. It is impossible to believe that their ultra high speed, ultra dense, ultra massive particle cloud of sound is made by just two people.\n\nThe group's second album \"VOVIVIZM episode 2\" has been released on the French label Bam Balam Records in May 2019. They toured in UK and Europe including an appearance at the Raw Power festival in London in May and June 2019. The group has released \"VOVIVIZM episode 1.5\" on cassette tape from UK label Swap Meat in May 2019.\n\nThey played in Peru in November 2019.\n\nThe group has released live album \"VOVIVIZM another episode\" on Bandcamp also limited CDR by themselves for Western Japan tour. They will tour in Western Japan in July 2020.\n\n\n\nKawabata Makoto: electric guitar, synthesizer\n\nSatoshima Nani: drums",

Kawabata's guitar-work moves from a roar to a whisper, a yell to a sob. Together they create truly outer cosmic hymns to love and inner cosmic odes: a PIKAMAKO Word that expands into the limitless reaches of space!\n\nThe duo was originally formed in 2007 and have played extensively in Japan. In 2011 they spent five weeks touring the US and their first album, \"OM Sweet Home : We Are Shining Stars From Darkside\" was released by the UK label Riot Season. Their second album \"Galaxilympics\" was released by the UK label Upset! The Rhythm, and toured Europe to celebrate in 2017. In 2020 they should have played at \"FIMAV (Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville)\", it was cancelled by covid19.",

      "about": "This live album is the latest release of NANI∞GURU for Bandcamp, also has been released on limited CDR for NANI∞GURU's Western Japan Tour in July 2020.\n\n\n\nNANI∞GURU is a hyper-experimental, psychedelic noise-prog duo, spontaneously formed in February 2018 by guitarist Kawabata Makoto and drummer Satoshima Nani from Acid Mothers Temple. \n\nTheir first album, \"VOVIVIZM\" was recorded immediately and released on CD by the Acid Mothers Temple in March 2018 in a limited edition of 300. In May 2018 they made their live debut on a tour of Mexico, and subsequently played dates in Japan.\n\nThe group's sound combines the experimental with the ecstatic, the rigorous experimentalism of contemporary classical composition with the noise + prog rock. It is impossible to believe that their ultra high speed, ultra dense, ultra massive particle cloud of sound is made by just two people.\n\nThe group's second album \"VOVIVIZM episode 2\" has been released on the French label Bam Balam Records in May 2019. They toured in UK and Europe including an appearance at the Raw Power festival in London in May and June 2019. The group has released \"VOVIVIZM episode 1.5\" on cassette tape from UK label Swap Meat in May 2019.\n\nThey played in Peru in November 2019.\n\nThe group has released live album \"VOVIVIZM another episode\" on Bandcamp also limited CDR by themselves for Western Japan tour. They will tour in Western Japan in July 2020.\n\n\n\nKawabata Makoto: electric guitar, synthesizer\n\nSatoshima Nani: drums",

Kawabata's guitar-work moves from a roar to a whisper, a yell to a sob. Together they create truly outer cosmic hymns to love and inner cosmic odes: a PIKAMAKO Word that expands into the limitless reaches of space!\n\nThe duo was originally formed in 2007 and have played extensively in Japan. In 2011 they spent five weeks touring the US and their first album, \"OM Sweet Home : We Are Shining Stars From Darkside\" was released by the UK label Riot Season. Their second album \"Galaxilympics\" was released by the UK label Upset! The Rhythm, and toured Europe to celebrate in 2017. In 2020 they should have played at \"FIMAV (Festival International de Musique Actuelle de Victoriaville)\", it was cancelled by covid19.",

      "about": "This is Tsurubami's 1st album. \n\n \n\nTsurubami was formed in 1994. The three of us ? me, Higashi and a female drummer called Nobuko Emi are like three bloodbrothers whose destinies have been bound together from a previous existence. This bond between us later developed into the “Soul Collective” ideal of AMT.\n\nThe three of us have been given a huge mission in life and as a result we’re like waves that come and go, tides that ebb and flow. As long as we three have life on this planet the group will continue to exist. Here’s a summary of our mission:\n\nAccording to the theory of Inyo Gogyo, everything that exists in the world can be expressed by Yin and Yang, the two principles. (even computers work in this way). Everything is created from Yin and Yang, and the interactions of the Five Elements - wood, fire, earth, metal, water. The workings of the universe can be understood through a knowledge of the Two Principles and Five Elements. The form of everything on Earth and in the heavens is created by Yin and Yang, while the workings of the world occur through the Five Elements. If we take it that sound is one particle of time, then the energy of sound flows from the deepest past into the far future. And that also suggests that the purpose of ritual and prayer is to recreate the energy that existed at the beginning of the cosmos. Rituals and prayer function to reawaken that which existed at the beginning, to open the doors of this world, and to make that energy flow once more. Through the holy sound of Ohm, can we glimpse the eternal, escape the constraints of time (past, present, and future), and come to meet the Buddha?\n\nFor us, Tsurubami is a place of eternal spiritual training, a place where everything must be laid bare. This band itself is the last and greatest stronghold of group existence. I see it as a place where we can experiment with a form of improvised playing based on paranormal communication which has existed since the time of the troubadours. \n\n\n\nTsurubami has taken a hiatus since the end of 2009.",
