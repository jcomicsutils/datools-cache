      "about": "Burning Ambulance Music is proud to announce Polarity, a collection of improvised but deeply considered duo encounters between tenor saxophonist Ivo Perelman and trumpeter Nate Wooley.\n\n\n\nPress quotes:\n\n“an absorbing and dynamic set of improvisations” — Jazziz \n\n“the sound of people figuring out what they can do together” — The Wire \n\n“articulate expressions of spontaneous communication” — DownBeat \n\n\n\nPerelman, a saxophonist, painter and jewelry designer, is as committed to the art and craft of improvisation as anyone alive. Over a 30-year career, he has released more than 100 CDs, building creative relationships with players from all corners of the free music world. His intensity and devotion to spontaneous music-making is virtually without equal, and he has developed a unique and highly recognizable language on the horn, while always remaining open to hearing what his bandmates have to say.\n\n\n\nWooley is an open-eared and innovative improviser, composer, and all-around creative spirit who has worked extensively with Anthony Braxton, John Zorn, Ingrid Laubrock, Ken Vandermark, and many others, and has built up a vast and fascinating discography of his own, encompassing everything from solo work to recordings and performances with groups of all sizes. \n\n\n\nThis is the fifth encounter between Perelman and Wooley, but their first duo recording. They played together with pianist Matthew Shipp on Philosopher’s Stone and with bassist Brandon Lopez and drummer Gerald Cleaver on Octagon, both released in 2017, and reunited for Strings 3 with violist Mat Maneri and Strings 4 with Maneri and Shipp, from 2019.\n\n\n\nThe ten pieces on Polarity are intimate and beautiful, yet also rigorous and challenging. As Jean-Michel Van Schouwburg writes in the liner notes, “The rewards of their improvising method, their sensitivity and skills are offering us constant variations and extensions of forms, feelings and sounds…Their duo was not planned, but responded to an existential need to create beauty and surprise.”",

      "about": "The best improvisers play their best when challenged the most. Ivo Perelman and Nate Wooley once again push each other to peak performances, and since their peaks are high, so is the level of improvisation. — S. Victor Aaron, Something Else!\n\n\n\nThroughout the recording, Perelman, and Wooley trade musical commentary, rather like two familiar comrades meeting up after a short time apart, each with something to say, and the other more than willing to listen and respond. — Sammy Stein, Free Jazz Blog\n\n\n\nRecorded in Brooklyn, New York, the second installment of tenor saxophonist Ivo Perelman and trumpeter Nate Wooley's Polarity sessions offers a series of reflective, sometimes ludic, conversations...A graceful lyricism gradually takes over, coloured by wavering pitches and warm susurrations. — Stewart Smith, The Wire",
