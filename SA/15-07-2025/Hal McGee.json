      "about": "a collaboration \n\nVisual artist Nonlocal Variable’s electronic sounds from the early 1980s mixed together with Hal McGee’s dictaphone recordings from June 2025. We offer these recordings with love and joy to you, our listeners. You complete the audio art by attentive listening!\n\n\n\nNonlocal Variable is a visual artist from the Pacific Northwest, part of the Cascadia Mail Art Alliance. Between 1975-77, he hosted live Avant Garde “new” music, often using tape loops running across a room between two reel-to-reel tape recorders. In the early ‘80s, he fooled around with instruments for personal pleasure. Playing stopped, and NLV focused on corresponding artists in the DIY cassette culture – which led him to join the Fluxus/Mail Art community. Decades later, the only recorded music left was a cassette of random electronic noodling on a 1981 Casiotone VL-TONE-VL-1 portable synthesizer, recorded on a Revox B-77 reel-to-reel recorder. He was inspired by Hal McGee’s latest electronic psychogeographic collaborations and thought it would be cool to see what they could put together.\n\n\n\nFrom June 24th through 30th 2025 Hal McGee collected more than 120 recordings on two Sony ICD PX-470 stereo digital dictaphones in Gainesville, Florida: the sounds of his daily life including his dog Stanley, neighbors and family members, and spoken words; as well as electronic sounds made with his Casio VL-Tone that he bought in 1983, Casio CT-S200 RD, circuit bent Casio SK-1, Stylophone CPM DS-2 analog synthesizer, and KQ Unotone and John Cage Prepared Piano iPhone apps\n\n— with the participation of Kestrel Sky, who played the Borderlands Granular iPad app in an impromptu jam with Hal on KQ Unotone in Ben’s car after lunch at Metro Diner.\n\n\n\nOn June 30th Hal mixed together Nonlocal Variable’s Casiotone recordings along with his own dictaphone recordings played back in random shuffle mode and created an audio assemblage blending together sounds from many different times and locations.",

      "about": "Collaboramigos sounds like four friends sitting together in a virtual audio-chatroom, sharing thoughts and poems, conversing, playing random recordings of the sounds of their daily lives, telling jokes and stories, singing pop songs, and jamming on instruments in a playful, improvisational, free-flowing sound collage.\n\n\n\nDuring the month of April 2025 Girls On Fire, Dylan Houser, Rafael González, and Hal McGee gathered recordings of various sounds. In early May they mixed their sounds together using a chance process.\n\n\n\nThe album is perhaps best experienced as a continuous one-hour piece, but we understand that in life there are many distractions & things to do - jobs, family responsibilities, the cat needs to be fed, the dog needs to be walked, meals need to be prepared, etc. - so we have indexed the recordings in four parts of roughly equal length. We encourage you to listen to this album while you are doing other things, if you want.\n\n\n\n*Girls On Fire (Leslie Singer) sound sources & devices\n\nSony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphone\n\nStaples Easy Button\n\nKeychain guitar\n\nCheap & Plastic pink keyboard\n\nBlack & White Monotron\n\nDesktop fire extinguisher\n\nClips from:\n\n- Narvon-Gainesville Time Capsule by Strattonpossum and Hal McGee\n\n- Lectures by Laura Cottingham\n\n- Featuring various sounds from the NYC subway and mean streets\n\n\n\n*Dylan Houser recorded their dang recordings with a SONY ICD-PX470 starting on the very first day of the month of April (a holiday of utter damnation).

The names of Hal McGee and Electronic Cottage were already iconic in the Cassette Culture Hall Of Fame (well there SHOULD be!) when I first got involved with the network at the onset of the nineties, so it's great to be able to make some small contribution towards the legend. It was an enormous pleasure (if a bit of a long haul!) putting the show and this album together, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I have. The original broadcast has now been archived online for your eternal pleasure, I'll put the link at the end.\n\nThanks for listening,\n\nMick Magic (May 2024)\n\n\n\nLinks;\n\nKOWS 92.5 FM -  kows92-5.org\n\n Dr. Magic's Audio Lab -  www.mickmagic.net\n\n Electronic Cottage -  www.electroniccottage.org\n\n The Show -  archive.org/details/kowsradiosummit/Radio+Summit+_Dr+Magic's+Audio+Lab_+5-4-24.mp3",

      "about": "The Bubblegum Variations consists of more than 350 recordings by Arvo Zylo and Hal McGee mixed together in a chance process assemblage.\n\n\n\nArvo Zylo’s notes for The Bubblegum Variations:\n\n— Hal McGee has been recording experimental music and noise since 1981. Arvo Zylo was born in 1981, and has been active since the year 2000. For this project, Arvo initially intended to contribute solely walkie talkie recordings of himself from 2014 and 2015; “Image streaming” in a free association, dream-like style. This audio has largely not been listened to by Arvo since shortly after it was recorded.\n\n— That single creative spark gave way to other ideas, which included harmonium & toy pipe organ (thanks to Jason Lazer), and also stems from rare, long out of print tapes, unreleased recordings sometimes dating back to 2001, various field recordings, and occasional attempts at singing.\n\n— Some of the recordings included a Yamaha RM1x Sequencer, a Casio SK-1 knock off called an “SS330”, some elements of the Korg Elektribe series, two Line6 Delay Pedals, a haunted BOSS Micro BR handheld recorder, a USB handheld recorder, a coronet, a belt sander, a sampler, a smart phone, and a laptop.\n\n— Thanks Hal for your friendship!\n\n\n\nHal McGee’s notes for The Bubblegum Variations:\n\n— I was quite happy in mid-May 2025 when Arvo proposed that we do a collaboration. I immediately started making recordings with two Sony ICD PX-470 stereo digital dictaphones, of sounds from my daily life, diaristic entries, my dog Stanley, my brother Mark McGee, circuit bent Casio SK-1, Stylophone CPM DS-2 analog synthesizer, KQ Unotone iPhone synth, Haltoid noise box, sounds from the Apartment Music 54 and May Squared Wave shows.\n\n— and with contributions by my friends Ben Keselowsky, Josh Tippery, Alex Smith, and Lenny Pearlman.\n\n— Most of all, thanks to Arvo Zylo for this opportunity to collaborate!\n\n\n\nHome-brewed CD-Rs of The Bubblegum Variations are available for sale and trade from Hal McGee —  haltapes@gmail.com",

      "about": "a chance-constructed assemblage of hundreds of everyday, found, electronic, junk, improvisational, and noise sounds\n\n\n\non February 7, 2025 W.A.Davison wrote to Hal:\n\n Hey, Hal! I read your article on the Electronic Cottage website and was reminded that you are on my list of recipients for this new album.\n\n W.A.Davison \"500\" is a collection of 500 samples and loops that can be listened to as an audio \"cut-up\" (play it in shuffle mode and it's a new album each time) or can be used in sound collages/compositions of your own. It marks the occasion of my 500th release as a musician/sound artist.\n\n\n\nHal replied to William:\n\n W.A.Davison \"500\" arrived perfectly configured to work well with my usual dictaphone assemblage method!\n\n I want to create a dictaphone assemblage album consisting of most of your 500 recordings mixed together with an equivalent amount of recordings by me.\n\n— I have four Sony ICD PX-470 stereo digital dictaphones, which record and playback 16-bit WAV files.\n\n— During the month of February I will make recordings of various & 'random' sounds onto two of the four dictaphones.\n\n— At the end of the month I will load your recordings onto two of the four dictaphones.\n\n— To create the assemblage I will connect all four dictaphones to a mini-mixer, recording directly into Audacity.\n\n— I will then simultaneously playback the recordings on all four dictaphones in Shuffle Mode, thus creating a four-layered sound collage, with no post-production or re-mixing... just 'as it happens'.\n\n— The four-layered sound collage will then be arbitrarily broken into tracks of roughly the same length.\n\n\n\n—————————————————————\n\n\n\nThe recordings included on W.A.Davison \"500\" span more than four decades, so any kind of comprehensive equipment list is out of the question. Instead, here is an off-the-top-of-my-head list of recording equipment, instruments, etc. that I have used at various times:\n\n\n\n- various homemade instruments (Three-String Electric Crutch, Nog Nister, The Nice Device, etc.)\n\n- Atari 1040 STe running Cubase midi sequencer\n\n- several Apple computers running Logic\n\n- numerous PCs running linux OS with free and open source software (Audacity, Ardour, LMMS, Carla, Bespoke, etc.)\n\n- Tascam Porta One four-track cassette recorder and Yamaha MT120 four-track cassette recorder\n\n- Fostex R8 8-track open reel tape recorder and several Sony open reel tape recorders\n\n- Soundcraft Spirit Folio 12/2 mixer\n\n- various drum kits, drums, and percussion instruments\n\n- various drum machines (Realistic Concertmate Electronic Accompaniment, Boss DR-55, Boss DR-110, Roland TR-505, Boss DR-550, etc.)\n\n- various electric and acoustic guitars and electric bass guitars\n\n- various hardware synthesizers (Yamaha CS-20M, Yamaha DX100, Korg Monotron series, etc.)\n\n- various software synthesizers (TAL Noisemaker, ZynAddSubFX, Cardinal, Dexed, etc.)\n\n- numerous cheap electronic keyboards (Casio, Realistic, Fisher-Price, etc.)\n\n- found objects\n\n- toys (musical or sound-producing)\n\n- various guitar effects pedals (Boss RC-20 Loopstation, Boss DM-2 delay, Boss RV-5 reverb, Ibanez Metal Charger, etc.)\n\n- various multi-effects processors (Zoom RFX-300, Korg Kaoss Pad, Roland SE-50, etc.)\n\n- Amdek PCK-100 Percussion Synthesizer (kit built)\n\n- Roland CP-40 pitch to midi converter\n\n- various (mostly cheap) microphones\n\n- various field recorders (Sony MZ-NF810 minidisc recorder, Zoom H1n, microcassette recorders, etc.)\n\n- Warblers (modified cassette recorders)\n\n- Nintendo DSi handheld game system\n\n- numerous cassette recorders and modified turntables and record players\n\n\n\n—————————————————————\n\n\n\nHal McGee’s sound sources and instruments\n\n recorded February 1st through 26th, 2025\n\n with two Sony ICD PX-470 stereo digital dictaphones\n\n\n\nsounds of my daily life\n\nspoken words\n\nmy dog Stanley\n\nneighbors and grocery store employees\n\nfamily (including my mom and her dog Bailey)\n\nsending postal mail\n\ncircuit bent Casio SK-1\n\nCasiotone CT-S200RD\n\nCasio VL-Tone\n\nCasio VA-10\n\nYamaha Reface YC mini-organ\n\nYamaha ReFace CS synth\n\nStylophone GEN X-1\n\nKorg Volca Keys\n\nKQ Unotone iPhone synth\n\ntwo string pink dumpster guitar\n\ntransparent plastic ukulele\n\nSquier Paranormal Cyclone electric guitar\n\nDanish butter cookies tin\n\nsounds of Action Research #243 (02-02-2025)\n\nand Squared Wave (02-12-25) shows\n\n\n\n—————————————————————\n\n\n\nNotes from W.A.Davison “500\":\n\n Five hundred samples and loops, randomly selected from the archives of The Recordists.\n\n A Disembraining Songs release, cat.# DIS-027, Jan. 23, 2025.\n\n\"500\" is not only a collection of five hundred samples and loops, it is also my 500th release as a musician/sound artist. Discounting any possibly forgotten early tracks, or releases that have flown under the radar, I have been keeping track of every appearance of W.A.Davison (or Songs of the New Erotics, Six Heads, The Bim Prongs, etc.) that has been officially released to the public over the past 40 years. The discography includes appearances of my work as a musician/improviser/composer/sound artist on vinyl records, compact discs, cassettes and, more recently, digital releases on various netlabels, Bandcamp, etc. It also includes any other form of publishing/broadcasting where my work is publicly accessible, such as film and video soundtracks and radio, television, and internet broadcasts and appearances, so long as the streams/downloads remain available online.\n\n The samples and loops in this collection were selected randomly from the Recordist archives (cassettes, CD-Rs, videotapes, minidiscs, DATs, etc.) between July 5th, 2024 and Jan. 23, 2025.\n\n You will notice quite wide variations in the quality of audio collected here. I make no apologies for that as it's in the nature of a decades-spanning audio archive. High-fidelity was not a criteria for selection and, in fact, there were no criteria for selection. The collection truly is random. The only rule I set for the project was that no sample would be more than a minute long. In some cases I did make some minimal adjustments to the samples to make them more listenable, but for the most part the collection is presented \"warts and all.\"\n\n The collection can be approached as a work of audio art. The tracks can be played in order as a kind of cut-up. Putting your audio player in shuffle mode creates a new work each time! (I would suggest removing the gap between tracks, if possible). Most tracks can also be played as loops, if you're into that sort of thing. The entire collection of 500 sound files makes for approximately 2.5 hours total listening time.

At the end of September we mixed the recordings together using an automated random chance shuffle procedure. COLLABORATORY is one continuous immersive audio assemblage, which we have divided into six parts for the listener’s convenience (the sixth part is available as a bonus track in the download).\n\n\n\nThe listener completes the audio assemblage through active listening. Your mind will find patterns in the chaos. Have fun trying to figure it out!\n\n\n\nRafael recorded these sounds with a Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphone:\n\nhis voice, Korg Monotron, guitar, trumpet, MiniFreak V software, microcassettes, reel-to-reel tape recorder, shortwave, mixer, various objects such as pieces of paper, plastic bags and field recordings, and sounds of his daily life.\n\n\n\nHal recorded these sounds with two Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphones:\n\nsounds of his daily life, co-workers, family, neighbors, his voice, circuit bent Casio SK-1, transparent plastic ukulele, two-string pink dumpster guitar, Casio CT-S200RD keyboard.

This included toys, small wind instruments, bird whistles, mini digital audio recorders and synths of all kinds as well as smartphones. It just needed to be a sound device that fits into a jacket or pants pocket. Effects pedals were allowed. Much thanks to all the wonderful artists who contributed to Rocket in My Pocket. A special thank you to Hal McGee for the encouragement, inspiration, and the publishing of this compilation. Enjoy! — Leslie Singer",

      "about": "Columbus Trip\n\nwas recorded July 20th through 23rd, 2023\n\nwith four Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphones\n\nin Columbus, Ohio and Gainesville, Florida\n\ndictaphone assemblage audio folk art\n\nfeaturing Chris Phinney, Jeff Chenault, and Jerry Kranitz\n\nwith the voices of Lisa Miralia and other attendees\n\nof the Cassette Culture Celebration on the 22nd.\n\n...and of course Stanley\n\nOn July 28th I mixed the recordings together using a random shuffle procedure, creating an audio assemblage in which you will hear audio events from many different times, spaces, and places. The continuous 72-minute audio assemblage is divided into four roughly equal parts for the listener’s convenience.\n\n\n\nThe listener completes the audio assemblage through active listening. If you have never heard this kind of audio art before and you find it bewildering, perhaps just think of it as four talk radio shows playing simultaneously on your car radio, or the aural sensations you might experience at a county fair or a circus, or maybe four films being simultaneously projected. Your mind will find patterns in the chaos. Have fun trying to figure it out!\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, July 20th 2023 I took an airplane flight from where I live in Gainesville, Florida to attend the Cassette Culture Celebration on Saturday, July 22nd, in Columbus, Ohio, which was curated and produced by Jeff Chenault, and by Alison Colman of The Fuse Factory.\n\n\n\nI met Chris Phinney at the Atlanta airport and we sat next to each other on the plane flight to Columbus. Jeff Chenault met us at the Columbus airport and took us back to his house, which would be our home for the next three days.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday at 5:00 PM the three of us traveled to John and Cathy Bennett's house, where we met Jerry Kranitz. This was a joyous time for all of us! Until that day Chris had never met Jeff, Jerry, John and Cathy. The six of us went to dinner at the nearby Iron Grill restaurant at 5295 North High Street. More hanging out and conversing with Cathy and John inside their art- and book-filled home followed.\n\n\n\nOn Friday Jerry picked Chris and me up at 6:00 AM and we traveled to the Stauf's coffeehouse at 1277 Grandview Avenue (where I had a triple macchiato to get sufficiently caffeinated for the exciting day ahead). After Stauf's Jerry, Chris and I went to Grand Day Cafe (1284 West 5th Avenue) for breakfast. Mid morning Jeff showed Chris and me the gear setup for our improvisational performances on Saturday, and we hung out in his amazing three basement rooms of records, tapes, art, cassette culture memorabilia, synthesizers, and exotica treasures. At 11:00 AM we met Jerry at El Vaquero Mexican restaurant at 3230 Olentangy River Road. After lunch we traveled to Columbus Performing Arts Center at 549 Franklin Avenue, to check out the space and gain technical setup info for the event on Saturday. Friday afternoon was fun-filled with a stop at the amazing Used Kids Records store at 2500 Summit Street, then a stop for coffee at Cup O Joe (2990 North High Street), and then back to Jeff's for more hangout time and listening to records. Late afternoon Jeff, Chris, and I ate dinner at Panini Opa Greek restaurant at 4799 Sawmill Road. At 7:00 PM they dropped me off at John and Cathy Bennett's house, and the three of us conversed for three hours about William S. Burroughs, fluxus, poetry, and our art life experiences.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday morning Jerry picked me up from the Bennetts' house and we drove to Jeff's house to pick up Chris for early morning coffee at Starbucks. At 9:30 AM we met at Jeff's house and we all traveled to Cultural Arts Center to pick up sound system gear for the big event. At about 11:00 we loaded in all of the gear and display materials. You will hear bits and pieces of conversations and miscellaneous sounds from CPAC during the Cassette Cultural Celebration. We met many great and enthusiastic and joyful people there that day, too many people to list here, including old friends and new (including Brian Callahan who traveled from Indianapolis to attend). Included are sounds from the numerous sound art performances, and the cassette culture panel discussion moderated by Jerry in which Jeff, Chris and I shared our experiences and insights about our experiences in the 1980s, and what cassette culture means today. My entire solo performance with a handheld Monotron Duo analog synthesizer can be heard in the mix. \n\n\n\nOther great moments on Saturday include our mid-show break excursion to Schmidt’s Sausage Haus German restaurant at 240 East Kossuth Street to pick up dinner. Back at CPAC several of us sat around a big long table and ate and conversed: Rob from Saginaw, Otho Thorn and Knox Mitchell from Michigan, Michael Thomas Jackson from North Carolina, Endwar, Lisa, Jeff, Chris, Jerry, and me.\n\n\n\nAny way, I could go on and on forever! Ample documentation on video and audio of the Cassette Culture Celebration will follow in the days and weeks to come!\n\n\n\nThese three days were some of the best times in my entire life, which I will cherish forever. I am grateful and thankful for the opportunities to bond with Chris, Jeff, Jerry, John, and Cathy, and to hang out with Lisa Miralia, Brian Callahan, Mike Jackson, Knox, Otho, Ron Daily, Endwar, Grey Tissue, and so many other nice people whose names I can't remember at the moment.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Jeff and Deb Chenault for their gracious hospitality, and for giving me such a nice and peaceful home to stay in while I was in Columbus. Big thanks also to Alison Colman for helping to organize the Cassette Culture Celebration with Jeff. Thanks to Ron Daily for live sound engineering at the fest. Also thanks to Rachel Rew Wagner for recording the entire event on video and audio.\n\n\n\nThank you thank you thank you to all of you. I love you all, everyone I met, new and old friends alike. I feel badly that I cannot remember the names of everybody I met. If we met and conversed and you read this, contact me with your name and I'll try to add you to the text above.\n\n\n\nPhotos on the front cover, starting top left and then clockwise:\n\n- Frau McGee and Herr Phinney at Schmidt’s Sausage Haus.

You will hear 444 recordings from various times and spaces during that 39 day period randomly shuffled together in four simultaneous layers. You will hear me talking, my dog Stanley, my co-workers, some but not all family members (Dad and Mom and their dog Bailey, and my brother), Trevor Luke, neighbors, the postal delivery lady. Also, I played these instruments: circuit bent Casio SK-1, two string pink dumpster guitar, transparent plastic ukulele, KQ Unotone iPhone synth, red Casio CT-S200 tablehooter with a handle. You will also hear my brother, Mark McGee, play percussion. Additional audio recordings by K.R. Seward and Gerardo Colin.\n\nI like to call this style of music or organized sound by the name \"dictaphone assemblage audio folk art\"!\n\nThanks to RRRafael Speedy Gonzálezszszsz and Leslie Singerrrrr for ideas and inspirations.\n\n\n\nI encourage you to do other things while you listen, such as cooking, cleaning, laundry, household chores, answering mail, working on your visual art, riding the bus or subway, taking a walk, etc.\n\n\n\nPlus if you feel like playing along and mixing in your own sounds, please by all means do so!\n\n\n\nPlease note that I have a potty mouth and that this album is peppered liberally with spicy language that is not suitable for job and family settings, and that I talk about some stuff that might make some people uncomfortable or just plain wonder WTF.\n\nIt’s my brain and my life that I am sharing with you!\n\n\n\nMail stuff to me! - send postcards, letters, tapes, CDs, records, collages, mail art, rubber stamp art, zines, chapbooks, gadgets, comix, drawings, stickers, poetry, paintings, etc and I will mail to you a homebrewed CDR of my homemade audio art in trade\n\nHal McGee\n\n4230 SW 20th Lane\n\nApt.

I feel an affinity for and kinship with the Mail Art community, and I feel strongly that the underground DIY music scene and Mail Art are interrelated. Both share the same roots, ideals and inspirations. Independence, Community, Cooperation and Internationalism.",

      "about": "Composed by Michael Thomas Jackson\n\nFebruary 4-18 2023, Studio Knexiho, Winston-Salem NC USA\n\n- an Electronic Cottage project\n\nThe composition “ONECx15” was realized through the exclusive participation of members belonging to the Electronic Cottage online music group. I had been invited by Hal McGee to curate a project for the site and solicited vocal and instrumental sound snippets (not to exceed 9 seconds) in the form of an open invitation to all members. Each respondent was in turn provided an original photograph from myself in lieu of a part in the overall score. The score itself uses traditional rhythmic notation for the gestures that serve as the generative material for most of the composition, and the sound material submitted by the participants take on the role of pitched material. The voicing was arranged in four parts as a sort of homage to the four-track tape recorder, an indispensable tool in my development as a musician. While members of the group will surely notice that their sounds have been edited somewhat, I did not process the material in any other way.\n\n—Michael Thomas Jackson\n\n- with the participation of:\n\nBryan Baker, Bert Vanden Berghe, Walter Campbell,\n\nOsvaldo Cibils, Robert Clark, Max Julian Eastman,\n\nRafael González, Hal Harmon, Dylan Houser,\n\nMaggie-Wynn Kingsford, Charlie Kramer, Steve Ladensack,\n\nAl Margolis, Hal McGee, Bill Northcott, Andy Ortmann,\n\nJeremiah Paddock, Jay Decosta Peele, Chris Phinney,\n\nPhil Rodrigues, Kevin Seward, Leslie Singer\n\n\n\nWhile “ONECx15” is intended to be listened to as a single continuous composition, it can be structurally broken down into six sections:\n\n\n\n1 Exposition (0-2:20)\n\n2 Variance (2:21-6:40)\n\n3 Kishterlude (6:41-7:22)\n\n4 Lancing Tropes (7:23-9:45)\n\n5 Earth Blues (9:46-12:46)\n\n6 Coda (12:47-13:42)",

As you will hear by listening to April 2022 Report, I was scheduled to perform with Cathy, Jeff, and John at that event, but Delta Airlines made that impossible through their incompetence. My three friends performed any way (and they dedicated their performance to me), which made me feel better about things! Thanks to Alison Colman and The Fuse Factory",

Maggie-Wynn brought some pocket-sized noisemakers with her and I recorded her playing them shortly after we met in the Enzian parking lot.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday evening, May 18th, while walking with my dog Stanley, I recorded an extemporaneous memoir of the events of Sunday the 15th.\n\nOn this May 15, 2022 dictaphone assemblage album you will hear my \"review\" of the day, mixed with sounds from the day itself.\n\n\n\nYou will also hear me playing my 2-string pink dumpster guitar, circuit bent Casio SK-1, and KQ Unotone iPhone synthesizer.\n\n\n\ndictaphone assemblage audio folk art",

Vocals and lyrics on that section are by Laura Cottingham.\n\n\n\nLeslie would also like to credit Oliver Harris, Simon Reynolds,\n\nStarship and The Residents' The Third Reich 'n Roll for lyrical inspiration.\n\n\n\nSounds were made with the help of the Korg Monotron, Monotron Duo and Delay, various Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators, the lil toy washing machine contact mic (by Lucy Bonk), Fender Squier guitar, Roland Cube amp, Behringer WASP synthesizer, Electro-Harmonix Black Russian Big Muff Pi fuzz pedal, $19 Felby microphone and Yamaha MG06 mixer.\n\n\n\nTracks recorded from January 2019 through July 4, 2021 with the help of a Sony microcassette recorder M-560V and two wonderful Sony ICD-PX470 digital recorders.\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Hal McGee for inviting me to do this split album with him and for being such an inspiration and guiding light.

Both have made unpredictable audio work on tape since the early ‘80s, and they’ve been friends and supporters of each other for nearly as long. For a new split release, Singer blends sound art with musical homage and parody. On the 28-minute “I Want to Bodysurf in Vomit,” she mixes absurd songs, repetitive beats and samples, and comically-timed references to pop music into a dizzying aural amusement park ride. McGee’s approach to audio is more documentarian. He often carries a microcassette recorder around with him, capturing environmental sounds and his own verbal musings. His piece “Super Action Microcassette Assemblage” is a vintage example of this self-created form, as he injects self-aware references to his own process into a voice-in-head pastiche of mysterious speech and noise.",

      "about": "December 2020 Report Personal Mix\n\ndictaphone assemblage audio folk art by Hal McGee\n\nfeaturing Dylan Houser\n\n\n\nI recorded sounds of my daily life in the month of December 2020 during the isolation of the COVID-19 era using two Sony ICD PX-470 stereo digital dictaphones: dream diaries, my dog Stanley (Lindsey Barkingham), neighbors, co-workers, family members, KQ Unotone iPhone synthesizer, circuit bent Casio RapMan, Yamaha Reface CS synth, 2-string pink dumpster guitar, street sounds, emergency vehicles, the hospital where I work, and Publix grocery store. I loaded these same sounds onto two additional Sony dictaphones and then assembled a mix of the four dictaphones playing back the sounds in random-shuffle mode through a Behringer mixer directly into Audacity, with very little tweaking by me during the on-the-fly mix.\n\n\n\nThis December 2020 Personal Mix audio album features my friend Dylan Houser who traveled from his home in Lakeland, Florida and visited me on Friday, December 11th. You can hear his voice, and him playing his KQ Unotone iPhone synth and my 2-string pink dumpster guitar prominently in the audio mix.\n\n\n\n///\n\nThe full title of the third track is \"Damaged Beatings - My War is Over (if you want it) - the Process of Weeding Out Who's Naughty or Nice\" by BARK FLAG. Assembled by Dylan Houser from dictaphone recordings that he made of him and me improvising on KQ Unotone iPhone synths, him playing my 2-string pink dumpster guitar, and Lindsey Barkingham barking.\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\n\nThis album is related to and consists of audio materials that were also used on December 2020 Report by Harold Schellinx and Hal McGee —  halmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/december-2020-report\n\n\n\n ---------\n\nYou can view a slideshow movie consisting of more than 900 photos and short video clips from December 2020 with an alternative dictaphone assemblage mix on YouTube —  youtu.be/O2HX1lH_QSs\n\n\n\n \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nHarold Schellinx has issued his mixes versions editions of our collaborative project of December 2020.

Baker\n\n \n\nSpoken word: Marilyn Baker, telling about the houses she grew up in.\n\n \n\nBryan Baker: Samples, electronics, Reaktor, Obsidian, Korg Wavestate, Schoenhut Toy Piano, Zoom H5N Recorder.\n\n\n\nMagic Bullet are Mick Magic & Skit Zoyd, who play and do stuff to; two telephones, a tractor, the Irish sea and its winds, two vacuum cleaners, a boiler, a steam iron, several running taps, a tumble dryer, a washing machine, two dehumidifiers, a dishwasher, a cooker hood, a kettle, a microwave, a fan oven, a wind-up gramophone, a fan, a television, 2 Solpadeine tablets dissolving in a beaker of water (*other painkillers are available!), an extractor fan, a shower, a WC, an electric toothbrush, a hairdryer, an electric shaver and its cleaning / charging station, ‘whistle lips’, a toy xylophone, a toy recorder, a battery operated guitar toy, a Peppa Pig trumpet toy, a paper shredder and a printer.\n\n\n\nI live in a house called Asgard in the village of Knott End-On-Sea in Lancashire, England, as does Skit, my partner in the band. But we do not live in the same house, his is somewhere beyond several trans-dimensional voids in a parallel reality. We are told by an ageing scientist that there are 25 such parallel dimensions, and in one of these, our house is occupied by an American writer of some repute. This is the story of his visit to our Asgard, and how the portal device he brought with him allowed us to look back through in to his. And he did not just wish to see our house, he also wished to hear it. What else could we say but “Mi casa, su casa”...\n\n\n\nThe Hostess is played by Samantha Magic\n\nUnscheduled guest appearances by Twizzle Magic\n\nAnd our very special guest as The Traveller: Owen Knight\n\nAll tracks conceived and realised by Magic & Zoyd\n\nRecorded and mixed in The Mmatterialisation Chamber, September 2020\n\nPublished by Mmatterial, all rights reserved, but we don’t bite fingers\n\nMagic Bullet track artwork by Mick Magic\n\nCover art ‘Skit, Bryan & Mick’ by Kev Trundley  (connyplankton.bandcamp.com)\n\n Background, additional artwork and layout by Mick Magic\n\nFor further info:  www.mickmagic.net",

      "about": "EC Split 21\n\nby Thomas Milovac and Massimo Magee\n\nan Electronic Cottage release\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nMurals (for Maxo Vanka)\n\nThomas Milovac - Double Bass, Voice \n\nRecorded in Orlando, FL 10/2020\n\n\n\n“Murals” is a solo improvisation for double bass and voice influenced by the work of Croatian-American painter Maxo Vanka. Vanka’s striking murals at the St. Nicholas Croatian church in Millvale, Pennsylvania juxtapose elements of traditional Croatian life, religious imagery, industrialization, and the horrors of war that lingered in the minds of people after the end of the First World War. One example of this juxtaposition is a mural, at the St. Nicholas church, of a Nun ominously veiled with a gas mask over her face. “Murals” aims to explore the juxtaposition of musical ideas in a manner influenced by Vanka’s work and create a vast, sonic mural for the listener.\n\n\n\n/////////\n\nWelcome to the Real World\n\nMassimo Magee - clarinet, virtual piano\n\nRecorded at home in London 15th August 2020\n\n\n\nI've called the piece 'Welcome to the Real World' because it progressively strips back the layers of the constructed fantasy playing environment I've made for myself during this locked down year until it gets to just the raw zoom-recorded sounds of my clarinet in the studio with the noise of cars going by and people walking past etc, before putting back on the layers of make-believe for a finale. The clarinet part is a solo improvisation, recorded in my studio in one take and with no edits but with concert hall reverb later applied to most of it, and then there are also virtual piano intro and outro parts derived from the clarinet playing and interacting with it. My clarinet's a 1953 Selmer centered tone, so I like to imagine this constructed piano-clarinet duo in a non-existent hall is more what it might have been used to during its heyday in the 50s or 60s, with a gradual waking up to the realities of a musician alone in a locked-down 2020, competing with the noises of a world outside that probably doesn't care much for it in the main.",

They were made in pairs, using what they call the 'intersection principle', a working method that resulted in these 2 x 12 highly personal compositions, all in the respective authors very own style, that, however, pairwise have a 'melodic' overlap -their intersection- and the exact same duration.\n\n\n\nThink of these intersections as the spines of a species of two-winged creatures, where each wing corresponds to one of the two corresponding pieces. But as the creature may flap and fold its wings, there is, as a consequence a third dimension: you may collapse each pair into a third one, the mix or union of the two ...\n\n\n\nFor more information see the pdf file that comes with the digital download, or visit  harsmedia.com/SoundBlog/Archief/00858.php",

      "about": "EC Split 23\n\nby Ben Presto and Jeremiah Paddock\n\nan Electronic Cottage release\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\nBen Presto\n\n(tracks 1-6)\n\n\n\nJeremiah and I, after throwing down a series of brainstorming ideas for the EC Split Album, agreed on the theme that it would be good for both of us, and we came to the \"journey\".\n\nBut what do we mean by \"journey\" (voyage, trip, etc.)? The naked and raw meaning/sign or the metaphor of it?\n\nIt made me think of all sorts of journeys, of the vastness of knowledge... of everything except a vacation!\n\nFrom the voyage with psychotropic substances to death, from nightmare to infinite silence, from physical escape from one place to another (better? worse?) to that of a book, or a film, or a music album.\n\nMany ideas have been suggested to me by the films. I could have pulled out an album of at least 2 hours!\n\nSo I made (unrecognizable!) plunderphonics, fishing with full hands from every source of sounds/ideas.\n\nIn the titles (as in the cover) there are tributes to \"The Trip\" by Corman, to \"Dead Man\" by Jarmusch, to \"The 7th Voyage of Sinbad\", to \"The Twilight Zone\", to Wenders, to Carpenter, to library music as well as darker prog and electronics.\n\nMore obscure I said, because the whole thing seems to sound very gloomy, but, I swear, I did a great search to get there to an aural, synaesthetic experience.\n\nI hope I did my best!\n\n\n\n/////////\n\nJeremiah Paddock\n\n(tracks 7-22)\n\n\n\nPatrizio and I talked about journeys as being a theme or idea for the split. My physical ability to make exciting or long journeys was dramatically shortened by a disease. With the advent of COVID my work schedule changed and I was sent to work at a different location. The new location was 20 minutes from my home and on the drive there was a traffic circle that I drove through everyday, twice a day. I was not in a great place mentally and felt trapped in my own endless roundabout. More and more time was spent trying to map my mental journeys. I began composing guitar loops in the morning before work, trying to put some of these feelings into music. Depending on the day I really think you are able to hear my mood and state of mind.",

      "about": "EC SPLIT 8\n\nby Rafael González and Zebra Mu\n\n\n\nRafael González:\n\nCassettes, microcassettes, and their respective recorders, radio, shortwave, radio manipulated, Korg Monotron, Korg Monotron Delay, distortion pedals, Alexis Microverb 4, Mbira, toy guitar, school metallophone, and broken electronic game. Recorded August 2020 with Sony ICD PX-470 stereo digital dictaphone.\n\n\n\nZebra Mu is Michael Ridge.\n\nSound sources: various portable cassette recorders, answering machine message tape, tape loops, field recordings, contact microphone, junk metal, garage door and springs. The tape loops were recorded and assembled between 14 August – 23 August 2020, with the final composition being recorded in one take. Made with no FX pedals or digital processing. \n\n\n\nmridge.bandcamp.com\n\n  michaelridge.wordpress.com\n\n  quaggacurious.wordpress.com\n\n\n\n ---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nEC Split 8 features group members Rafael González and Zebra Mu (aka Michael Ridge). I’ve heard very little of Rafael’s work and none of Michael’s, so I’m pleased to get acquainted with their work. The two make a good pairing, both creating sound collages, though both are very different from one another.\n\n\n\nRafael’s first track is a cut-up collage of static, tones, and radio/television samples. I like the way he deftly slices and dices, setting a steadily flowing ‘groove’ with static, music and voices. It’s a nifty balance between frenetic chaos and Collage ‘n’ Roll. About halfway through things get briefly spacey before transitioning to frequently shifting sequences… a noise blast here, a flurry of voices there, flying saucer and ghostly effects, water drippy gurgly effects. Lots going on! The next track is similar but more hyper herky-jerky, with cut-up collage channel surfing and more of that noise and samples ‘groove’. I found my head bopping at times to what I’ll be darned ‘feels’ like a beat! But oh, that shrill piercing electronic cricket at the end!\n\nAfter a lightning quick voice manipulation, we’re treated to a glom of what sounds like crackling paper, static waves, string manipulations, toy instruments, alien oscillations, and voices. ‘Microcassette (I Need A Compass)’ is Rafael’s final track and my favorite of his set. It’s a fun collage of Japanese and other language voices and singing, plus lots of radio. It’s humorous, artfully/imaginatively collaged, and the result is like one big psychedelic sound-art brain sloshing.\n\n\n\nZebra Mu’s ‘side’ is a single 30-minute piece titled ‘Answering Machine Messages For John And Junk Metal Tape Loops’. An underlying drugged, wavering, looped ‘song’… it sounds like a misty blend of rock songs… provides the anchor for a succession of answering machine voices. If this is Michael’s answering machine, he gets some interestingly incidental calls. There’s also an ongoing flurry of what sounds like backwards effects that feel like knives being hurled lightning fast. The overall sensation is simultaneously spectral and lysergic. It’s fairly low-key for a while but near the halfway mark the volume and intensity level kicks up dramatically, until we find ourselves in the midst of a high-octane collage battle of metal, clatter, scrapes and scratches. Similar to Rafael, Michael also creates of sense of chaotic rhythmic flow, as if the cast of the stage show Rent got into a rumble in a Cuisinart.\n\nLOTS from both artists for the attentive listener to wrap their heads around!",

      "about": "EC SPLIT 9\n\nAl Margolis and not half\n\n\n\nAl Margolis: percussion/objects, alto and tenor saxophones\n\n\n\nnot half is Al Conroy\n\nWaldorf Microwave XT synth, Logic Pro 9, location recordings; Hecla Island, my furnace and Basil (1993-2014), summer rain in Winnipeg.\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nEC Split 9 features EC Group members Al Margolis and not half (aka Al Conroy).\n\n\n\nI have experienced Al Margolis in live performance and his two contributions to this set immediately brought to mind how he created his sounds during those shows. I recall Al stretched belly down straight out on the floor, putting his entire body into play as he took his quietly developing sounds where they needed to go. Putting those images out of my mind for a moment, I’m hearing on the 12-minute ‘al4haldrums’ what sounds like the slow moan of creaking doors, seamlessly interspersed with crackling waves, and even identifiable percussion taps, and near the end of the piece it’s almost like percussive, crackly, scratchy water flowing. Al quietly and subtly scratches, drags, tickles, and in various other ways manipulates the percussion, saxophones, and ‘objects’ in his employ.\n\n\n\nThe nearly 18-minute ‘al4halvoices’ is relatively action packed, creating a similar flow, but with a breathy, drawn out saxophone blow. And by ‘breathy’ I mean you can hear the sax but the sound is more blow/breathe based. The sounds vary and combined with weird whiney voicings, at times sound like a fly buzzing around a solo sax player who is stuck between short wave radio stations. At times it gets a little symphonic, with the fly becoming a swarm, though overall the sax manipulations and voices quietly flow and evolve, with the focus throughout being on SOUND. And all throughout the images of Al performing his sounds kept popping back into my head. (He was scheduled to perform here again this past April but, y’know…)\n\n\n\nAl Conroy’s work is new to me and his contribution, titled ‘winsomeness’, is a single nearly 30-minute piece. Field recordings of a gently flowing stream set the pace for a haunting electronic soundtrack. The music starts off with a Residents Mark Of The Mole vibe, though with a wavering psychedelic edge. I like the way the music develops, from eerily supernatural to spaced out contemplative. But the music is a multi-themed soundtrack, the stream being the only constant. The music finishes, only to shortly after start again with a more eerily sinister theme. Yet another new theme consists of spaced out synth waves, raising the volume and intensity level, that are simultaneously ominous and meditatively moody. Kudos to Al for captivating thematic development throughout!",

      "about": "EC Split 13\n\nby C. Mehrl Bennett / Faserhaft\n\nan Electronic Cottage release\n\n\n\nC. Mehrl Bennett\n\nIn August Company\n\n\n\nAll tracks originally recorded in August 2020 \n\n\n\nVarious instruments used include a harmonica, kalimba, windchimes, the flexing of stiff plastic packaging, a stick striking wood or bowl bell, and a Roland RD-500 keyboard. Sonic Pi software was coded for audio chords in Asemic Letters, and the tree frog audio in In Front of Him was freely provided by Dr. James P. Bennett of Madison WI, USA. Mixing software sold by NCH is MixPad/ WavePad which provided copyright-free cow moo, desk bell, and clock ticking samples, plus a voice synthesizer. Ambient sounds recorded from my home include an August rain storm, bluejays, a car driving over steel plates, and a land-line telephone.\n\n\n\nInspirations: environmental sounds, Hugo Ball's dadaist sound poetry, asemic letters which synchronicity caused to arrive on the same August day from MaryAnne in the UK and from Rafael González in Spain. Many thanks to Hal McGee at Electronic Cottage for providing the opportunity & impetus to produce these tracks, and to Judith Pauly-Bender for being my \"August Company\", and especially to John Also Bennett for his expertise in creating the final audio master.\n\n\n\n/////////\n\n\n\nFaserhaft\n\nHausgeräusche: Loss of time 2020\n\n\n\n\"Loss of time 2020\" is a critical sound on the lockdown situation, from my point of view a world social lumbago.\n\nThe story of raw sounds is on the one hand a parable with a preliminary certificate (Track No. 19). On the other hand the little audio sketch is a chapter of my (lifelong) notebook. It is kept without third persons and is not a beauty contest. Opportunity, coincidence and time budget determine the form. So it turned out that here some sounds to my visual notes were allowed to become a mosaic stone in the EC-Split-Project 2020! \n\nI would like to thank the Electronic Cottage group, namely Hal McGee, the initiator of this inspiring audio project, for this quite unlikely opportunity to participate, Rafael González for pointing the way to this wonderful \"EC experience space\", my split partner Catherine Bennett for her patience towards my pronounced obstinacy.\n\nInstruments and techniques? Every verse is different, all spontaneously and intuitively created. The protagonist is a kitchen alarm clock that called me to my human-physiological lumbago gymnastics in August 2020! Otherwise: a microphone, a karaoke tool for children, breath and voice, a 40-year-old \"Korg-Taktell\" (which broke during the recording), an ether, a monotron, a pipe, a monoloque. Everything is homemade, produced alone and (!) without any ambition to be artificial. This also applies to the improvised recordings of the tracks (8 out of 10 tracks only with a cell phone).\n\nFaserhaft Oktober 2020\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nEC Split 13 features EC group members Catherine Mehrl Bennett and Judith Pauly-Bender (Faserhaft) in “August Company” with one another. Both artists employ a fun array of objects, voices, electronics and sundry sonics!\n\n\n\nThe voice is the star of the show on Catherine’s tracks. And it’s well supported by her ‘gear’, including harmonica, kalimba, windchimes, ‘the flexing of stiff plastic packaging’ (how cool is that?!!), a stick striking wood or bowl bell, and Roland RD-500 keyboard.\n\n\n\nI got a sense of fun right out of the chute with ‘Many Hats’, which features computer voice dada and moo cow sound poetry. The computer and Catherine’s voice, both ‘straight’ and manipulated are heard on ‘An Audio Book’. Other tracks include dada swami recitation and song, Catherine reciting to a gently rolling stream, Catherine reciting to a combination of chimes and crackling, ‘breathy’, chant, and other voice manipulated song/reciting to kalimba, and more. I like the combination of poetry, drone chorus of electronic crickets, rumbling and harmonica on ‘In Front Of Him’. ‘August Piano Synth’ is different, being a delightful solo piano melody. I really like the sound of the piano synth. But my favorite is Catherine’s last track, ‘Two Asemic Letters’, on which she reads her interpretation of letters she received. The voice delivery is like a dada Native American/Klingon dialect, which sounds especially cool when the keyboard melody joins in. I love the vocalizations/pronunciations and, recalling John M. Bennett’s voice work on EC Split 2, I wonder if the two have ever done duos?\n\n\n\nThe best part of having linked up with Judith on Facebook is the wonderful art she creates and posts. Her art really brightens up my work from home days. So it’s a pleasure being treated to her audio work. It begins with the rhythm of a ticking clock and pan percussion. Judith titles her set ‘Loss of time 2020’, which she describes as “a critical sound on the lockdown situation”. It all feels very delicate, but then POW!… now it’s pure party time chaos on ‘Perpetual’, the beats provided by what sounds like a grooving rat-a-tat typewriter, plus a rickety chorus of percussion, musical swarm, and voice samples (some slowed down to drugged pace). The sensation is of an audio art office party.\n\n\n\nA sense of fun alternates with meditations on the passage of time. There are electronic buzzing and chirping pieces, but then we’re taken back to the quiet clock rhythm, as if to make us keenly aware of TIME. We’ve got toy melodies, whirring electronics and collages of voices, plus whimsically jamming video game rock ‘n’ roll. I like the mildly frenzied tinkling alien synth melody on ‘Exit 1’. I got down with the zany electronic jamming funk of ‘Moods’. ‘Schore’ is by far the longest of Judith’s tracks and my favorite. I love the quirky, rickety, yet grooving upbeat electronic jazz vibe, the cool synth sound, and the jerky cymbal like rhythms that propel the music. A fun set. File under Cool & Strange!",

      "about": "EC Split 6\n\nby Mental Anguish and Vasectomy Party\n\n\n\nMental Anguish — Desire, Tethered, Strapped\n\nrecorded sometime in the dog days of August.\n\nGear: Surge & Lokomotive vst analog synths controlled by M-Audio Oxygen 8 & MicroBrute analog synthesizer, Behringer mixer, using Behringer controller, heavily effected with delay, reverb, & compressor\n\nInspired by way too many old artists from all over the world back in the day & my EC comrades in arms, also my grandbaby Little Man - Cameron Fleetwood McNamee\n\nThanks to Hal McGee, Hal Harmon, Jerry Kranitz, Carl (Cuz) Howard, Doug Walker, Jeff Central & all the members of Electronic Cottage\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nVasectomy Party — Models of Misdirection I, II, and III\n\nInspired by time spent recently in the Smoky Mountains. Environmental decay and detritus channelled through sound. Meditation through drone, loops, and glitch. \n\nRecorded in the waning days of August 2020. \n\nGear used (as much as I can recall):\n\nKalimba\n\nIbanez 7 string guitar\n\nChain Mail Glove\n\nCopper Scouring Pad\n\nCrank Sturgeon Plug Ugly Contact Mic\n\nField Recording kayaking in Lake Junaluska, NC \n\nKorg Kaoss Pad\n\nDOD Gonkulator\n\nBoss DD-7\n\nHotone Reverb\n\n\n\nThanks to Chris Phinney, Hal McGee, and the Electronic Cottage Community.\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nEC Split 6 features EC group members Mental Anguish (aka Chris Phinney) and Vasectomy Party (aka Hal Harmon).\n\n\n\nI have heard a lot of current Mental Anguish music and much of it is characterized by an ambience that I can only describe as ‘glacial’. It’s a piercing effect that injects an eerie feel to the soundscapes Chris sculpts. Opening track ‘Desire’ creates the sensation of being alone on some dark, frigid, extraterrestrial tundra. The sense of isolation in a freezing windswept environment is stark. And howling effects suggest that wherever we are is haunted by unfriendlies! ‘Tethered’ is like the next chapter in whatever tale has already begun to unfold. But the intensity level is higher, with the glacial effects starting to get eardrum piercing, and the wind rushing at a deadly gale force. I pity the poor sap who is battling both the elements and alien demons. But there may be a happy ending because ‘Strapped’, while clearly in the same setting, adds a lightly flowing, hypnotically cosmic melody that seems to offer sanctuary from the threat. I love the competing moods and emotions on this track. Can you tell this is seriously image inducing?!! Great soundtrack to inspire the fun stuff that my brain conjures up!\n\n\n\nChris and Hal prove to be great candidates to share a split because Vasectomy Party’s tracks create a world that is complimentary yet different from Mental Anguish. Far from the isolation of the Mental Anguish world, across three tracks Vasectomy Party slings hordes of alien life streaming across his sonic canvas. There might be a war going on during ‘Models Of Misdirection I’, with all the aggressive rumbling, the clash of harsh electronic swords, and what at times sounds like a space-rock power-electronics assault. During relatively quieter moments we hear bubbling and gurgling that feels like water flowing through a cave, yet there’s still loads of activity with the alien effects flying. ‘Models Of Misdirection II’ consists of a quieter yet menacing atmosphere, with layers of drones and rumbling soundscapes, and chattering robot insects bleeping and buzzing about. ‘Models Of Misdirection III’ includes some of the busily quietest moments of the Vasectomy Party set, yet nonetheless zig-zags between deep space violence and Frankenstein lab going force alien electronic. Hal has the same flair that Chris does for world creation and stimulating my imagination to visualize what he’s pumping into my brain!",

      "about": "EC Split 11\n\nby Walter Wright and Michael Thomas Jackson\n\nan Electronic Cottage release\n\n\n\n/////////\n\n\n\nWalter Wright\n\n\n\n1. Surface Tension (30:00)\n\nBoard Weevil, contact mics, objects, AVSynth\n\n\n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\n\n\nMichael Thomas Jackson\n\n\n\n2. Brained By Errant Plastic (3rd ) – completed September 19 2020 14:33)\n\n\n\n This work-in-progress was conceived of, and recorded during, the month of January 2017. The idea is that the fundamental material be subjected to a sort of generational degradation by means of processing, media transfer, amplified performance, or any combination thereof. This material was culled from phonograph and compact disk sources with no regard for copyright infringement (and I offer no apologies to the Marshfilm Enterprises, Inc., as their apparent opinions on labor, drug use, and ‘getting off on the right foot’ differ wildly from mine).\n\n The first performance was the following month at the Winston-Salem, NC, USA, venue Test Pattern. It was a lively and rather crowded venue, which prompted me to perform the material at the maximum volume that was allowed (I was using the ‘house’ sound system). Split into two stereo tracks, the material was subjected to live independent waveform clipping and various editing/mixing techniques that degraded the material and hopefully made for an enjoyable listening experience. It is never my intention to antagonize anyone (unless, you know…).\n\n For the current version, I am using as a mix template a digital image provided to me by Walter Wright. Something about this image is evocative of this work that I otherwise have not even thought about in over three years. There’s no distortion this time around and that basic material should be a bit more comprehensible which hopefully conveys a certain ridiculousness about consumer culture. I have a difficult time conveying my political beliefs through what seems to be abstract music, but believe me this is the most wretched and disturbing that my native country (USA) has been in my lifetime of 50 years; and I thought that in the mid-late 1980s as well. Plastic to me is, at least symbolically, anti-everything. Avoid it. Fight it. Love in spite of it! It is our medium.\n\n\n\n3. Play misty For Me – completed September 28 2020 (04:05)\n\n\n\n Misty pastels…pinks…purples…plunderphonics. Two turntables & a microphone. Quotidian ear pollution. If you don’t like the effects, don’t produce the cause…and no one gives a fuck that you like pina coladas or screwing on the beach. Do not stop until you get enough music into gold. Is Walter right?\n\n (a SKOWEYAJEED production)\n\n\n\n4. 8136 – completed September 26 2020 (11:06)\n\n\n\n On the first anniversary of the passing of Ann Mallett comes this study of an interval in various settings from just a few voices. A slightly flatted major third (almost just?) intoned by human voice, B flat clarinet and two synthesizers combine with the incidental noise of home at Knexiho Studio in Winston-Salem, NC, USA, and the location near Reynolda Gardens where her ashes were scattered in the same city.\n\n It was more than a privilege to live with and help care for Ann. Even as her dementia grew worse, we could still find topics about which to laugh and ridicule, as she loathed the last president elect of her lifetime and my cooking is often mediocre. She adored her great-grandson and at least most of our pets. She wasn’t crazy about my music, but was fascinated by my clarinet practicing and how I laid out manuscript paper all over the dining room table in between meals.\n\n Every culture has a third of some shape close to this one; it’s the calling home…it’s comfort I suppose. I’ve used it horizontally for decades, so here I’ve decided to employ it vertically and yes very sloppily, keeping the environmental sounds as relevant and the microtonal nuances as I do.\n\n To help organize the various recordings I consulted the I-Wright-Ching using only Walter-sided coins. It is dedicated to Ann’s direct descendants Geni, Kathleen and Jackson. Love.\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nWalter Wright uses Board Weevil, contact mics, objects, and AVSynth to create his single 30-minute piece titled ‘Surface Tension’. (I had to Google Board Weevil to learn that it’s a cool little device for making fun sounds.)\n\n\n\nThroughout ‘Surface Tension’ Walter scratches, scrapes and clangs, creating a noisy yet ambient, freeform yet seamless flow. I like the parts where scraping, breathy percussion combines with quirky electronic effects. There’s also a segment where a horn-like melody meanders lazily, along with occasional electronic blasts and feedback, anchored by energetic scraping percussion. It feels like noisy audio-art meets free-jazz. Other parts get more spacey, screechy and frenetically intense, as the glom of scraping noisy percussion creates a kind of scampering rhythmic flow. And there are backwards or looped sounding effects that inject a disorienting psychedelic vibe. I like it.\n\n\n\nI am well acquainted with Michael Thomas Jackson’s resume. Mike provides detailed notes for each of his three tracks, which I urge you to read while listening on the Bandcamp page.\n\n\n\n‘Brained By Errant Plastic’ started life as a live performance in 2017. It’s a busy collage of samples taken from, as Mike explains, “phonograph and compact disk sources with no regards to copyright infringement” (atta boy Mike!!!). Various voice samples are played at normal, chipmunk speeds, and everywhere in between, with a musical accompaniment of damaged string melody and other electronic embellishment. It’s like an acid trip in overdrive listening to a dozen news programs simultaneously, few of which are communicating much of anything, and gets pretty crazy/fun/humorous. It’s a darn good collage work and has the same sense of seamless flow that I experienced with Walter’s track.\n\n\n\nOn ‘Play Misty for Me’ Mike gets even more gnarly with the tape speeds, and the voices and music are made considerably more delirious by some precision cut-up work. (I don’t like pina coladas either Mike so if we ever meet up, IPAs on me!)\n\n\n\n‘8136’ is deeply personal, inspired by the loss of a loved one, and is different from Mike’s first two tracks. It much more stripped down and sparse, being mostly quiet and with minimal activity. We hear droney chant singing (normal speed), synth and clarinet notes, miscellaneous sounds… like Mike’s own ode to the departed.\n\n\n\nAnother strategic EC Split pairing!",

AND it’s gets reeeeally freaky experimental-psychedelic at times!\n\n\n\nWe start off with an amusing collage of language instruction samples, accompanied by Asian inspired flute ensemble and howling bells. It got me giggling as I recalled the silly language instruction tapes I used to listen to at school. ‘Tech Lesson’ features whirring electronics, birds chirping, harmonica, robot speak, and a collage crowd of instructional voice samples, all glommed together in a sometimes carnivalesque atmosphere. I love the varying moods and general sci-fi soundtrack vibe of ‘All Thru The Night’. It has a cold, mechanical feel at first, soon becoming lightly menacing, but then a pleasant melody is introduced along with lightly chanting vocals, and is peppered throughout with whimsical effects. On the one hand simple yet LOTS going on! ‘Old Spirits Melt Into Thin Air’ features more contrasting bits of backwards and efx’d voice samples, haunting atmospherics, and a frenetically grooving bongo rhythmic pulse, which is all so Psych-E-DEL-ic!!\n\n‘Patchy Fog’ is one of the more purely musical tracks, ranging from dreamily spaced-out electro dance, various tasty little melodies, and an acoustic blues-folk vocal number. The oddball contrasts come with the weather report samples, fuzzy static effects, dissonant strings, and soundscapey vibes. It reminds me of Pink Floyd’s ‘Alan’s Psychedelic Breakfast’!! ‘Gone’ feels like a continuation, with its tripped out backwards effects, church bells, and creepy voice narration. Hats off to Ken for good FUN collage craftsmanship!\n\n\n\nJack Seiei’s set is a series of ‘KEN’ titles. It kicks off with a scratchy, choppity, echo’d tribal tin can percussion dirge. It’s got a great groove, in a stumbling through the toxic wasteland kind of way. ‘KEN3’ lays down a hup-tup-3-4 percussion march, propelled by light but doomy bass riffage, shimmering string action, and various clanks and clunks, creating a strangely rhythmic blend of sound-art and avant-punk. But somewhere after the halfway mark it goes quiet and Jack is laser focused on a hushed, ambient scraping pulse. This let my guard down… and then BANG!!!... ‘KEN5’ clobbers my cranium with its noise efx’d industrial and Frankenstein lab electrodes assault. ‘KEN6’ blends a chorus of chattering Italian voice samples with more electrode / percussive machine shop aggression. ‘KEN7’ thrusts us into an eerie industrial land of lost souls, with its anguished demonic voices, ghostly howls, and spaced-out supernatural soundscapes. And ‘KENX’ is similar to the opening track, finishing the set with what I’ll call experimental Scratch-Rock, doing all kinds of fun mangled things to string instruments and percussion. Another solid pairing of EC group members!",

It is joyous and strange and funny and sad and chaotic and puzzling and imperfect and a little bit noisy. It is filled with LIFE. It is difficult in some ways, and not necessarily \"politically correct\". We are living in odd times and SaLLL is a reflection of these odd and challenging times. In my opinion the best art encourages us to be empathetic, patient, loving, courageous, and joyous.\n\n\n\nThe spirits of dada, fluxus, cassette culture, mail art, and experimentalism can be found fully alive and breathing within Sounds and Looks Like Life.

      "about": "May 2020 Report is a 65-minute assemblage of sounds from my daily life in Gainesville, Florida during the Coronavirus Era.\n\n— with contributions by Leslie Singer, Stanley, Rafael González, Lumen K, Dylan Houser, Mark McGee (drum sounds), and other friends.\n\n\n\nThe assemblage is split into four sections, and it includes spoken words, me playing the KQ Unotone iPhone synthesizer and 2-string pink dumpster guitar, family members, neighbors, co-workers, grocery store employees, rainstorms, birds, dogs, helicopters, airplanes, traffic sounds, etc.\n\n\n\nI used four Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphones to make these recordings, and you will hear the sounds I recorded with them mixed by random chance procedures in an audio assemblage along with sounds from the video clips from the May 2020 movie, which you can view here —  youtu.be/UD-PeBdT2Us.",

I like the strange blend of edgy ambience and video game soundtrack intensity. ‘House Of Hell’ is similar but with the sensation of being on some isolated beach with waves washing on the shore, as electronic pulsating crickets whiz by, and colored by weird robot voices and jarring blasts of electronica. I love the way ‘Skull’ swivels between and blends dreamy ambience with more quirky electronica, with an acid rock injection from guitar, and bits of tension from a periodic, brief heartbeat rhythmic throb. ‘Demented’ is like an off-kilter, high octane, drum centered free-jazz jam for the electronica set. ‘Terror Eyes highlights an electronica enhanced dreamworld, with a delirious blend of ripping guitar leads, misty atmosphere, flying saucer effects, and lost souls singing. ‘Black Widow’ is a similarly wigged out glom of psychedelic electronica and creatively mixed collage fun. And ‘Inside Out’ is a lightly musical style of sci-fi and meteorological ambience and effects. Good stuff, I really enjoyed this.\n\n\n\nNext up is Austin ‘Mini-Mutations’ Rich’s spoken word story titled ‘May The Circle Be Unbroken’. Austin tells the tale reading aloud with himself as narrator and all the character parts. And what is it? A murder haunted house sci-fi mystery! There were occasional light sound effects up at first once the body is found things get interesting as Austin adds a cool musical soundtrack and fun creepy effects. Now it’s more of a one-man radio play. Some of my favorite soundtrack music is on the ‘The Cellar’ chapter, with its eerily deep space melodic electronica. I wasn’t expecting a ‘play’, so this was a refreshing twist!\n\n\n\nCDs available from Austin Rich",

      "about": "EC SPLIT 5\n\nblems with Boss?\n\nby {AN} Eel and KR Seward\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\n{AN} Eel\n\nCantos & Various Vices:\n\n\n\nI was happy to find out about the EC Split project and happy to find it was with KR Seward - Two occasions which are new & agreeable to me ~! So as these things often do, the idea of Cantos & Vices emerged from the fog to form a skeleton or framework to dash along with - I created this with the intention of having a single long track, but life had other plans - I'm pleased to feature on this effort with KR & Want to thank them & Hal for considering me for this project - \n\n\n\nPROGRAM NOTES : This audio was created entirely using Audacity & was influenced to an unusual, perhaps even excessive degree, with the saliva of birds, which is why it's so darned sticky. I'd like to thank the ANTIFA & Opponents of Tyranny in their efforts as well.\n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\nKR Seward\n\nFork Spleed Bender:\n\n\n\nCreated by KR Seward late July-early August 2020 in Two Bays At The Moon and New Bern Cavern (each a provisional annex of the TaseSpime Confabulatory) and the Home Office Khasmatron (intracranial central control & sand barren substrate for the TSC).\n\n\n\nFeedback, sundry noises from oven grill, human vocal tract, Monotron, toy echo mic, also RISCy, GliderVerb, ADelay2 etc on padlike gizmo, smphn stuff, Audacity and so on. Some improper and/or repitched recording, playback etc. \n\n\n\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\n\n\n\nCover image — {AN} Eel \n\nArt Direction — {AN} Eel & KR Seward \n\nCover — KR Seward & {AN} Eel\n\n\n\n---------\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nEC Split 5 brings together {AN} Eel (sometimes known as Neal D. Retke) and KR Seward. Part of the fun of writing about these Splits is getting introduced to the work of fellow EC group members and this is my first exposure to both artists.\n\n\n\n{AN} Eel’s ‘side’ is titled Cantos & Various Vices. I was especially eager to dive in when I read in the Program Notes that the recordings were influenced, “perhaps to an excessive degree, with the saliva of birds”. My kind of artist!!\n\nNeal’s varied vocalizations give his recordings their distinct character. ‘Canto 6’ is a short opener that begins as a percussion rumination with a brief voice effect finale, hinting at things to come. ‘On The Eve Of Culthbert’s Special Porridge Feast’ (awesome title!!) features a playful kazoo or fuzzed oboe like melody, that later sounds like it might be electronic, or perhaps treated instruments, or both?! Whatever it is it’s a great sound. But we’re also treated to a vocal combination of merry but devotional la-dee-da singing and strange vocalizations that remind me of John M. Bennett’s voice fun on EC Split 2.\n\nI like Neal’s crazed yet merry singing/chanting/howling style on ‘Canto 7’, sung to the atmospheric twang of some jawharpy string strumming. ‘The Belgian Foot Thing’ includes a fun, zany, jazzy, gurgling organ jam, and what sounds like Neal’s take on scat singing, which is soon joined by rattling clatter percussion. ‘Canto Of Lake And Fire’ is by far the longest of Neal’s tracks and is like a more fleshed out version of ‘Canto 6’, with his quietly sparse percussion and singing that sounds like a cross between shaman chant and drunken sailor. But it’s contemplative, in a strangely chaotic way… What sounds like a toy piano soon joins in and cheerfully jams as the percussion continues its ambient exploration and the various offbeat vocal styles and breathy effects chime in. ‘Double Stash Iterations’ is the first time we hear actual words, being a cool collage of multi-layered spoken word phrases. And ‘Canto 8’ wraps up {AN} Eel’s set with merrily ethereal chant singing and a ghostly cat howling that’s the coolest voice effect of the set.\n\n\n\nKR Seward’s ‘side’ is titled Fork Spleed Bender and kicks off with ‘X-325’, a rumbly, droney, minimal meditation embellished with lightly whirring and buzzing electronics, plus spaced out mechanical and grating effects. ‘Out Kew’ conjures up images of hovering flying saucers, and the sensation is variously like being inside and outside the vessels. It feels like one big continuous drift and fade among the image of the saucers in space and meandering aimlessly in some alternate dimension. Really cool alien soundtrack and soundscapes piece. This theme continues in a more abandoned but active engine room direction on ‘Gorbin Quarterspeed’, with its laboratory electricity and layers of incessantly rumbling drones and soundscapes. I really like the blend of outer space and hallucinatory spectral world vibes. \n\nFinally, ‘Ell Arr Won’ shocked me out of my reverie with its high volume and high-pitched symphony of semi-melodic squalls, making for a terrific mixture of music, noise, and intensity.",

      "about": "EC SPLIT 3\n\nby Dylan Houser and NorthWoods\n\n\n\nDylan Houser’s side was recorded from August 8th - 10th, 2020. \n\n\n\nInstruments used: bass guitar, tablehooter, BOSS looper, Ibanez DE7 delay, ZOOM B2\n\n\n\nTHANKS: Jeff Elertsen, Colette Parisa, Bobby Clock (R.I.P.), and of course, to Charlie Kramer, Hal McGee, and the rest of the EC CREW\n\n\n\nThe bagel still won’t stop screaming... \n\n\n\ndhouser.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n ---------\n\n\n\nNorthWoods is Charlie Kramer creating noise and music from computer code, busted guitars, and old or homebrew electronics. All tracks recorded during August 2020, using ChucK code to process live audio, manipulate samples and field recordings, randomize sounds, and torment oscillators. \n\n\n\nHome page:  www.northwoodselectro.com  (includes a link to the Github page with ChucK code). \n\n\n\nMany thanks to Hal and Dylan! Also thanks to my family who tolerate many hours of me with my headphones on, as well as occasional blasts of industrial noise when I accidentally divide something by zero.\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz of EC Split 3 by Dylan Houser & NorthWoods:\n\n\n\nI haven’t heard much of Dylan Houser’s work and was pleasantly surprised by the lo-fi psychedelic ambient-noise-doom that characterizes his ‘side’ of this Split. I like how the bass on ‘Carnival Of Rigid Smiles’ lays down fuzzed doomy rocking riffage as atmospheric notes weave a droning, feedback laden path. ‘Erratic Warrior’ is all mood and atmosphere focused, creating a pleasantly haunted ambient-doom soundtrack with a rickety/spectral rhythmic pulse, marked by crashing and echoing bass chords. Spooky stuff. Cool crackling, string mangled finale too. ‘The Village Idiot Of Tomorrow’ takes a thematic turn, starting off as a swinging doom rocker, but soon starts to crank out sinister, psychedelic soundscape licks as a repetitive doom bass groove keep things rocking. Finally, we have the high intensity, ambient-noise chaos of ‘Freaks Eternal’. A barely discernible bass pattern provides the rhythmic pulse for this noise-psych soundscape excursion. Cascading waves of eerily dreamy fuzz and a light sense of melody create a psychedelic hell ride that is simultaneously meditative and harsh. Overall, kind of like Sunn O))) for the experimental set.\n\n\n\nI was very interested in Charlie ‘NorthWoods’ Kramer’s set after reading in the credits how he is “creating noise and music from computer code, busted guitars, and old or homebrew electronics.” Sure enough, it is the most basic of homebrewed sounds that make for the fun and charm of Charlie’s set. ‘LiveKitchen’ sounds like percussion played in a huge cavern with the resulting rolling and fading echoes. ‘Game’ is similar but mechanically jazzier, ultimately locking into a hectic machine shop deluge. ‘Wait’ features ambient static pulses that dance across the left and right channel, alternating between airy dance grooves and ambient drift. I like the toy like electronic grooves that are both martial and helter-skelter on ‘120BPM’, which is also colored by a pleasantly reflective bell melody. I love the Mario Bros meets ambient noise in an industrial robot dance club on ‘Dancemetal’. ‘Disco’ feels like pogo stick dance club electronica peppered with, and eventually overcome by whirly swirling oscillations. ‘Smiled’ is both action-packed and sedate, with its sci-fi minimalism, effects turmoil, and electro grooves. I like the shortwave voices from another dimension on ‘Vmail’. ‘Reach2’ sounds like an electro psychedelic carnival collage. And ‘Porch’ is an edgy, ambient breezy finale. Lots of fun sounds!",

      "about": "EC SPLIT 2\n\nby John M. Bennett and Bret Hart\n\nan Electronic Cottage release\n\n\n\n1.\n\nJohn M. Bennett reads from Ojijete\n\n\n\nJohn M. Bennett, reading from his 2020 book, OJIJETE,\n\nLuna Bisonte Prods. \n\nRecording by C. Mehrl Bennett.\n\n\n\n2.\n\nBret Hart — Two-Thirds Dead Already\n\nEbow, guitar, radio-samples, bass, percussion\n\n\n\n---------\n\n\n\nReview by author Jerry Kranitz:\n\n\n\nEC Split 2 brings together poet and sound maker John M. Bennett and the man of a thousand sounds and instruments (not all of them recognizable) Bret Hart.\n\n\n\nJohn’s contribution consists of him reading from his 2020 published book, OJIJETE. I love the combination of John’s wordsmithery and deliver, which make this more than a ‘reading’. John recites, often gymnastically, using a variety of voice and vocal mechanics to emphasize and color select words and phrases. English, Spanish and French dovetail and mesh, zig-zagging from one language to the other. Even English sounds like an array of dialects, and words often disintegrate into strange mid-transmission ‘vocalizations’. I enjoyed it as avant-garde poetry and vocal ‘music’ rolled into one.\n\n\n\nBret’s ‘side’ of the split features him utilizing ebow guitar, radio samples, bass and percussion to create a piece titled ‘Two-Thirds Dead Already’. It opens like the soundtrack to a spaced out, screechy Geisha tea ceremony. But the Oriental vibe quickly mutates into a psychedelically fractured yet pleasantly musical chorus of moaning and howling instrumental song. Voice samples, which sound backwards at times and slowed down at others, including demon baby cooing that turns out to be radio news at a sinister sounding slowed down pace, crop up to inject healthy doses of eerie sounds, making for a creepy collage of dissonant, psychedelic noise-folk jamming and varied voices, which later becomes more stumbling and out of sync acid rocking. But as eerie/creepy as it all sounds, Bret also adds hip-shaking cha-cha music, jazz horns, and plenty more into a psychotropic stew of valium voiced newscasters, mangled, peacefully shrieking strings, drones, radio dial surfing and static, and other free-wheeling music and sounds. LOTS going on here!",

I’m so pleased to have this gem in physical form that I’d like to share my thoughts with the group.\n\n\n\nSide A of this C60 is a Girls On Fire roller coaster ride through 18 (with one exception) 1+ minute vignettes. This is especially notable for being the first collection of new material from Leslie since the wild west heyday of the 1980s homemade music/cassette culture underground.\n\nI love Leslie’s spoken word delivery, lo-fi synth jams and bleepy blurpy noisy radio signal effects that bring to mind William Burroughs teaming up with an Industrial version of Kraftwerk. Leslie’s delivery can be intense when doing spoken word and it’s good joyous fun when she sings. I like how she uses her lo-fi sounds to create choppity beats. It often feels like we’re ROCKIN’!\n\n\n\nAmong the individual tracks that caught my attention, ‘Chainsaw Accident’ is a cool country fried radio effects rocker. ‘Freezer Burn’ sounds like Leslie is casting an evil spell in her cavern domain while some poor slob is eaten by her minions. ‘I Did My Laundry Today’ is a zany, electro and sound delirious, punk poet ranting lo-fi song. The more I hear these tunes the more I’m loving the music that sounds like a sci-fi Saturday morning cartoons brand of kiddie tune. When I was very young I remember this toy that was circular and ringed with animals. You’d pull the string and it would play this crazy kiddie music before landing on an animal and hearing the sound it makes. ‘NYC Got The Neutron Bomb’ is another stand out on which Leslie gets down with her bad Punk ‘n’ Roll self.\n\n\n\nAnd at nearly 9 minutes, ‘Darling, I Love You’ is the one lengthier track of the Girls On Fire set. Leslie’s spoken word shares the spotlight with a robotic virtual voice and crazed laughing samples. I love the tinkling melodies, electronic blasts, and bits of song that make this a free-wheeling collage/song/effects mash up, like some whimsical industrial, ranting poet, Romper Room cut-up. At the end I hear…. Was this recorded live at one of Hal’s apartment gatherings?\n\n\n\nI’m sure everyone in the EC group knows this but I’ll point out that there is detailed Leslie Singer/Girls On Fire documentation at Hal’s web site. Spend some time there:  www.haltapes.com/girls-on-fire.html\n\n\n\n The B-side is one continuous trademark Hal McGee audio collage diary. I never tire of these. This is surprisingly musical, with multiple contrasting melodies throughout. Hal is conversing with someone, going from ranting about how the world is filled with idiots to cheering the best cake he ever had to a bit about the ‘mask test’ in moments.\n\n\n\nDamn, I’m diggin’ the music. A bleepy synth, a stringed instrument that must be the ‘two-string pink dumpster guitar’ (a pic in the Comments please Hal!), a tab dosed Mr Roger’s Neighborhood styled melody, keys that sound kinda jazzy, a noisily fuzzed avant trip out jam that sounds like Soft Machine’s Mike Ratledge for the lo-fi set, spacey atmospherics, and more. At one point we hear multiple hallucinatory Hal voices amidst a lovely space-pastoral noodling melody, and crazed synth jams. I like the cool tribal percussion orchestra bit that Hal freeform speaks over too. All in a day in Hal’s life…\n\n\n\nI did mention Stanley is on here too, didn’t I? I mean, goes without saying…",

The movie features voices, images, contributions and inspirations (knowing and unknowing) by Stanley The Paperanian, Lumen K, Leslie Singer, Rafael González, family members, co-workers, neighbors, grocery store employees, and fellow passengers on public transportation.\n\n\n\nI recorded the audio assemblage materials with Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphones from March 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020. On April 2, 2020 I constructed an assemblage of these audio materials and added it to the movie. I then exported all of the audio from the movie, including sounds from the short video clips within the movie. What you hear on this album is the dictaphone assemblage and the audio from the video clips blended together.\n\n\n\nFor this audio album I have divided the 61-minute soundtrack arbitrarily into two parts for the listener’s convenience.",

Times Like These Call For Desperate Measures\n\n2. Don’t Panic!\n\n\n\nThe assemblage is split into two sections, and it includes spoken words by me and Leslie, me playing the KQ Unotone iPhone synthesizer, various iPhone sounds, family members, neighbors, co-workers, grocery store employees, rainstorms, pocket recordings, birds, dogs, helicopters, car alarm, traffic sounds, etc. I used three Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphones to make these recordings, and you will hear the sounds I recorded with them mixed by random chance procedures in an audio assemblage along with sounds from the video clips from the April 2020 movie, which you can view here —  youtu.be/rrT6Q9h8EnU.",

      "about": "it is HAPPENING again\n\ndictaphone assemblage\n\n​audio folk art\n\n​featuring Leslie Singer\n\nand Stanley\n\n\n\nrecorded January 2019 ​in Gainesville, Florida and New York City\n\n​with five ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphones\n\n​photographs by Hal and Leslie\n\n\n\nvisit a special album information page where you can view a slideshow of 65 photos by Hal and Leslie: \n\nwww.electroniccottage.org/hal-mcgee/it-is-happening-again\n\n\n\n \"it is HAPPENING again\" is intended to be and ideally should be experienced as one continuous 78-minute audio assemblage. For the listener's convenience and to make available access points within the assemblage I have broken the assemblage into four sections at arbitrary points and have assigned titles to the parts. Also, the entire 78-minute piece exceeds Bandcamp's upload limits, dammit!\n\n\n\nI carry a Sony ICD-PX470 stereo digital dictaphone (I own four) in my pocket wherever I go and I made recordings every day throughout the month of January 2019. Leslie Singer used a ICD-PX470 of her own to make 28 recordings during January and sent them to me. I loaded her recordings onto one of my four dictaphones (along with recordings I made on that dictaphone). On January 31, 2019 I played all four dictaphones through a Xenyx mixer directly into Audacity on my desktop iMac computer and captured the mix of the recordings collected on the four dictaphones with next to no tweaking of the sounds as the assemblage unfolded and created itself.\n\n\n\nIn this assemblage you will hear many different sounds from my daily life in the month of January 2019, along with spoken and performed and everyday sounds by Leslie. Some of those sounds include:\n\nspoken word poems and texts, instrumental improvisations, sounds from Apartment Music shows #32 and #33, Stanley barking (no kidding!), me (and Leslie) taking Stanley on walks, conversations, restaurants, sounds from my job, watching some of Leslie's videos from the 1980s, gadgets and noisemakers, Jiblit Dupree and Leslie jamming on guitars, excerpts from Girls On Fire's first new performances in more than three decades, Leslie reading her recollections of the Apartment Music shows, construction sounds, emergency vehicles, and much more!\n\nThanks to Adam Naworal for contributing some great spoken parts about \"collages within collages\"!",

Boyd\n\nFrank Audiffret, Lasse Jensen, Jiblit Dupree\n\nCharles Rice Goff III, Rafael González, Jonas Juuso\n\nElias Ulvestad, Felix Ziska, and Penny Grune-Fae\n\n\n\n On January 19, 2018 I celebrated my 60th Birthday and I must say that I consider myself fortunate to have survived this long. Aside from high blood pressure and prostate issues (both effectively controlled with daily medications), and of course my moderately severe hearing loss, I consider myself to be in excellent health for a 60 year old. I don’t drink alcohol or smoke anything any more, so that ought to help! I do love coffee and they’ll have to pry my coffee cup from my cold dead hand before I will be convinced to give up coffee! I hope and plan to continue existing in this corporeal human form for several more decades, making as much art mischief as I can.\n\n\n\nNotes on Supplemental Materials:\n\n\n\n On Saturday, January 13th my brother Mark and I traveled to Lakeland, Florida for Stipulation Fest, an improvisation event co-curated by Dylan Houser and myself, and hosted by Dylan in his home (aka Nullis Prettii ov Lakeland). 12 solo improvisers were required to play through small 10-watt amps or acoustically, with minimal plug-n-play gear set-ups, and a nine-minute time limit on performances enforced with a darkroom timer clock.\n\n\n\n The 12 performers were: Penny Grune-Fae, Trotsky’s Watercolor (Dan Reaves), Watchable Wildlife (Mullarkey), Vallam, Jiblit Dupree (Danny McGuire), Hal McGee, Orphling (Jeremiah Paddock), Fiver’s Stereo (Jay Peele), Vasectomy Party (Hal Harmon), Shawn Blackburn, Jonas Van den Bossche, and Hell Garbage (Dylan Houser).\n\n\n\n In the audio assemblages you might hear the voices of these performers, as well as other attendees of the event. \n\n\n\n Included in the materials here are several photos that I took during the event, plus additional photos by Danny McGuire and Dylan. I was not able to take photos of all of the performers because my hands were busy holding the video camera!\n\n\n\n I recorded all of the performances on video and published them on YouTube. You can view a playlist of all 12 videos here: \n\nwww.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6iCLTPhajwY0ulvey4Y9nQfbLT7AVL6l\n\n\n\n  A few days before Stipulation Fest, Ryan Patrick\n\nO’ Doud published an interview with me about the background of Stipulation Fest, my previous improvisation events, and my philosophy of improvisation in the 13th issue of his online zine, Issues: \n\nwww.facebook.com/CFRIssuesmagazine/\n\n Included here is a jpeg of that interview page.\n\n\n\nA personal note:\n\n\n\n I do not listen to music or noise for pleasure any more, due to continuing moderately severe hearing loss. Most of my audioworks these days are highly personal dictaphone diary assemblages, such as this one. Construction of this audio art form requires minimal listening and mixing and therefore the risk of further damage to my hearing is minimal. I might eventually stop making new audio art and just do zines and mail art.\n\n I will continue to create these dictaphone assemblages for as long as I can for close friends and for those people who care to listen to them, and for the pure love and joy of it. These recordings are my way of trying to bring happiness, joy, and love to a world that desperately needs as much fun as possible to counteract all of the hate and anger and violence. These are personal folk art offerings, done with love and care for those people who want them. They are humbly, modestly offered as gifts from my life.",

      "about": "Lumen Kishkumen and Hal McGee\n\nThe Hidden Path\n\na microcassette collaboration recorded July-September 2015\n\n​in Utah and Gainesville, Florida\n\n\n\n​The Hidden Path is an exploration in folding maps of sound and pinning them through with the art of the mixer. Folding, mixing, and pinning, to breach the barriers of space and time to find hidden paths and create new spaces. Be prepared to laugh.\n\n\n\nLumen Kishkumen recorded a 30-minute microcassette of sounds while on vacation with his family in Utah. Hal McGee recorded a 30-minute microcassette of sounds consisting of Hal and Lumen talking together and various sounds from his daily life. McGee then mixed the two tapes together into a collage loaded with commentaries on itself and creative processes, an explosion of audio sensations, and numerous comical bits.\n\n\n\n1. Pioneers. To do the same thing and a new thing all at once. Celebrating the past that never was in the hope of a future that will never be. Never despairing.\n\n\n\n2. Toads. Someone made a path and blocked the way with maps to paths in every direction. The call came, and it was a frog. One man rushes along the path to where the frog is said to be. Another man looks for a book. Both men find a Toad.",

      "about": "Meshed Mixages was a 3-way mail collaboration created in 2002. Bret Hart created an hour of sounds made with various homemade instruments in North Carolina. Bret sent his sounds to Charles Rice Goff III in Kansas who treated the Hart sounds and added sounds of his own. Charlie then sent the Goff-Hart sounds to Hal McGee in Florida who added sounds of his own, plus some untreated Hart sounds, and then mixed the elements together.\n\nOriginally issued on CDR by the artists.\n\nCover artwork layout by Goff.\n\n\n\nCurrent contact zone of Bret Hart \n\nwww.facebook.com/pages/Songs-and-Organized-Noises-1982-present-Bret-Hart/215554098489362\n\n Current contact zone of Charlie Goff \n\ntapedrugs.com\n\n\n\n Review by Jerry Kranitz\n\nFrom Aural Innovations #22 (January 2003) \n\nwww.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue22/hfharhal.html\n\n\n\n Bret Hart, Hal McGee, and Charles Rice Goff III... a trio of DIY underground giants putting their collective heads together to produce music, noise, and sounds designed to captivate and confuse the senses. It's all here too... noise and percussion bits, carnival organ parading around with electro noise patterns, Bret's guitar attacks, scattered percussion, hair raising sonic assaults (caution with the volume!), and plenty more. I dig the avant-garde orchestral and free-improv pieces like \"The Alones\". \"Trigger\" is similar but includes voice samples arranged in strange ways with freaky sounds. \"Uhura\" is a wild free-improv/collage glom of electronics, strings, percussion and samples. And for space fans we've got \"Smithy\", \"Man Dough\", \"Her Rubber Toe\" and \"Pectoral Glance\" which all feature fun mindfucked alien cosmic weirdness. And the list goes on. The scary thing is I think I'm at the point with these guys that I'm confident I can pick out their individual contributions to each piece. An intriguing set of strangeness that fans of either of these three will surely enjoy.",

      "about": "HalTapes presents\n\nJeff Chenault\n\nSonic Rebirth\n\n\n\nAn album of new experimental electronic music by Jeff Chenault of Columbus, Ohio. A friend and associate of Hunting Lodge, Chenault was a key figure in the 1980s homemade music cassette culture movement. He released numerous cassettes under the name Jeff Central, and operated the ITN label. Sonic Rebirth includes appearances by John M. Bennett, Paul Lemos, and Dan Rockwell.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nThis tape is a compilation of recordings I did back in 2012. They represent some of my first recordings after a long hiatus. I have to credit my good friend Dan Rockwell with introducing me to the iPad and motivating me to create music again. The technology today has opened up a whole new world of creative possibilities for me. These pieces are minimal in nature and I like them that way. All the tracks were recorded straight to cassette tape. There was no overdubbing of any kind. Like most of my music everything was spontaneous and\n\nunplanned! Some of these tracks represent ongoing experiments with friends and collaborators whose work I highly respect and admire.\n\n\n\nI wish to thank Hal McGee for giving me an outlet for these recordings that would otherwise been swept under the proverbial audio carpet!\n\n\n\nThis tape is dedicated to James Beoddy\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nJeff Chenault, 2015\n\nColumbus, Ohio\n\nexoteque at gmail dot com",

      "about": "HalTapes presents\n\n\n\nPhinney/McGee\n\nAntenna Club\n\n\n\nThe first official online issue of this album of experimental electronic space noise music by Chris Phinney and Hal McGee, originally issued on CDR in 2003.\n\n\n\nAnalog hardware and software synthesizers, theremin, samples, loops.\n\n\n\nThanks to Jerry Kranitz for providing digital copies of the artwork. He made this new edition possible!\n\n\n\nOriginal cover painting by Hal McGee.\n\n\n\nReview by Jerry Kranitz in the August 2003 issue of Aural Innovations:\n\n\n\nin the The latest collaboration between two of the elder statesmen of the homemade electronic music underground is jam packed with noisy, chaotic and totally cosmic exploratory fun. Chris and Hal blast out of the starting gates full tilt toward the sky on \"Timetunnel\". The engines are fired up but this old clunker is making lots of straaaaaange noises. I don't know if there's trouble on board but the sirens are blaring and it's like somebody decided to hold an air raid drill on the Challenger (I'll give away my age and say that I remember having air raid drills in grade school). But throughout this 10 minute slab of space terrorism I felt like I was a stowaway on a rocket and the only decent hiding place I could find was smack in the belly of the engine room. I often make such engine room references with these guys and they always manage to keep it interesting and exciting. In this case it's much more intense than usual and Klaus Schulze fans can expect to have that dreamy smile of serenity wiped clean off their faces. But it's funny that I should get that impression from the opening track because the last track, \"Milky Way Marauders\", is the one piece on the album that does fall very nicely into the Schulze/Tangerine Dream style of syncopated cosmic space.\n\n\n\n\"Tapestry Of Creation And Destruction\" is similar to \"Timetunnel\" but with lush orchestral symphonics rising and falling in the mix. A wild as hell combination. Things calm down a bit on \"Shocking Secrets Of The Crab Nebula\", though the music is still multi-layered and busy, and a sense of urgency permeates throughout. Chris and Hal excel at creating image inducing scenes of cosmic chaos that keep the listener wide eyed and at attention. \"The Wrong Kind Of Galaxy\" keeps the pace moving briskly, combining dark bubbling patterns and short wave radio space madness. \"Calcutta Brothel Raid (Delayed Transmission)\" directs us into different territory as tribal drumming and chants takes center stage while whining minimal keyboard lines drone along like bagpipes, ocean waves crash against the shore, and an assortment of freaky sounds rear their lovely heads. The aptly titled \"Insectoid Assembly Line\" has a strange robotic head boppin groove that I enjoyed. And things get downright heavenly on \"Stargrove\"... fallen angels raining down like kamikaze pilots at a Toy R Us picnic with the pops. Veteran of the HalTapes and Harsh Reality catalogs will be delighted, and newcomers who are in any way intrigued by these descriptions should throw caution to the wind and take the plunge. \n\n\n\naural-innovations.com/2003/august/halchris.html",

Incidental Vibrations 3\n\n\n\nIncidental Vibrations is a live recording from September 24, 1986 at the Hoosier Ballroom in Indianapolis, Indiana. Totally improvised ultra-minimalist on-the-spot stream-of-consciousness free association dada fluxus deconstructed rock music performance art comedy farce by Hal McGee (Dog As Master) and the legendary and mysterious quartet Jabon, who hail from Stinesville, Indiana. A cautionary tale about the pitfalls of ingesting hallucinogenics before a live performance. Not for all tastes - proceed with caution. An extension of some of the deconstructed rock \"techniques\" on 60 Minutes Of Laughter. Contains curious references to Symbolic Accidents Of Ceremony by Bwana Dog; cigarette butts, diet soft drinks, club sandwiches, bats (the flying kind), the Marquis De Sade, the TV show Dallas; and innumerable decontextualized blues and rock \"gestures\" and riffs. All notions about \"content\" are stripped away and live performance is reduced down to the level of a free-form automatistic collage of random incidents, non sequiturs, and thoughts about nothing in particular. Audience reactions and laugh tracks were NOT added on after the fact. Originally issued on C20 cassette on the Cause And Effect label. \n\n\n\nIncidental Vibrations 2 was recorded at the Adamson Wing, Baker Hall, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Saturday, May 16, 1987, before the Dog As Master set (Dog As Master Live In Pittsburgh).

      "about": "HalTapes presents\n\n\n\nHal McGee\n\npossibilities\n\n\n\n50 short piano improvisations\n\nrecorded Summer 2003\n\n\n\nreview by Jerry Kranitz from the January 2004 issue of Aural Innovations:\n\n\n\nPossibilities is an album that came as a pleasant surprise and I would never have guessed it was Hal. The album consists of 50 solo piano pieces, mostly played in a style similar to that heard on Professor McGee's Laboratory and American Primitive, though of course with everything else going on I only focused so much on the piano on those CD's. But hell, Hal can really play. The music has a composed feel, being played in a concert piano style that is highly accessible, though by no means mainstream. At times we hear the wild eyed passionate concert pianist, and at others Hal has the light melodic touch. The music is thoughtful and highly expressive. Quite nice hearing this purely musical side of Hal.\n\n\n\nThanks to Jerry Kranitz for providing digital copies of the artwork.\n\nHe made this new edition possible!",

Another interesting lo-fi assemblage of day in the life ephemera, much of it pretty cool musical bits that I assume is in the studio Alphastare was on his way to. I especially like the spacey UFO synth workout accompanying a simple repetitive melodic riff.\n\n\n\nHal picks up on the humor of Alphastare’s descriptions by listing his collage toolkit as “The usual stuff”, including Best Buy dumbfuck, I float the recorder in the toilet water, save the ta-tas… fun stuff indeed, and sure enough this is trademark Hal, who I’ll wind down this article by saying is in my opinion the master of the diarist audio collage. Hal goes about life in the ho hum way that most of us do, but manages to offer slices of his life, via audio art recordings, in ways that are both interesting and fun.\n\n\n\nOne of the standout aspects is Hal’s voice, which is very distinct. But he also interacts comfortably with others, and the exchanges, which range from banal to interesting, are often downright hilarious. Having heard a large number of these over the years, my favorite recurring conversations are those he has with a particular female co-worker, which can be hysterically funny. But at the end of the day it’s the characteristically Hal way it’s all stitched together that makes these the audio artifacts that they are.",

      "about": "HalTapes presents\n\nA HAMSTER IN YOUR SANDWICH\n\nPoetry, Word, and Sound Art\n\nC. Mehrl Bennett John M. Bennett\n\n\n\nFluxus poets, mail and multimedia artists John M. Bennett and Catherine Mehrl Bennett collaborated on A Hamster In Your Sandwich, which consists of two side-long free improvisations of spoken poetry and minimal instrumentation such as flute, kalimba, ocarina, keyboard, ukulele, etc. A matrix of sounds, music, and language which doesn't really give priority to any of those modes of expression, and which, with some editing after the initial recording session, creates its own unique form and structure. With nods to Dada, Surrealism, and primitivism.\n\n\n\nCMB and JMB:\n\nvoices, clay ocarina, clay flute, a metal/ceramic bowl and a stick, a piece of crushed catalytic converter, jingle bell, electronic piano, bird clock, sheep baaing thing, small kalimba, spinner hand drum, harmonica, ukulele\n\n\n\nRead Cathy Bennett's blog post about the creation of A HAMSTER IN YOUR SANDWICH: \n\ncmehrlbennett.wordpress.com/2014/10/07/a-hamster-in-your-sandwich/\n\n\n\n C.

      "about": "HalTapes presents\n\nJay T. Yamamoto and Captain Mission split:\n\n In order to bring back to the original shapes\n\n it is necessary for you to do the process as follows\n\n\n\nJay T. Yamamoto\n\nTrack 1. - Side A of the tape\n\n1. The alleged castration of Rudolf Schwartzkogler\n\n2. Version (version)\n\n3. Dirty Mary's Acid Test in Scissors Land\n\n4. The transgressive autoeroticism of Günter Brus\n\n5. Unfinished Landscape #2\n\n\n\n- \"The alleged castration of Rudolf Schwartzkogler\" and \"The transgressive autoeroticism of Günter Brus\" are noise improvisations based on the famous works of Viennese Actionism. They are not so much direct interpretations of those works as they are my abstract impressions of those works reduced to pure psycho-acoustic expression.\n\n- \"Version (version)\" came out of a series of experiments in pure \"ambient\" music (i.e. music not meant to be directly listened to) based on a glitch in my Casio keyboard that caused it to freeze up while producing a continuous tone. I added an electronic \"beat\" and some musique concrète noises to turn it into a proper \"song\".\n\n- \"Dirty Mary's Acid Test in Scissors Land\" is an experiment in trying to get back into doing more long- form songs. Structurally it's based on Pink Floyd's long suite-like songs - \"A Saucerful Of Secrets\" in particular. Though there's also an Amon Düül influence in there as well. The title is a reference to an especially psychedelic episode of the original (1970s) \"Cutey Honey\" - I think it was episode 5 or 6.\n\n- \"Unfinished Landscape #2\" is an out-take from \"TSOLF\" that I found while going through my tapes to see which ones were okay to recycle. It's an unfinished song in the \"Hallucinated Landscape\" series. Despite its incomplete state, upon hearing it again I thought it worked well enough on its own and wanted it released here.\n\n Summer 2014 except \"Unfinished Landscape #2\" (2013)\n\n\n\nJTY\n\n98-085 Puakukui Place, Aiea, HI 96701 USA\n\nmagicktuna at gmail dot com\n\n\n\nCaptain Mission\n\nTrack 2. - Side B of the tape\n\neverything that is taken into parts by the acid, the first thing seen is a very small bubble beginning to come out of the matter.\n\n\n\nRecorded September 2014.\n\nOriginally issued on cassette on the Kassette Kult Tapes label\n\nK7KT 010\n\nstill available on cassette, here \n\nwww.haltapes.com/kassette-kult-tapes.html\n\n\n\n Related recordings: \n\nhalmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/tsolf\n\n  halmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/caution-lo-fi",

      "about": "HalTapes presents\n\nWalls Of Genius\n\nNow Not Then\n\n\n\n1980s Cassette Culture anti-heroes Walls Of Genius are back with their first album since 1986! Evan Cantor, Little Fyodor, and Ed Fowler present 90 minutes of all new material --Classic Rock turned upside down on its ear, scintillating reinventions of 1960s moldy oldies, and free improvisational dementia. Not for all tastes, you'll either love it or hate it. Prepare to be wowed by masterful musical feats of genius! Also prepare to be disgusted, amazed, and just downright perplexed.\n\n\n\nEd Fowler: electric guitar, percussion\n\nEvan Cantor: electric & acoustic guitar, saxophone, bass guitar, drums, keys, ukulele, vocals\n\nLittle Fyodor: electric guitar, slide whistle, percussion, synthesizers, vocals\n\n\n\nThis represents the first fabulous WoG reunion session ever\n\nMay 16, 2014, at Beachfront Studios, Boulder, Colorado\n\n(c) 2014 Walls Of Genius\n\n\n\nOriginally released on cassette in July 2014\n\non the Kassette Kult Tapes label, K7KT 002.\n\n\n\nRead more about Walls Of Genius: \n\nwww.haltapes.com/walls-of-genius-comprehensive-archive.html\n\n\n\n Evan Cantor website: \n\nevancantor.com\n\n\n\n Little Fyodor website: \n\nwww.littlefyodor.com\n\n\n\n From 1982-1986, Walls Of Genius (WOG) represented everything that was totally twisted and creatively cool about that era’s homemade music cassette culture underground. These guys were all over the map, recording songs, acid rock, spaced out excursions, avant-Prog, sound collage and abstract experimentations. And nobody did cover songs like WOG. Now Not Then consists of the first WOG reunion of Ed Fowler, Evan Cantor and Little Fyodor since 1986, and across two discs offers up heaping doses of pent up creative muscle flexing that has been lying dormant in the intervening years.\n\n - Read Jerry Kranitz's complete review of Now Not Then at the Aural Innovations blog: \n\naural-innovations.com/blog/2014/12/walls-of-genius-now-not-then-haltapes-2014-2-cdrdownload/",

Urban sounds, sundry street occurrences, crowd noise, background music ranging from traditional Greek to New Orleans Jazz, even the simple sound of walking. None of the voices are at the forefront, making this an avant-garde pastiche of the more subtle portions of everyday life.\n\n\n\nHal, on the other hand, nearly always puts his thoughts and conversations with others in the spotlight, mixing spoken word with exchanges between himself and co-workers and anyone else he encounters on his travels. Hal records his own audio journal, in this case visiting Dudley Farm in Newberry, Florida. He talks to others, either fellow visitors or tour guides, reads some of the explanatory signs in his own inimitable style, and among other spots on the tour we visit the chickens, and damned if one didn’t just lay an egg. They sound like cute little buggers. Audio journals are on a certain level simplistic, yet the interest lies in placing yourself in the artist’s shoes and feeling like you’re along for the ride, which is all the more fun given the clickity clackity cut up stitch and mix nature of the recording.",

Two side-long pieces recorded in 1985-86, ultra-ambient environments. GREEN is a soundtrack to journeys through dense stretches of wet foliage and broad fields of windswept Spring grass. Your eyes close, you drift off into the pastoral splendor of Dog As Master, pondering reflections of your inner mind... You respond vaguely to the murmuring of voices carried on the wind.. All is seemingly peaceful in this GREEN world as you contentedly sip your chlorophyll milkshake. Death nears.\"\n\n- Cause And Effect 1987 Catalogue",

This is a high intensity Space-Noise excursion that’s equal parts abrasive interstellar luge competition and spacecraft engine room activity. One moment we’re jettisoned through supersonic waves of noise debris, and the next we’re in a gaggle of bleeps, blurps, pulsations and static. It’s totally spaced out but in a sand blaster sort of way.\n\n\n\nHal too explores experimental electronic space, creating Space-Industrial electronica with Arturia MicroBrute analog synthesizer and Moog MF-104 Analog Delay. I like the rapid-fire pulsations alongside raging cosmic buzzsaw, which together create a harrowing headphones experience. 15 minutes of white knuckled, nail biting intensity that is, nonetheless, disturbingly hypnotic.",

Birds tweeting, the wind and the sound of cars driving by.\n\n* From my dad's workshop: Messing around with random metal rods and a bunch of scrap metal. Banging my fist against a large metal drum. Slamming a large heavy door.\n\n* Outdoors: Conversing with the cat.\n\n* Went for a walk in a wooded area: Throwing pinecones in a pool of water. Grinding some jagged rocks. Throwing said rocks in a pool of water. Walking on a sandy path. Birds tweeting. Water trickling in a creek. Water running through a pipe. More tweets.\n\n\n\nMarch 31, 2014\n\n* Monotron and Monotron Duo sounds and cassette tape of me talking. Passed through the Monotron Delay.\n\n\n\nThe 'Sony Microcassette-corder M-455' was used for this recording. I was a bit disappointed in how much noise from the motor that was pick up by the mic. Originally I planned on using a 'Radionette' microcassette recorder, but when I recieved it in the mail it turned out to be in terrible condition and it sounded pretty much like crap.\n\n\n\nVisit my Bandcamp site for more of my recordings: \n\nufoodd.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nHal McGee\n\n\"Social Anxiety\"\n\nrecorded April 8-28\n\non a Sony M-470 microcassette recorder\n\n\n\nrain on umbrella, shortwave radio (including a Numbers Station), kazoo, talking with a co-worker, cigar box diddley bow, Stanley, piano lady in lobby, voice, life monitor signal, street recordings, talking with a customer at the Wal-Mart pharmacy, talking with my mom",

      "about": "HAL MCGEE VS. BLACK BEAST OF ARRRGHHH\n\nwith deconstructed documentation\n\n\n\nIn November 2013 BBOA invited Hal McGee to do a \"versus\" audio work which BBOA would release on CDR. Hal recorded a personal correspondence audio letter on a 30-minute microcassette for black beast of arrrghhh. For his part of the versus release Hal created a stereo mix of the two 15-minute sides of his microcassette audio letter, and burned the 15-minute mix onto a CDR and mailed it to BBOA along with the 30-minute audio letter tape. BBOA recorded an audio response on a 30-minute microcassette. He then mixed the two sides of his tape together into one 15-minute track. BBOA combined his mix with Hal's mix to create \"Hal McGee vs. black beast of arrrghhh\", a special personal edition CDR release.\n\n\n\nThe first track here is the final \"Hal McGee vs. black beast of arrrghhh\" mix created by BBOA for the CDR release. Also included are the four sides of the two microcassette tapes, and the sub mixes created by McGee and BBOA. In effect, you will hear a deconstructed documentation of the creation of \"Hal McGee vs. black beast of arrrghhh\".\n\n\n\nblack beast of arrrghhh sound sources and objects:\n\n\n\n- Dryer and Dryer alarm\n\n- Dishwasher\n\n- Washing machine\n\n- Other random kitchen noises \n\n- Yamaha Clavinova CVP-10\n\n- Typing on a computer keyboard\n\n- Jiblit Dupree\n\n- Field recording of crows and traffic\n\n- Field recording of an electric saw\n\n- Squeaky computer chair\n\n\n\nRecorded on a GE Microcassette recorder, Model No.3-53798.\n\nEmbrace Your Messy Side article from Good Housekeeping magazine.\n\nFinal audio mix by BBOA.\n\nBBOA email:\n\nblackbeastofarrrghhh (at) yahoo (dot) com\n\n\n\nHal McGee sound sources:\n\n\n\n- Hal talking to black beast of arrrghhh\n\n- silliness with co-worker\n\n- a strange talent of mine telling the correct temperature\n\n- power port erosion\n\n- Jiblit Dupree message for BBOA on my voicemail\n\n- a rock is not a rock\n\n- organic grain fed Bison hot dogs\n\n- Noisemusick iPhone app\n\n- talking with neighbor at the bus stop and sounds on the bus\n\n- volunteers needed for fatigue study\n\n- sounds from my job\n\n- dog squeaky toy\n\n- pelvic pain sensitivity\n\n\n\nRecorded with a Sony M-470 microcassette recorder.\n\n\n\nRecorded in St. Petersburg and Gainesville, Florida, November 2013-February 2014.",

      "about": "36 minute bruitistic tape collage of overlapping layers of shrill Moog synthesizer patterns, noise blasts from a Commodore 64 data cassette, orgasm and sex noises, cascades of tape cut-ups, distorted electric guitar, voice choruses, spoken word, sirens, alarm clock, organ drones. Noisy and chaotic, with a high energy electronic sound.\n\n\n\nBlack Body was the third cassette tape release of Hal McGee's solo project Dog As Master. I recorded this album with a Fostex X-15 four-track cassette recorder. This took me about six months to create.\n\n- Originally released on cassette in 1985, C37, on the Cause And Effect label.\n\n\n\nreview by Alessandro Aiello, Constrictor, 1985: \n\n\"BLACK BODY is a strong suite that has the same serenity and awareness of a powerful precious work even if it's composed of a cluster of sound-noise-music and by a series of pauses, models of sounds. McGee's answer to the high concept of creating a connection with serial electronic music.\" \n\n\n\nA black body is an object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls onto it. No radiation passes through it and none is reflected, yet in classical physics, it can theoretically radiate any possible wavelength of energy.\n\n\n\n- Black Body was mastered on a Fuji FR Metal Type IV 46-minute cassette tape, with no Dolby Noise Reduction.",

One continuous 47-minute track, hewn from the same mass of sonic material as Black Body.\n\n- Originally released on cassette in 1985, C46, on the Cause And Effect label; re-released by Freedom In A Vacuum, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (1990). \n\n\n\nreview by Mike Gunderloy, Factsheet Five, 1985: \n\n\"Usually I'm not all that thrilled with experimental music, but I took a shine to this one, perhaps because of its outright obnoxiousness. Most of the tape is somewhere between dead silence and low-level white noise. But the listener who cranks it up will be sorry, because this is punctuated at irregular intervals by blasts of electronic sound. Not easy to listen to, but strangely rewarding.\"\n\n\n\n- Trompeur Et Sournois was mastered on a Sony UCX-S90 Type II High Bias cassette tape, with Dolby B Noise Reduction.",

      "about": "Microcassette recordings by Hal McGee, July 2013.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, July 26, 2013 I improvised a mix of two 60-minute microcassettes that I had recorded of various random sounds in a collage fashion, sort of arbitrarily. One of the two tapes was originally intended for a collaboration with Rafael González. I took that tape and mixed it with another tape of stuff that I recorded and therefore collaborated with myself in a microcassette duo!\n\n\n\nI split the two 30-minute mixes into four 15-minute pieces for your listening convenience. Those of you who like lots of electronic sounds will want to check out part 4 especially.\n\n\n\nThe two microcassettes include these sounds:\n\n\n\n- voicemails and telephone & in-person conversations with Jiblit Dupree (Danny McGuire) - especially on the first three parts.\n\n\n\n- extensive use of Korg Monotron analog synthesizers - original, Duo, and Delay - played separately, simultaneously, and linked together - mostly played through a Pignose 7-100 amp, but also recorded via the MIC jack of a desktop microcassette recorder (which added distortion).\n\n\n\n- recordings of everyday sounds, such as -\n\nrain on truck roof, bus driver announcement, urine, Chinese fortune cookies, talking with co-workers at my job and with neighbors at the bust stop, bulletin board flyer announcements, my voice saying stuff and making other mouth sounds, raindrops on umbrella, crickets chirping, birds singing, John Wayne had pop music hits!, Bono is a douchebag, Bono saved Africa!, shotgun, murder in the neighborhood, Casio keyboards (VA-10, circuit bent SK-1, SA-47), melodica, voicemails from three special guest contributors, ukulele, if you don't believe in anything you can't lose faith, Kim Kardashian & Kanye West & the Devil's spawn, the voices of my brother and father, there are a thousand ways to die, handjobs & blowjobs, water pump, piano lady in the lobby, shopping for canned pumpkin at Publix is a pleasure, other people's conversations, shrimp & grits, La Fiesta chips & salsa, cockroaches running across the table at Japanese steak house, my dog, a little bit gaudy, electric toothbrush, ATM, Pink Floyd road crew and crack ho's, dolphins are awesome, sportsman's double, Florida is still a jungle.\n\n\n\nTHIS MICROCASSETTE RECORDER KILLS FASCISTS!\n\nI HOPE THAT YOU WILL HAVE FUN LISTENING TO THIS TAPE!",

      "about": "Two cassette releases by Dog As Master from 1987, The Splendor, and Live In Pittsburgh, are offered together in one release.\n\n\n\nThe Splendor by Dog As Master was originally released by Manny Theiner on his SSS Productions label of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1987.\n\n\n\nThe first side of the tape consisted of three tracks of harsh, abrasive, dirge-like, violent, noisy, feedback-laden power electronics with a droning, killer bottom end. The instrumentation, orchestral samples, and the screamed and moaned vocals, were looped and processed through a Casio SK-1 sampling keyboard. Love/hate, rage-lust, death-wish, self-hatred, desires to commit brutal violence on a trusted person who betrayed. The tape is partly a parody or spoof, but the emotions are all real and heartfelt (because my relationship with Debbie Jaffe was coming apart at the seams...).\n\n\n\nSide Two of the tape contained four-track collage recordings from our home. You can hear us popping popcorn, talking about mundane subjects like cornbread, and chatting and goofing around with our nerdy friends Byron Hoesman and Toby O'Brien - mixed with bits and pieces of the sounds from Side One of the tape.\n\n\n\nSide One of the tape: The Crowd-Pleaser Side - (in which Dog As Master gives the people what they want and proves that everybody loves a good imitation) 14:27\n\n\n\nThe Splendor\n\nI'm So Fucking Angry\n\nPain In The Ass\n\n\n\nSide Two of the tape: The Whatever-The-Hell-I-Want-Side - (in which Dog As Master rolls over and plays dead then rises and falls asleep standing up)\n\n\n\nFun\n\nPork And Beans (The Splendor)\n\n\n\nThe Splendor is presented on Side A of this cassette reissue.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\nDog As Master - Live In Pittsburgh\n\n\n\nCome Here (...)\n\nI'm So Fucking Angry\n\nsecretive phone calls\n\nThe Splendor\n\nthe cage\n\nBrash Pussy\n\nPain In The Ass\n\n\n\nLive In Pittsburgh by Dog As Master was recorded at the Adamson Wing, Baker Hall, Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Saturday, May 16, 1987.\n\n\n\nHal McGee: voices, electronics Moog Rogue and Casio SK-1), tapes, psychiatric mad religion, obtuse mannerisms.\n\n\n\nLive sample and technical assistance by Scott Colburn.\n\n\n\nThis show was organized by Manny Theiner of the SSS label.\n\n\n\nJabon opened the show, followed by Incidental Vibrations 2, a collab performance of DAM and Jabon.\n\n\n\nThe highlight of the DAM set is when I climbed into a large dog cage and delivered a soliloquy called \"The Cage\", based on the track from Places Without Air (1986).\n\n\n\nLive In Pittsburgh was originally released on the Cause And Effect label; reissued by Harsh Reality Music (HR 209).",

      "about": "Side One\n\n\n\nEnclosure I.\n\n The Bucket\n\nEnclosure II.\n\n The Closet\n\nEnclosure III.\n\n The Cage\n\n\n\nSide Two\n\n\n\nEnclosures IV./V.\n\n The Box/\n\n The Cellar\n\n\n\n1986 by Hal McGee\n\nPlaces Without Air by Dog As Master consists of spoken word routines and audio theatrical works. Originally released on cassette on the audiofile Tapes label (aT13), Bayside, New York. Reissued by Cause And Effect in 1988. Re-released by Harsh Reality Music in 1989.\n\n\n\nArticle by Jerry Kranitz from the Harsh Reality Music label archive on Hal McGee's website \n\nwww.haltapes.com/hr141-places-without-air.html\n\n\n\n REVIEW by Jerry Kranitz\n\n \n\nDog As Master was the solo project of Hal McGee. The Places Without Air album enjoyed multiple releases, having started life in 1986 as a cassette album on Carl Howard's audiofile Tapes label, then reissued by Hal and Debbie Jaffe on their Cause And Effect label in 1988, followed by this cassette reissue by Harsh Reality in 1989. Hal later reissued it on CDR on his HalTapes label.\n\n \n\nPlaces Without Air took me completely by surprise, being very different from the electronic/audio-art Dog As Master recordings I’ve heard. The set is dominated by spoken word routines, creating the feel of an avant-garde theater performance. The poetry/narrative deliveries vary from intense ensemble cast, whispers, shouts, crying, and often simultaneous/competing narratives.\n\n \n\nAnyone who is familiar with Hal’s work will understand when I say that he has an instantly recognizable voice and style of speaking. It then shocked me when Hal confirmed that what I thought were multiple different voices on this tape were in fact all him, without any tape speed or pitch manipulations.\n\n \n\nWhile focusing on the speaking I noticed the ‘Enclosure’ that prefixes the four track titles. Hal explains:\n\n“Regarding the theme of ‘Enclosures’ on Places Without Air, all of those audio enclosures are about psychological, mental, psychic claustrophobia. In my early to mid 20s I was treated for schizophrenia, and the medications I was given (Lithium, Stelazine, and Ativan) were utilized to cut out all of my mood swings between ecstatic highs and depressive lows. The problem is that they made me feel like my consciousness was in a box or cage, a highly constrained psychological space. After a while I got really tired of that and decided that I would be better off without those prescription medications. So I, in a sense, cured myself of my schizophrenia by channeling that energy into art and music. And I've continued with that strategy up to the present day.”\n\n \n\nHal’s description reminded me of the Dog As Master live performance in Memphis, Tennessee on October 30, 1987, which includes Hal performing a live version of ‘The Cage’, complete with actual cage. A digitized version of the performance from VHS is available on YouTube: \n\nyoutu.be/M4GCgNL8gc8?si=GUnfrVK4aZ_m1vy3\n\n The audio was released on the Dog As Master Live In Memphis album: \n\nhalmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/live-in-memphis\n\n \n\n Hal adds: “It is worth noting that to put myself in the proper frame of mind I actually recorded the original track on Places Without Air from within a dog cage, probably the same one I used at Memphis.”\n\n \n\nFrom a Harsh Reality perspective, I’ll add that label honcho Chris Phinney organized the Memphis show, which was held at The Antenna club. Chris’ band Viktimized Karcass also performed, as did the late Mike Honeycutt performing as Mystery Hearsay. Hal and Al Margolis were on their Sacrifice of Reason tour as Bwana Dog at the time and Bwana Dog closed the show.\n\n \n\nAdditional links:\n\n \n\nAnother version of ‘The Cage’ can be heard on the Dog As Master The Splendor/Live In Pittsburgh album: \n\nhalmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/the-splendor-live-in-pittsburgh\n\n \n\n Track 5, ‘Untitled (Memphis)’, from the Dog As Master/If, Bwana Painting album is a recording of the October 30 Bwana Dog performance in Memphis: \n\nhalmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/painting\n\n \n\n Even more information about the October 30 show in Memphis (and related background information) can be found on the HR050 Bwana Dog Joint Venture cassette album page: \n\nwww.haltapes.com/hr050-joint-venture.html",

      "about": "Connection Cassette Compilation #7 was originally released in early 2013. The original version of this compilation was issued on cassette. All contributors received a copy of the compilation on the same cassette on which they sent their contribution. \n\n\n\nAs much as possible, this cassette compilation project has been done in the original spirit of the 1980s cassette art scene. \n\n\n\nThe audio versions here were taken directly from the original contributor tapes and are higher sound quality than on the cassette copies that were issued, because there is not two generation loss in sound from contributor copy to cassette master to distributed copy. Be sure to download the full size album artwork and print your own cover.

The original sound source material by Fuglewicz, composed on software synthesizers, was remixed and added to by McGee on a bunch of analog synths and circuit-bent instruments producing all manner of electronically derived sounds. McGee, as mixer, really sticks to his Burroughsian guns on this one, using chance tactics to slam sound fields against one another, creating their own unintentional logic. These compositions (there are four) are built from such disparate sonic events that they seem to be always moving towards some impossible destination. Fuglewicz's looping textures reign in McGee's more excessive tendencies as, amidst all the chance happenings and bombardments, a directional line will emerge moving towards a cohesive structure, centering the composition with McGee's squabbling sweeps and chattering seeming less reckless and more integral to the overall fabric. Fascinating and recommended!\n\n- PBK, Killing Birds, May 2012.",

      "about": "From Electronic Cottage Magazine, Issue Six:\n\nHal's Trip to Miami\n\n\n\nOn Friday, April 19th of this year (1991) I took a greyhound bus to the Miami, Florida area to visit and hang out with some of the indie electronic musicians of the region. I stayed with James Garcia, better known as Dimthingshine, at his home in Miramar. Friday evenings activities started off with a dinner party at the Beirut Lebanese restaurant. Present were King Felix . Ed Bobb (former member of the Happiness Boys), Isaac Ersoff (an artist you'll be hearing a lot more of in the future, with numerous whacked-out avant garde solo works, plus his bass playing in the group Scraping Teeth with DTS on drums and Rat Bastard on guitar) and his lovely and talented wife Resa, James and myself. Over cups of Turkish coffee, glasses of ouzo and wine , plus an array of tasty foods such as stuffed grape leaves, baba ghanoush, hummus and falafel--there was even a belly dancer for our entertainment!--we discussed electronic music , our favorite artists, issues of indie music culture and our favorite mind-altering substances. Later came a recording session at ESYNC Studio that lasted till the wee hours of the morning. Saturday morning I interviewed Dimthingshine for an upcoming issue of EC. On Saturday afternoon there was another get together and recording session at Frank P.'s house (Frank runs the Antebellum label and records as Anemic Cinema) with me, James, Isaac and Frank. Later that night , after dinner at an excellent Indian restaurant, James and I recorded a few pieces in his Thingsflux studio. I had a great time and can't wait to go back!\n\n\n\nSide A\n\n1.

      "about": "a cassette collage collaboration\n\nby factor X and Hal McGee\n\n\n\nabout the factor X source tape:\n\n\n\nThe tape was recorded straight from beginning to end no pauses, it was meant to be a sister tape to one I did around the same time called Roh.\n\nI was doing lots of stuff using my voice at the time, 1989/90. The idea\n\nwas kind of to lift the lid off the subconscious mind, that somewhere\n\nbeyond this stream of nonsense something dwelt. It was a concept now matched. Completed maybe.\n\n\n\nHal McGee recorded his cassette on a handheld recorder in March 2013 - conversations with two friends, Jiblit Dupree and Hollis Smith, lunch at a Chinese fast food restaurant, and at a local grocery store, plus spoken thoughts, and other sounds of daily life.\n\n\n\nWithout listening to either tape first, McGee improvised a mix of the\n\ntapes (inspired by simultaneist chance procedures) and created two\n\ncollages of shifting textures, contrasts, potential meanings, utterly joyful non-sense, and happy accidents that are negotiated by listeners through active listening.\n\n\n\nHistory of factor X (1983/1994) as remembered \n\ncompletelyunknown.bandcamp.com/album/history-of-factor-x-1983-1994-as-remembered",

      "about": "F5 (1996)\n\nBeagle and Dachshund (2008)\n\nA Young Person's Guide To Experimental Electronic Music (2007)\n\n\n\nF5\n\nCrunchy noisy layers of field recordings of a huge trash compactor and an intrusion alarm horn with insertions of answering machine noises and messages, phone conversations, and a special spoken message from me to Joe Roemer of Macronympha. F5 was originally released on cassette on the HalTapes label in 1996.\n\n\n\nBeagle and Dachshund\n\nCassette & microcassette recordings of sounds from Hal's daily life, circuit bent Casio SK-1, and other machine noises. 2008.\n\n\n\nA Young Person's Guide To Experimental Electronic Music\n\nRecorded in November 2007 by Hal McGee in his home studio in Gainesville, Florida. It is a 46-minute free form abstract minimal synthesizer piece created on a Fostex X-12 four-track cassette recorder, employing the following gear: Custom Black Edition Little Boy Blue analog synthesizer [by Flower Electronics], Technosaurus Microcon analog synthesizer, Moog Micromoog analog synthesizer (on loan from Jay Peele), circuit bent Casio Rapman [bent by Daniel Park], circuit bent Casio SK-1, Alesis Microverb III digital reverb (used during mastering/mixdown), and Behringer Eurorack UB802 mixer (for EQ and volume adjustments during mastering/mixdown). Mixed down directly to CDR, on a stand-alone RCA CDRW140 CD Recorder. The unique idiosyncratic character of this recording is due in great part to the cassette medium and the Fostex machine on which the raw materials were recorded. I used no outboard effects such as delay, distortion or reverb during the creation of the four raw tracks. The Fostex 4-track lends to this music an unmistakable colorful tape distortion which couldn't be found on more expensive and/or digital gear. I am proud of this piece of work and there is not a lot of this kind of highly-idealistic electronic music being produced these days.",

      "about": "a microcassette duo collaboration\n\nrecorded in Germany and Florida December 2012\n\n\n\nreview @ Vital Weekly : STIRNER & HAL MCGEE - MICRO MEANIES (cassette by Haltapes) Four pieces, around fifteen minutes each of improvisations recorded through mail using a vast array of sound sources (synthesizers, radios, kazoo, crackle box, harmonica, toy piano to mention some; entire list on the cover of this release) but where the title refers to the medium it was recorded on, the micro cassette. Veteran home taper Hal McGee, who has been around for thirty or so years in the world of cassette labels and experimental electronics teams up with one of the younger kids, Tony Stirner, who started out as a heavy noise man, but in the mean time also went 'softer'. This tape proofs that, and is another point of evidence how these sort of collaborations are often created. Let's have four pieces of fifteen minutes and let's use a random selection of sounds thrown together in that duration and cut away in a crude form what we don't need in the mix. Or let's mix with blindfolds - providing of course there is analogue mixer somewhere around. Like a stream of un/sub/consciousness this is wheels set in motion and wait around for any possible action to happen. Sometimes all at once - and then wait for the noise bomb to drop - or all alone, just by themselves, and we find both in a more subdued mood, but the microcassette is not a medium that captures moods lightly. It always stays on the noisy side, even in the quieter moments. Sixty minutes is perhaps a bit long, but that too is part of the whole game/esthetics of this.

      "about": "A Statistician's Intramural Crush is a collaboration by Crank Sturgeon and Hal McGee consisting of field recordings, minimalist instrumentation, improvisational textures, stream of consciousness spoken word mind glop, and lo-fi gloriosity. Tape on tape on tape on tape with hissy lump thrill peaks, stringy whack, numbers, ensue the wondermint of 3 point 5. If you are looking for adventure in sound you will here it hear. Reel to unreal.\n\n\n\nCrank Sturgeon recorded his sounds this way:\n\nSony brand ECM-MS907 mic\n\nconnected to RCA brand RP3538R microcassette recorder w/ ext. mic input\n\n\"Karen\" violin to\n\nReel to Reel player (Sound Pacer brand)\n\nto AIWA microcassette players\n\nfancy iPod FX\n\n\n\nHal McGee recorded his sounds in February 2013 on a Sony M-470 microcassette recorder, and on March 7, 2013, he improvised a mix of Crank Sturgeon's tape with his tape without listening to Crank's tape first.\n\n\n\nLetter from Hal McGee to Crank Sturgeon, March 7, 2013:\n\n\n\n True to the sprit of the project, I did not listen to your tape before doing the improvised mix of our two tapes.\n\n Not only that, I didn't open up the protective packaging around your tape until just before doing the mix. You can imagine my surprise and alarm to see that the top of your lil microcassette tape was crushed! Yikes! Little pieces of plastic crumbled and fell off of the top edge of the tape shell as I took it out of its wrapper.\n\n I trusted the microcassette gods, however, and forged ahead.\n\n I loaded your tape into one microcassette player and mine into one of an identical model. After about one minute your tape stopped. More yikes.\n\n I remained patient and trusting. I rewound your tape and tried again.\n\n The mix sounded wondrous indeed. I was greatly pleased. At about 25 minutes into mixing the A-sides of the tapes your tape stopped playing again.\n\n I decided that I had better get Side B mixed before your tape completely disintegrated. Flipped your tape over, rewound to the beginning of Side B, did the same with mine, and improvised/witnessed another splendid audio experience. There are many magical moments where it all comes together so nicely and sounds pre-composed, intended to sound that way. Really quite successful in my opinion! In any case, your Side B went all the way to the end of the side, which for some odd reason only comes to 28:00 instead of 30:00. Hm. It didn't sound like your tape was fast, speeded-up, chipmunked.",

I purposely made a lot of space in the sounds so that you can add your sounds. Please remix, mangle, layer, destroy, chop up, or do a straight one-to-one collaboration with my sounds. When you post your mix online, let me know where it is and I will link to it in the Comments on this page. Recorded directly to Audacity on Wednesday morning October 31, 2012. WAV file download.",

For many years I'd been using them in my live improvisations (usually playing back recordings made on the way to gigs) but in my rush to embrace the high quality of recordings made possible with computers, I'd rather neglected the instant, fun, quality of the hand-held device. This came back to me after I watched a performance of Hal making an extraordinary racket with two dictaphones on YouTube.\n\n\n\nThe other aspect that appealed to me was the chance to record the mundane, and the instant inspiration. As a young teenager I'd once tried to record on cassette the atmosphere of various rooms in parent's house (including a not particularly successful attempt to record the cupboard under the stairs!) and this project allowed me the chance to instantly record a sound that appealed to me, without having to go through the rigmarole of selecting a good mic, setting up the stand, setting recording levels, tuning up, making test recordings etc etc. So if I wanted to record a plastic flute in the acoustics of the bathroom I did - instantly. Of course the sound is tinny, painfully so at times and an hour may be a lot to ask of a listener, but I hope it's varied enough to keep your interest. I can't wait to hear what Hal has come up with.\n\n\n\nOne final technical note - although the recordings are generally in chronological order, I have dropped in some sounds later over sequences I thought a little too long.\n\n\n\n-Richard Sanderson November 2012\n\n\n\nHal McGee Sound Sources and Objects\n\n-- recorded with a Sony M-470 microcassette recorder\n\n\n\nvoice\n\nhumbucker magnetic pickup and contact mic\n\nfeedback modulation\n\ngarbage can lid\n\ncell phone ringing\n\ncigar box diddley bow\n\nunplugged electric guitar\n\nordering chicken sandwiches and fries\n\nemergency vehicle sirens & horns\n\nautomatic teller machine\n\ngrocery store checkout\n\nvuvuzela\n\nencounter with neighbor while walking dog\n\nbird chirping\n\nmotor vehicle sounds\n\ntoy & hobby shop\n\nHohner Pocket Pal harmonica\n\nHohner tremolo harmonica\n\ndog barking\n\nHohner mini keychain harmonica\n\nKohala baritone ukulele\n\ngarden talk\n\nArmy ROTC personnel chanting and running\n\nMonotron synth\n\nMark McGee: contact mic and washboard",

They stood outside the cake shop and hoped for excitement. They were two guys with hundreds of missiles in their hearts and a huge appetite for destruction and noise. Together they directed their mental energy toward the cake shop. It burst into flames. Rafael and Hal jumped up and down for joy and excitement. Then they felt hungry and reached into the broken window of the shop, snatched two cakes and walked away laughing and singing, playing harmonicas and noisemakers, in between bites of cake.",

The road was paved around either side, creating quite an unusual scene. Imagine cars careening down the highway, swerving around the house, tires squealing.\n\nB1, \"Guódào\", means \"national road.\" Night has fallen; so has the house of Baogen. The highway is filled with twinkling headlights. Travelers speed desperately, their ephedrinated consciousness tenuously holding on to wakefulness as they push on to their destinations. Visions of creation and destruction mix with the intoxicating odor of petrol fumes.\n\n\n\nTrevor Luke: \n\nLittle Boy Blue analog synth, Moog MF-107 FreqBox, Moog MF-102 Ring Modulator, Korg Kaoss Pad, Korg Monotribe, Arturia MiniBrute\n\n\n\nHal McGee:\n\nKorg Monotribe, Korg Monotron, Moog MF-104 Analog Delay, Moog Rogue, Moog MF-107 FreqBox \n\n\n\nA1 and B1 recorded December 28, 2012, on a Tascam DP-004 4-Track Digital PocketStudio.\n\nA2 recorded December 20, 2012 on video, mp4 audio.\n\nB2 recorded March 2, 2013, direct to stereo cassette.\n\nAll tracks recorded in Gainesville, Florida.",

Jeff Surak sent to me a 62 minute microcassette of turntablist and electroacoustic sounds and I mixed with it my own 62 minute microcassette of shortwave radio and circuit bent electronics. Together we created two 31-minute stream of consciousness collages replete with happy accidents, strangeness, and crunchy, fun lo-fi sound happenings.\n\n\n\nI have known Jeff Surak since the mid 1980s, when he recorded as 1348 and as a member of New Carrollton, and operated the Watergate Tapes label. In recent years he has recorded as Violet, operates the Zeromoon label of awesome experimental sounds, and produces the yearly famous Sonic Circuits Festival in Washington, D.C.\n\nThis is our first collaboration!\n\n\n\ncontact J.

Anyone and everyone was invited to leave a one minute message of any sounds they wanted on Hal McGee's microcassette answering machine.\n\n\n\nMcGee collected 21 one-hour tapes of messages. Message content ranges from ultra-mundane to random thoughts and musings to the scandalous, suicidal and erotic and murderous confessions. The content of the tapes was solely determined by the contributors, and their messages are presented here without editing, in the order that they were received. This is the seventh one-hour tape. \n\n\n\nParticipants were invited to: \n\nCall the Automatic Confessional answering machine at 352-336-7915 and leave a one minute message of any words, thoughts, sounds, and noises. Anybody and everybody can participate! \n\n\n\n(Please note that the telephone number is no longer in service) \n\n\n\nHere is the original project description and project guidelines: \n\n\n\nYou are invited to telephone my microcassette answering machine and leave a message of one minute in length. Your message can be as short as you like - only a few seconds in length if you wish. \n\n\n\nAbsolutely anybody and everybody can participate. \n\n\n\nYour telephone will connect with the machine after a few seconds (you will probably hear two rings before it connects). Then you will hear a short spoken pre-recorded message from me, and will be instructed to leave your message after a long beep sound. \n\n\n\nThe telephone number is 352 336 7915 \n\n\n\nAt one minute you will hear a beep sound which indicates that the machine has stopped recording. \n\n\n\nThis is not my personal telephone number, and it is being used solely for the Automatic Confessional project. \n\n\n\nYou are allowed to leave a message of any sort, of any sounds, or words, or thoughts that you choose, with absolutely no restrictions on content. \n\n\n\nState your name in the message if you want people to know who it is and want to be credited for the message. \n\n\n\nYou may leave a message anonymously. \n\n\n\nYou can leave as many messages as you want and there are no restrictions on how often you leave a message, but try to show restraint and do not overdo it. The idea is to get as many different people involved as possible. \n\n\n\nI will not edit or restrict or censor the messages in any way. I want you to understand the full implications of what this means. I will allow any form of expression, no matter how offensive, objectionable, or tasteless -- this includes hate speech, racism, sexism, ageism, etc. This does not mean that I personally condone or approve of or agree with any content of any of the messages. \n\n\n\nThe answering machine tapes will be published online and will be available to the public. You are entirely responsible for the content of your messages. Think twice before you leave a message which may be personally embarrassing or compromising to you or someone else or which is slanderous, libelous, inflammatory, or hateful. Once I publish the tapes on the Internet the sounds you make in your message will be able to be heard by anyone forever. I will not remove your message from the tape - do not ask me to do so. You have been warned. Any regrets will be yours -- not mine. \n\n\n\nI can see this as an ongoing project that will evolve and change over time. Automatic Confessional will operate with the same lo-fi conceptual and fluxus spirit as my Dictaphonia Microcassette Compilation Project but will be more open-ended and free form. \n\n\n\nI am looking for a lot of variety in the messages, style-, content-, and mood-wise, a big grab bag audio trash heap collage. \n\n\n\nHere are some keywords, suggestions, possibilities and random thoughts about what you could contribute: \n\n\n\nrants, weird little sound effects, cryptic voice messages, funny, sexy, surreal, paranoid, confessions, word cut-ups, short sermons, speeches and essays, recordings from your answering machine, hate messages, haiku, circuit bent sounds, conspiracy talk, tell the machine your hopes and fears, pranks, jokes, static, buzzing, feedback of various sorts, dream recollections, confess your sins, lo tech electronic sounds, political statements, little poems and stories, just any random thoughts that come to your mind, commentary about the Automatic Confessional project, miniature instrumentals, stream of consciousness, you could make no sound if you wish, fortune cookie fortunes, field recordings as they happen through your cell phone, street musicians, drug addicts, fistfights, sporting events, insane lunatic ravings, drunken ramblings, conversations, college class lectures, arguments, aphorisms, love-making sounds, sounds of urination and defecation, belching, farting, coughing, sneezing, hiccuping, stomach-rumbling, sounds of children and pets, machine sounds of all sorts, automobile sounds, public transportation sounds, subway, trains, buses, taxis, tunnels, interstate highways, industrial and factory sounds, advertisements, sounds from markets and shops and stores and restaurants and slaughterhouses, political protests, riots, demonstrations, townhall meetings, carnivals, circus, street preachers, drug and weapons deals going down, police raids, emergency and police sirens, telephones ringing, ringtones, alarms, clocks, doorbells, windmills, oil derricks, underpasses, abandoned ruined buildings, haunted houses, UFO sightings, other paranormal phenomena including EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), avatars, ghosts, seances, baptisms, table-tapping, church services, television and radio sounds, talk shows, video game sounds, rainstorms, thunder, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, sounds of war, sounds of death and dying and conception and birth, folk songs, anthems, toys, banjo and guitar picking and strumming, trumpet, flugelhorn, shruti box, harmonium, drums, beating on boxes and metal and found objects, your own little raps and jam sessions, jug-blowing music, kazoos, whistles, harmonicas, flutes, tell me what you think of me, sarcastic remarks, business meetings, conferences, prisons and jails, Hare Krishna chanting, seagulls, tugboats, paddlewheel boats, cruise ships, motorboats, sounds of fishing, clamming, and oystering, hunting sounds, guns, rifle ranges, helicopters, elevators, 78 RPM records, wire recordings, discarded tapes and CDs found on the street, dumpster-diving sounds, sounds of landfills and dumps, sounds from ancient Troy, sounds of surgery, amputations, guillotinings, beheadings, drawing and quartering, torture sounds, sounds of deviant practices, rubber bands, sex toys, the most boring sound ever, the most exciting sound ever, the most annoying sound ever, recite your grocery list, sounds of model trains, sounds of hammers, saws, crowbars, and other tools, crows, owls, birdsongs, cats, dogs, elephants, lions, coyotes, bears, wolves, cockfights, turkey gobbling, pigs grunting, mass suicides, archaeological digs, beer-drinking songs, sea shanties, kung fu fighting, karate chops, samurai swords clanging, graveyard sounds, skulls and bones rattling, interviews with vampires, Goths, Metal Kids, politicians, nursing home residents, street vendors, prophets, mystics, gurus, shamans, etc. \n\n\n\nThis project is in no way connected or affiliated with the Catholic Church or any other religious or political institution, such as the Masons or the U.S. government. \n\n\n\nThe Automatic Confessional project started at 12:00 PM on Wednesday, August 19, 2009 \n\n\n\nHal McGee",

You will leave your messages on the voicemail of my cell phone. I will transfer these messages to microcassette via playback through my cell phone's earpiece. Then I will transfer the microcassette tapes to Audacity and then publish a tape online every time that I receive enough messages to fill up a 60 minute tape.\n\nSame basic concept, though!",

      "about": "Dead Hand Decision is a microcassette duo collaboration by Dave Fuglewicz and Hal McGee. Fuglewicz and McGee each recorded 62 minutes of sounds (VST and analog synths, office machines, sounds of everyday life) on microcassettes. McGee then created two rough and raw improvised collage mixes of about 31 minutes each. Recorded October 2012.\n\n\n\nDave Fuglewicz says:\n\n\n\nI accepted Hal's micro-cassette collaboration invitation with a jubilant and justified gusto. Alas, I had just put a vast and weighty hurt upon the muscles of my back and was more or less confined to the rigors of either a desk chair, whether at home or at work, or my bed. The pain I was feeling prompted me to not be very adventurous in my choice of recording settings, mainly confining it to my computer speakers at my desk. Though I did capture a bit of the office machinery monsters where I work. Recently I had discovered an intriguing VST called Phasm2 by Eric Langou, and I used that for the majority of the sounds I made for the collaboration. I also pulled out some of my trusty, old-school free-standing software synths, Rollosonic, Granulab and Synthia to round my sounds out. Hal took what I recorded, added his own audio wizardry and produced this micro-masterpiece; \"Dead Hand Decision\". It is a stupendous example of artistic synergy, the whole being light years greater than the component pieces. \n\nI had a blast doing this and I know you will enjoy it with extreme pleasure. Volume: turn it up to eleven.",

      "about": "The Exploitation of Jiblit Dupree is a comedic concept album produced and recorded by Hal McGee, consisting of Jiblit's voicemails, audio ripped from videos, and a telephone conversation, mixed together with improvisations by Canned Ham, all recorded in inglorious lo-fi filth on microcassette. The album features original stories, songs, poems, and routines created by Jiblit Dupree -- a veritable surfeit of tongue-in-cheek redneck humor addressing subjects ranging from cornbred misogyny to drug abuse to Jiblit's alternative careers as NASCAR and drag racing drivers and as a porno actor, sex with UFO aliens, depression, alcoholism, murder, death, fried chicken, love/hate passive-aggressive musings on Hal McGee's exploitation of Jiblit, and much much more. Excess is the operative word here.\n\nin their review of \"The Exploitation of Jiblit Dupree\" the New York Times said that \"this album reveals the rotten worm-infested underbelly of post-capitalist America, and Jiblit Dupree is the redneck Salvador Dalí, every bit as feverishly obsessive\".\n\n\n\n--------\n\n\n\nJiblit's messages contain references to these notable persons, places, events n stuff: Jay Peele, New World Brewery, Chickenhead, Pablo Escobar, Ybor City, New York City, Portland Oregon, Crosby Stills & Nash, George Bush (either/both), idiots in the Internet World, a duck and a bartender, a pastor accused of sex allegations, Polk City, Jamison Williams, love bugs, Billy Joe Bob McGee, the Voicemail Lady at Verizon Wireless, Old Dickjammer, The Fluffer, Tampa, Ronny Elliott, The Castle, goth girls, Jack Kerouac, (sing-along with) Can, Rajun Cajun, Rat Bastard (Laundry Room Squelchers), Uncle Lou's, Jimi Hendrix, Orlando, Guided By Voices, (Leftoverture by) Kansas, Jane Jane Pollock, DeLuna Fest, The Second Coming, Jiblit's brother Buford, multiple uvulas, Mason jars, shotgun, pickup truck, Maker's Mark, Noise Celebrity Golf Tournament, Disney World, snow white Canadian belly, Mama says Jiblit better go pick that cotton",

Centipede Farmer recorded 60 minutes of sounds on a microcassette in June and July 2012 and mailed the tape to McGee, who recorded 60 minutes of sounds in July and August. Without listening to either source tape first, McGee then mixed Centipede's tape with his and improvised a simple mix, with a minimal amount of panning, directly to Audacity, on Sunday, August 5, 2012. The two 31-minute collages were then split into a total of nine separate tracks.\n\n\n\nCentipede Farmer lives in West Des Moines, Iowa, USA\n\nHal McGee lives in Gainesville, Florida, USA\n\n\n\nHere is a list of Centipede Farmer's sound sources:\n\n\n\n- Mixtape Alpha played through computer speakers at my work\n\n- Answering machine messages to and from my dad, 1990s sometime\n\n- Cicadas in tree outside my apartment, and passing traffic\n\n- Me improvising on acoustic guitar while my wife Leah and her friend Dan reminisce\n\n- My dad's microcassette notes to my mom on business matters, during a home inspection, 1990s\n\n- Can and bottle crusher machines at the Valley West Hy-Vee\n\n- Mixtape Alpha and Monotron Duo jam through computer speakers on my deck with cicadas in the background, interrupted by Leah\n\n- My son Wesley playing with toy monster trucks in the dirt\n\n- Wesley whining about something random, then being tickled\n\n- The voice response system of my credit union on payday\n\n- Bedroom sludge jam on Casio SA-21 drums & bass guitar with looper & effects\n\n- Me and my old buddy Zeke goofing off at a gig, early 2000s\n\n- Me reading weird spam discussion board robo-posts\n\n- Bedroom no-input mixer jam\n\n- Old recording of a couple guys jamming on drums and slide banjo in Cedar Falls, early 2000s\n\n- Bedroom space noise jam with old 4-track tape, tape-scratching, Casio SA-21, looper & effects\n\n- Wesley watching videos of monster trucks on the iPad\n\n- My friend Chris rambling drunkenly about my thin comedy material and something political, early 2000s\n\n- Me playing an increasingly deconstructed version of \"Return to Sender\" on acoustic guitar\n\n- Cop Bar performing the song \"I was curious who would fix the Sewers after Society Collapsed so I Voted for Ron Paul\" at The Space For Ames\n\n- Another bedroom jam with looper and Casio SA-21\n\n- My sister Sarah giggling while her late dog Shadow growls at something, early 2000s\n\n\n\nHere is a list of Hal McGee's sound sources:\n\n\n\n- sounds from Action Research show #93, July 26, 2012, at Display, Gainesville, Florida, including the voices of Dan Reaves, Andrew Chadwick, Frog and others, and excerpts from performances by Frog and C.A.N.S.\n\n- cardboard compactor machine, various alarms, Automatic Teller Machine sounds, dog squeaky toys\n\n- sounds from my job, including the voices of co-workers: they like it on the bottom; I sure am glad we get paid next week; I’m gonna give her an in-service; I’m gonna be a diva; like a popsicle on a stick; like a biscuit sopping up gravy; pot, wine, liquor - it’s not a problem as long as it doesn’t cause a problem; how does that work, that the mother is younger than the son?; better quit smokin’ that dope; my nuts fell on the floor; my smoked sausage is bun-size\n\n- jams on Yamaha PSS-470, Casio MT-47, circuit bent Casio SK-1, and rubber band\n\n- ordering and paying for food and coffee at various restaurants, cafeterias, coffee shops, and grocery stores, including cash register sounds\n\n- talking to people at the bus stop before work, and neighbors\n\n- sending packages at the post office and complaining about the post office\n\n- sounds inside my pants pocket and brushing my teeth\n\n- excerpts from a jam session with Mark McGee on drums, A.J.

      "about": "I recorded the sounds on \"one week in the life of a microcassette\" on a 60 minute microcassette tape from Thursday, September 6th through Wednesday, September 12th, 2012. This tape is loaded with sounds from my daily life, and features the sounds of my Wazoogle (made by Kazoobie Kazoos) - pictured on the cover, it is a kazoo with bell and bugle attachments - several improvisations, sonatas, and fantasias for the instrument are included on this album - including it being played with electronics. On this tape you will also hear my dog, me talking to my dog, sounds from my job, grocery stores, restaurants, coffee shops, two jams on Monotrons with Wazoogle, my neighborhood, machines, spoken words on various thoughts (including my 'golden rule' for choosing a musical instrument), electronic sounds, rustling and crinkling - all recorded in lo-fi low budget glory via the built-in condenser microphone on my Sony M-470 microcassette recorder. Pull up a comfortable chair, and let me entertain you. The second track features the most Wazoogle, including a kazoo duet with a co-worker at my job.",

      "about": "Dog Food is a minimalist, random, chance process composition from 1986, consisting of four tracks of sounds from a friend of mine, Toby O'Brien, playing a Commodore 64 computer baseball game. The use of lo fi lo tech electronic consumer product sound samples prefigures much of my work from 2005 onward. Originally released on cassette in 1986, C20, on the Cause And Effect label.\n\n\n\nfrom the January 1988 Cause And Effect catalog:\n\nAn interesting concept tape, a cut-up collage of electronic junk. Unique and a definite collector's item for the hardcore DAM fan.\n\n\n\n\"Sparse electronic run-away mod noise funk\", Robin James, Sound Choice.\n\n\n\n\"An enjoyable listen; one that makes you smile\", Scott Colburn, Blow It Off.\n\n\n\nThe cover is a modified Frito's brand Corn Chips bag. The cover and tape came in a zip-lock plastic pouch.\n\n\n\nThe cover was originally printed on orange paper",

      "about": "Connection Cassette Compilation #3 was originally released in June 2012. The original version of this compilation (still available) was issued on cassette. All contributors received a copy of the compilation on the same cassette on which they sent their contribution.\n\n\n\nAs much as possible, this cassette compilation project has been done in the original spirit of the 1980s cassette art scene. \n\n\n\nThe audio versions here were taken directly from the original contributor tapes and are higher sound quality than on the cassette copies that were issued, because there is not two generation loss in sound from contributor copy to cassette master to distributed copy. Be sure to download the full size album artwork and print your own cover. The cover artwork layout is a collage of bits and pieces and scraps from the contributor packages and letters. \n\n\n\nSide A of the C90 cassette, tracks 1-12 \n\nSide B, tracks 13-25\n\n\n\nOn March 26, 2012 I made this announcement:\n\n\n\nConnection Cassette Compilation Project - 2012\n\nan international compilation project produced by Hal McGee\n\n\n\nAny and all styles are welcome!

A Beatnik bongo poem live performance, Monotron improvisations, a circuit bent Casio SK-1 jam, canjo and diddley bow instrumentals, sounds from my daily life, all in their mundane lo-fi glory. The track titles describe what you will hear! The original hour-long tape has been divided into 35 separate tracks. The volume levels of some of the instrumental tracks have been boosted a bit. Also included here are straight transcriptions of the two 30 minute sides of tape.",

      "about": "Jiblit Dupree and Hal McGee Love You is a collection of 18 new songs and instrumentals combining trailer trash country, blues, noise, punk, and comedy into a blend that sounds quite unlike anything else. Recorded Saturday, June 9, 2012, at Hal McGee's apartment in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n\n\nIf you are easily offended by raunchy lyrical content of highly questionable humorous redneck taste, go no further than reading this description. Themes treated in the songs include monster trucks, miscarriages, drunken poorly-aimed sex, lust for midget Down's Syndrome girls, Beach Boys send-ups, stipulations, Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler, Abraham Lincoln, Barack Obama, Walt Disney, Salvador Dali, hate on a personal and universal level, disdain for environmentalism and New Age \"philosophy\", Pony Bones, death, Noise Scene orthodoxy, The Sex Pistols with a Dachshund sing-along, abortion, Black Flag, prostitution, um - did I mention tongue in cheek misogyny?, alcoholism (duh), marital discord and divorce, more death and misogyny, gallows humor, and on and on.\n\n\n\nFile Under: Comedy, Noise, Country & Western, Electronic\n\n\n\nRecorded on a Zoom H-2 digital recorder.\n\n\n\nAlbum cover photo by Kyle McGee, taken on Hal McGee's porch, while rain poured outside.\n\n\n\nDownload the album to view additional photos from the session.",

      "about": "Big Audio Scrap Heap was a self-produced compact disc by Hal McGee, recorded and originally released in 2001 on the F.D.R. Recordings label, subsequently by HalTapes. Big Audio Scrap Heap was Part Two of a trilogy of CDs called My Intellectual Property. This noise-trash-monster of an album was constructed on a 4-track cassette recorder with dense layers of handheld cassette recordings of urban noise, everyday sounds, and shortwave radio tones and static in an audio ethnographic sensory overload collage. Big Audio Scrap Heap is meant to be experienced as one continuous 72 minute audiowork. It is, however, divided up into 19 tracks of arbitrary length. The listener can play the tracks in straight sequence or in shuffle mode for varying effects.",

      "about": "Connection Cassette Compilation #4 was originally released in July 2012. The original version of this compilation (still available) was issued on cassette. All contributors received a copy of the compilation on the same cassette on which they sent their contribution.\n\n\n\nAs much as possible, this cassette compilation project has been done in the original spirit of the 1980s cassette art scene. \n\n\n\nThe audio versions here were taken directly from the original contributor tapes and are higher sound quality than on the cassette copies that were issued, because there is not two generation loss in sound from contributor copy to cassette master to distributed copy. Be sure to download the full size album artwork and print your own cover. The cover artwork layout is a collage of bits and pieces and scraps from the contributor packages and letters. \n\n\n\nSide A of the C90 cassette, tracks 1-11 \n\nSide B, tracks 12-23 \n\n\n\nOn March 26, 2012 I made this announcement: \n\n\n\nConnection Cassette Compilation Project - 2012 \n\nan international compilation project produced by Hal McGee \n\n\n\nAny and all styles are welcome!

      "about": "Connection Cassette Compilation #1 was originally released in April 2011. The original version of this compilation (still available) was issued on cassette. All contributors received a copy of the compilation on the same cassette on which they sent their contribution.\n\n\n\nAs much as possible, this cassette compilation project has been done in the original spirit of the 1980s cassette art scene.\n\n\n\nThe audio versions here were taken directly from the original contributor tapes and are higher sound quality than on the cassette copies that were issued, because there is not two generation loss in sound from contributor copy to cassette master to distributed copy. Be sure to download the full size album artwork and print your own cover. The cover artwork layout is a collage of bits and pieces and scraps from the contributor packages and letters.\n\n\n\nSide A of the C90 cassette, tracks 1-11\n\nSide B, tracks 12-22\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\n\nOn March 26, 2012 I made this announcement:\n\n\n\nConnection Cassette Compilation Project - 2012\n\nan international compilation project produced by Hal McGee\n\n\n\nAny and all styles are welcome!

      "about": "Nature Guy: recordings from Key West, Florida\n\n\n\nTwo 31-minute cassette tape noise collages of field recordings from Key West, Florida, September 30-October 2, 2011. Most of these recordings were made on Duval Street. I carried with me two identical Sony TCM-150 cassette recorders, one in either pocket of my cargo pants. I would pull one out, record certain sounds in my surroundings, put it back and pull out the other recorder and record new sounds, over and over. Sometimes I would pull out both recorders and record at the same time, with slight variations. Later, I mixed the two tapes together in an arbitrary purposely haphazard manner.\n\n\n\nAs I was recording the raw source materials I was struck by the feeling that in that hyper-detailed, over-the-top, too-much-information environment of Key West (which is as far out on the edge of the USA as possible) I was in a sense immersed or swimming in everything that is good and bad and exciting and boring about living in a mixed market Capitalist society that is teetering and tottering, collapsing and yet bursting forth...\n\n\n\nRelated to this album, which was recorded the same weekend: \n\nhalmcgee.bandcamp.com/album/30-cent-walk-in-dewey-broken-back-clinic",

      "about": "Minimalist free improvisation by Keith Nicolay of Post Prandials and Hal McGee. Recorded at Keith's apartment on 65th Street in Brooklyn, May 1 and 2, 1997.\n\n\n\nKeith got out a couple of electric guitars, an amp, his flute and some coins, balls, a drinking glass, silverware and various other household\n\nitems to \"prepare\" the instruments. During the hour-long session I laid on my belly. I scraped, plucked, rubbed, thumped the guitar strings and the pickups. Keith played snatches of flute melodies, plucked & strummed guitar, and spun bits of records & CDs (by John Cage & others). At one point on the tape you can hear the rainstorm through Keith's open window.\n\n\n\nKeith remarked that it sounded like a lounge band toiling away, huddled over their instruments on a small, dimly lit stage in the back of a hotel lounge. A race of aliens had crash-landed on one of Jupiter's moons. The survivors knew that it would be 40 years until a relief party came to their rescue. These people, the Micronians, loved music, and since they were to be marooned for a long time they set about making music. Two plucky Micronians, Myxylplyxyt & Ryxylyplyxyt, decided to take on the task of playing & composing music music for the others, even though they had never played music before.\n\n\n\nThe next morning we recorded another 15 minutes. Keith played some of the tape I'd done with L.G. Mair (6J) on a cassette deck, while we beat on an old non-operational Fender Rhodes electric piano. We laid the guitars on top of the piano to let them catch the vibrations.",

      "about": "The Automatic Confessional was a project created and curated by Hal McGee from August 19, 2009 through March 2, 2010. Anyone and everyone was invited to leave a one minute message of any sounds they wanted on Hal McGee's microcassette answering machine.\n\n\n\nMcGee collected 21 one-hour tapes of messages. Message content ranges from ultra-mundane to random thoughts and musings to the scandalous, suicidal and erotic and murderous confessions. The content of the tapes was solely determined by the contributors, and their messages are presented here without editing, in the order that they were received. \n\n\n\nParticipants were invited to: \n\nCall the Automatic Confessional answering machine at 352-336-7915 and leave a one minute message of any words, thoughts, sounds, and noises. Anybody and everybody can participate! \n\n\n\n(Please note that the telephone number is no longer in service) \n\n\n\nHere is the original project description and project guidelines: \n\n\n\nYou are invited to telephone my microcassette answering machine and leave a message of one minute in length. Your message can be as short as you like - only a few seconds in length if you wish. \n\n\n\nAbsolutely anybody and everybody can participate. \n\n\n\nYour telephone will connect with the machine after a few seconds (you will probably hear two rings before it connects). Then you will hear a short spoken pre-recorded message from me, and will be instructed to leave your message after a long beep sound. \n\n\n\nThe telephone number is 352 336 7915 \n\n\n\nAt one minute you will hear a beep sound which indicates that the machine has stopped recording. \n\n\n\nThis is not my personal telephone number, and it is being used solely for the Automatic Confessional project. \n\n\n\nYou are allowed to leave a message of any sort, of any sounds, or words, or thoughts that you choose, with absolutely no restrictions on content. \n\n\n\nState your name in the message if you want people to know who it is and want to be credited for the message. \n\n\n\nYou may leave a message anonymously. \n\n\n\nYou can leave as many messages as you want and there are no restrictions on how often you leave a message, but try to show restraint and do not overdo it. The idea is to get as many different people involved as possible. \n\n\n\nI will not edit or restrict or censor the messages in any way. I want you to understand the full implications of what this means. I will allow any form of expression, no matter how offensive, objectionable, or tasteless -- this includes hate speech, racism, sexism, ageism, etc. This does not mean that I personally condone or approve of or agree with any content of any of the messages. \n\n\n\nThe answering machine tapes will be published online and will be available to the public. You are entirely responsible for the content of your messages. Think twice before you leave a message which may be personally embarrassing or compromising to you or someone else or which is slanderous, libelous, inflammatory, or hateful. Once I publish the tapes on the Internet the sounds you make in your message will be able to be heard by anyone forever. I will not remove your message from the tape - do not ask me to do so. You have been warned. Any regrets will be yours -- not mine. \n\n\n\nI can see this as an ongoing project that will evolve and change over time. Automatic Confessional will operate with the same lo-fi conceptual and fluxus spirit as my Dictaphonia Microcassette Compilation Project but will be more open-ended and free form. \n\n\n\nI am looking for a lot of variety in the messages, style-, content-, and mood-wise, a big grab bag audio trash heap collage. \n\n\n\nHere are some keywords, suggestions, possibilities and random thoughts about what you could contribute: \n\n\n\nrants, weird little sound effects, cryptic voice messages, funny, sexy, surreal, paranoid, confessions, word cut-ups, short sermons, speeches and essays, recordings from your answering machine, hate messages, haiku, circuit bent sounds, conspiracy talk, tell the machine your hopes and fears, pranks, jokes, static, buzzing, feedback of various sorts, dream recollections, confess your sins, lo tech electronic sounds, political statements, little poems and stories, just any random thoughts that come to your mind, commentary about the Automatic Confessional project, miniature instrumentals, stream of consciousness, you could make no sound if you wish, fortune cookie fortunes, field recordings as they happen through your cell phone, street musicians, drug addicts, fistfights, sporting events, insane lunatic ravings, drunken ramblings, conversations, college class lectures, arguments, aphorisms, love-making sounds, sounds of urination and defecation, belching, farting, coughing, sneezing, hiccuping, stomach-rumbling, sounds of children and pets, machine sounds of all sorts, automobile sounds, public transportation sounds, subway, trains, buses, taxis, tunnels, interstate highways, industrial and factory sounds, advertisements, sounds from markets and shops and stores and restaurants and slaughterhouses, political protests, riots, demonstrations, townhall meetings, carnivals, circus, street preachers, drug and weapons deals going down, police raids, emergency and police sirens, telephones ringing, ringtones, alarms, clocks, doorbells, windmills, oil derricks, underpasses, abandoned ruined buildings, haunted houses, UFO sightings, other paranormal phenomena including EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), avatars, ghosts, seances, baptisms, table-tapping, church services, television and radio sounds, talk shows, video game sounds, rainstorms, thunder, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, sounds of war, sounds of death and dying and conception and birth, folk songs, anthems, toys, banjo and guitar picking and strumming, trumpet, flugelhorn, shruti box, harmonium, drums, beating on boxes and metal and found objects, your own little raps and jam sessions, jug-blowing music, kazoos, whistles, harmonicas, flutes, tell me what you think of me, sarcastic remarks, business meetings, conferences, prisons and jails, Hare Krishna chanting, seagulls, tugboats, paddlewheel boats, cruise ships, motorboats, sounds of fishing, clamming, and oystering, hunting sounds, guns, rifle ranges, helicopters, elevators, 78 RPM records, wire recordings, discarded tapes and CDs found on the street, dumpster-diving sounds, sounds of landfills and dumps, sounds from ancient Troy, sounds of surgery, amputations, guillotinings, beheadings, drawing and quartering, torture sounds, sounds of deviant practices, rubber bands, sex toys, the most boring sound ever, the most exciting sound ever, the most annoying sound ever, recite your grocery list, sounds of model trains, sounds of hammers, saws, crowbars, and other tools, crows, owls, birdsongs, cats, dogs, elephants, lions, coyotes, bears, wolves, cockfights, turkey gobbling, pigs grunting, mass suicides, archaeological digs, beer-drinking songs, sea shanties, kung fu fighting, karate chops, samurai swords clanging, graveyard sounds, skulls and bones rattling, interviews with vampires, Goths, Metal Kids, politicians, nursing home residents, street vendors, prophets, mystics, gurus, shamans, etc. \n\n\n\nThis project is in no way connected or affiliated with the Catholic Church or any other religious or political institution, such as the Masons or the U.S. government. \n\n\n\nThe Automatic Confessional project started at 12:00 PM on Wednesday, August 19, 2009. \n\n\n\nHal McGee",

      "about": "The Automatic Confessional was a project created and curated by Hal McGee from August 19, 2009 through March 2, 2010. Anyone and everyone was invited to leave a one minute message of any sounds they wanted on Hal McGee's microcassette answering machine.\n\n\n\nMcGee collected 21 one-hour tapes of messages. Message content ranges from ultra-mundane to random thoughts and musings to the scandalous, suicidal and erotic and murderous confessions. The content of the tapes was solely determined by the contributors, and their messages are presented here without editing, in the order that they were received. \n\n\n\nParticipants were invited to: \n\nCall the Automatic Confessional answering machine at 352-336-7915 and leave a one minute message of any words, thoughts, sounds, and noises. Anybody and everybody can participate! \n\n\n\n(Please note that the telephone number is no longer in service) \n\n\n\nHere is the original project description and project guidelines: \n\n\n\nYou are invited to telephone my microcassette answering machine and leave a message of one minute in length. Your message can be as short as you like - only a few seconds in length if you wish. \n\n\n\nAbsolutely anybody and everybody can participate. \n\n\n\nYour telephone will connect with the machine after a few seconds (you will probably hear two rings before it connects). Then you will hear a short spoken pre-recorded message from me, and will be instructed to leave your message after a long beep sound. \n\n\n\nThe telephone number is 352 336 7915 \n\n\n\nAt one minute you will hear a beep sound which indicates that the machine has stopped recording. \n\n\n\nThis is not my personal telephone number, and it is being used solely for the Automatic Confessional project. \n\n\n\nYou are allowed to leave a message of any sort, of any sounds, or words, or thoughts that you choose, with absolutely no restrictions on content. \n\n\n\nState your name in the message if you want people to know who it is and want to be credited for the message. \n\n\n\nYou may leave a message anonymously. \n\n\n\nYou can leave as many messages as you want and there are no restrictions on how often you leave a message, but try to show restraint and do not overdo it. The idea is to get as many different people involved as possible. \n\n\n\nI will not edit or restrict or censor the messages in any way. I want you to understand the full implications of what this means. I will allow any form of expression, no matter how offensive, objectionable, or tasteless -- this includes hate speech, racism, sexism, ageism, etc. This does not mean that I personally condone or approve of or agree with any content of any of the messages. \n\n\n\nThe answering machine tapes will be published online and will be available to the public. You are entirely responsible for the content of your messages. Think twice before you leave a message which may be personally embarrassing or compromising to you or someone else or which is slanderous, libelous, inflammatory, or hateful. Once I publish the tapes on the Internet the sounds you make in your message will be able to be heard by anyone forever. I will not remove your message from the tape - do not ask me to do so. You have been warned. Any regrets will be yours -- not mine. \n\n\n\nI can see this as an ongoing project that will evolve and change over time. Automatic Confessional will operate with the same lo-fi conceptual and fluxus spirit as my Dictaphonia Microcassette Compilation Project but will be more open-ended and free form. \n\n\n\nI am looking for a lot of variety in the messages, style-, content-, and mood-wise, a big grab bag audio trash heap collage. \n\n\n\nHere are some keywords, suggestions, possibilities and random thoughts about what you could contribute: \n\n\n\nrants, weird little sound effects, cryptic voice messages, funny, sexy, surreal, paranoid, confessions, word cut-ups, short sermons, speeches and essays, recordings from your answering machine, hate messages, haiku, circuit bent sounds, conspiracy talk, tell the machine your hopes and fears, pranks, jokes, static, buzzing, feedback of various sorts, dream recollections, confess your sins, lo tech electronic sounds, political statements, little poems and stories, just any random thoughts that come to your mind, commentary about the Automatic Confessional project, miniature instrumentals, stream of consciousness, you could make no sound if you wish, fortune cookie fortunes, field recordings as they happen through your cell phone, street musicians, drug addicts, fistfights, sporting events, insane lunatic ravings, drunken ramblings, conversations, college class lectures, arguments, aphorisms, love-making sounds, sounds of urination and defecation, belching, farting, coughing, sneezing, hiccuping, stomach-rumbling, sounds of children and pets, machine sounds of all sorts, automobile sounds, public transportation sounds, subway, trains, buses, taxis, tunnels, interstate highways, industrial and factory sounds, advertisements, sounds from markets and shops and stores and restaurants and slaughterhouses, political protests, riots, demonstrations, townhall meetings, carnivals, circus, street preachers, drug and weapons deals going down, police raids, emergency and police sirens, telephones ringing, ringtones, alarms, clocks, doorbells, windmills, oil derricks, underpasses, abandoned ruined buildings, haunted houses, UFO sightings, other paranormal phenomena including EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), avatars, ghosts, seances, baptisms, table-tapping, church services, television and radio sounds, talk shows, video game sounds, rainstorms, thunder, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, sounds of war, sounds of death and dying and conception and birth, folk songs, anthems, toys, banjo and guitar picking and strumming, trumpet, flugelhorn, shruti box, harmonium, drums, beating on boxes and metal and found objects, your own little raps and jam sessions, jug-blowing music, kazoos, whistles, harmonicas, flutes, tell me what you think of me, sarcastic remarks, business meetings, conferences, prisons and jails, Hare Krishna chanting, seagulls, tugboats, paddlewheel boats, cruise ships, motorboats, sounds of fishing, clamming, and oystering, hunting sounds, guns, rifle ranges, helicopters, elevators, 78 RPM records, wire recordings, discarded tapes and CDs found on the street, dumpster-diving sounds, sounds of landfills and dumps, sounds from ancient Troy, sounds of surgery, amputations, guillotinings, beheadings, drawing and quartering, torture sounds, sounds of deviant practices, rubber bands, sex toys, the most boring sound ever, the most exciting sound ever, the most annoying sound ever, recite your grocery list, sounds of model trains, sounds of hammers, saws, crowbars, and other tools, crows, owls, birdsongs, cats, dogs, elephants, lions, coyotes, bears, wolves, cockfights, turkey gobbling, pigs grunting, mass suicides, archaeological digs, beer-drinking songs, sea shanties, kung fu fighting, karate chops, samurai swords clanging, graveyard sounds, skulls and bones rattling, interviews with vampires, Goths, Metal Kids, politicians, nursing home residents, street vendors, prophets, mystics, gurus, shamans, etc. \n\n\n\nThis project is in no way connected or affiliated with the Catholic Church or any other religious or political institution, such as the Masons or the U.S. government. \n\n\n\nThe Automatic Confessional project started at 12:00 PM on Wednesday, August 19, 2009. \n\n\n\nHal McGee",

Automatic Confessional will operate with the same lo-fi conceptual and fluxus spirit as my Dictaphonia Microcassette Compilation Project but will be more open-ended and free form.\n\n\n\n I am looking for a lot of variety in the messages, style-, content-, and mood-wise, a big grab bag audio trash heap collage.\n\n\n\n Here are some keywords, suggestions, possibilities and random thoughts about what you could contribute:\n\n\n\n rants, weird little sound effects, cryptic voice messages, funny, sexy, surreal, paranoid, confessions, word cut-ups, short sermons, speeches and essays, recordings from your answering machine, hate messages, haiku, circuit bent sounds, conspiracy talk, tell the machine your hopes and fears, pranks, jokes, static, buzzing, feedback of various sorts, dream recollections, confess your sins, lo tech electronic sounds, political statements, little poems and stories, just any random thoughts that come to your mind, commentary about the Automatic Confessional project, miniature instrumentals, stream of consciousness, you could make no sound if you wish, fortune cookie fortunes, field recordings as they happen through your cell phone, street musicians, drug addicts, fistfights, sporting events, insane lunatic ravings, drunken ramblings, conversations, college class lectures, arguments, aphorisms, love-making sounds, sounds of urination and defecation, belching, farting, coughing, sneezing, hiccuping, stomach-rumbling, sounds of children and pets, machine sounds of all sorts, automobile sounds, public transportation sounds, subway, trains, buses, taxis, tunnels, interstate highways, industrial and factory sounds, advertisements, sounds from markets and shops and stores and restaurants and slaughterhouses, political protests, riots, demonstrations, townhall meetings, carnivals, circus, street preachers, drug and weapons deals going down, police raids, emergency and police sirens, telephones ringing, ringtones, alarms, clocks, doorbells, windmills, oil derricks, underpasses, abandoned ruined buildings, haunted houses, UFO sightings, other paranormal phenomena including EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomena), avatars, ghosts, seances, baptisms, table-tapping, church services, television and radio sounds, talk shows, video game sounds, rainstorms, thunder, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, sounds of war, sounds of death and dying and conception and birth, folk songs, anthems, toys, banjo and guitar picking and strumming, trumpet, flugelhorn, shruti box, harmonium, drums, beating on boxes and metal and found objects, your own little raps and jam sessions, jug-blowing music, kazoos, whistles, harmonicas, flutes, tell me what you think of me, sarcastic remarks, business meetings, conferences, prisons and jails, Hare Krishna chanting, seagulls, tugboats, paddlewheel boats, cruise ships, motorboats, sounds of fishing, clamming, and oystering, hunting sounds, guns, rifle ranges, helicopters, elevators, 78 RPM records, wire recordings, discarded tapes and CDs found on the street, dumpster-diving sounds, sounds of landfills and dumps, sounds from ancient Troy, sounds of surgery, amputations, guillotinings, beheadings, drawing and quartering, torture sounds, sounds of deviant practices, rubber bands, sex toys, the most boring sound ever, the most exciting sound ever, the most annoying sound ever, recite your grocery list, sounds of model trains, sounds of hammers, saws, crowbars, and other tools, crows, owls, birdsongs, cats, dogs, elephants, lions, coyotes, bears, wolves, cockfights, turkey gobbling, pigs grunting, mass suicides, archaeological digs, beer-drinking songs, sea shanties, kung fu fighting, karate chops, samurai swords clanging, graveyard sounds, skulls and bones rattling, interviews with vampires, Goths, Metal Kids, politicians, nursing home residents, street vendors, prophets, mystics, gurus, shamans, etc.\n\n\n\n This project is in no way connected or affiliated with the Catholic Church or any other religious or political institution, such as the Masons or the U.S. government.\n\n\n\n The Automatic Confessional project started at 12:00 PM on Wednesday, August 19, 2009.\n\n\n\n Hal McGee",

      "about": "A collection of 11 recordings by Hal McGee, solo and in collaboration (with Dave Fuglewicz and Paramutual Operator), collected here together for the first time as an album, recorded and originally released online at halmcgee. com in the last seven months of 2007. Live and home studio recordings: noise, electronic, 4-track cassette works, microcassette tape collage.\n\n\n\nDownload the album to view 16 photos and pics in the zip file.\n\n\n\n01 Dave Fuglewicz and Hal McGee with Paramutual Operator Live at Tampa Noise Fest, June 9, 2007\n\nDave Fuglewicz - ARP 2600, Hal McGee - Moog Voyager, Jen Abell (Paramutual Operator) - Moog Rogue synthesizer. Free form analog synthesizer space exploration music featuring two members of The Analog Synthesizer Ensemble (Jen Abell and Hal McGee) and Dave Fuglewicz. Original recording by Andrew Chadwick (Ironing).\n\n\n\n02 Hal McGee: benttapecircuitfuck\n\nRecorded Tuesday, August 7, 2007. Circuit bent Casio SK-1, Fostex X-12 4-track cassette recorder, Behringer Eurorack UB802.\n\n\n\n03 Hal McGee: Aleatorium\n\nCreated with circuit bent Casio SK-1 and SK-5 (both bent by Waterhed), a glorious $100 Fostex X-12 4-track cassette recorder, and an equally glorious $50 Behringer Eurorack UB802 mixer. The angrier, more agitated, more irritated and more depressed I get ... the more productive I get!\n\n\n\n04 Hal McGee: Live at Action Research 7\n\nRecorded live, Wednesday, October 24, 2007, at Action Research show #7, 2nd Street Bakery, Gainesville, Florida. Hal McGee presented a no-input-mixer feedback performance, utilizing Behringer UB802 mixer, Moog MF-102 Ring Modulator, Moog MF-104Z Analog Delay, Alesis Microverb III, Marshall MG10 amplifier. Recorded on a Sony TCM-200DV cassette recorder.\n\n\n\n05 Hal McGee: Sandwichism\n\nA microcassette cut-up collage by Hal McGee, featuring the voice of Jen Sandwich, and sounds recorded in and near her home in Palmetto, Florida - and Brad Kokay too.\n\n\n\n06 Hal McGee: Live at Unbalanced Connection 42\n\nExcerptage of live performance recording at the University of Florida School of Music, Room 102, on Friday, November 9, 2007. Hal McGee on Moog Etherwave Theremin, circuit bent Casio Rapman, cassette field recordings from the hours preceding the show, circuit bent Casio SK-1, shortwave radio, Moog MF-102 Ring Modulator, and Moog MF-104 Analog Delay. The performance was actually about 10-11 minutes long. At one point during the performance I must have bumped the Open/Close button on the front of the Harman/Kardon TD 420 cassette deck that I was using to record the show... As soon as I noticed I resumed recording. I can barely notice where it stops and starts again. Any way, I think that it is a killer recording of a performance that at the time I did not like too much, because I couldn't hear it well (stage monitor was not positioned properly and not turned up loud enough).\n\n\n\n07-10 Hal McGee: Positive Anger 01-04\n\nHere are recordings of minimal synthesizer noise music, with a touch of that old school 1980s harsh industrial power electronics flavor -->> created with the Little Boy Blue synth, Moog MF-102 Ring Modulator, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi Distortion (Russian-made), Moog MF-104 Analog Delay, Alesis Microverb III digital reverb, all patched back into Behringer Eurorack UB802 mixer in a feedback loop. All four improvised tracks were recorded live in Hal's home studio, direct to cassette, Friday, November 23, 2007.\n\n\n\n08 Hal McGee: Live at Action Research 8\n\nHal McGee recorded live at Action Research show #8, Friday, November 17, 2007, at Tim & Terry's, Gainesville, Florida. I played Custom Black Edition Little Boy Blue analog synthesizer [by Flower Electronics], Moog MF-102 Ring Modulator, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi Distortion (Russian-made), Moog MF-104 Analog Delay, Alesis Microverb III digital reverb, all patched back into Behringer Eurorack UB802 mixer in a feedback loop. This performance was a sort of high water mark for me as an artist, and I count it as a highlight in my life. I had been working toward this kind of sound, and I finally found it! After I performed K. Paul commented that it sounded like \"Italian Futurist Macho Electronics\". When he said this I just about literally laughed my ass off because just the day before I had re-read The Art Of Noises Manifesto (1913) by Luigi Russolo. Then K. Paul started quoting some lines from Futurist leader F.T. Marinetti's poem \"the Battle Of Adrianople\" (which is included in Russolo's piece). Check out the ultra sonic high-pitched harmonic modulation and the bone-shaking low bass tones. The bass was especially awesome, and K. Paul said of the music I played that it possessed big low-hanging balls made of pig iron. LOL. Recorded by K. Paul. This recording includes plenty of audience sounds and comments after the performance.",

Salad). A.M. Salad will be playing at three of the four dates on our tour. Also playing tonight with us will be The Clang Quartet, featuring Scotty Irving, who many of you heard on Charles Rice Goff III's Taped Rugs 06 Tour Of The Southeast USA 7xCDr + DVDr set. \n\n\n\nOn Friday we will travel to Richmond, Virginia, where we will play at Pom Palace, 500 W. Marshall. This show is organized by our friend Kelly Nourse (Constant Mauk, who will also be playing at the Sonic Circuits Festival). \n\n\n\nSaturday it will be time for what will probably be the highlight of our trip, the Sonic Circuits Festival in Washington DC! This month-long event is organized and operated by Jeff Surak, one of my hometaper associates from the 1980s. I will be meeting up with Zan Hoffman (who will also be performing that night) for the first time in about 20 years.\n\n\n\nSonic Circuits\n\nSaturday, September 15, 2007, at The Warehouse\n\n1017 7th St NW, Washington, DC 20001\n\nMetro: Mount Vernon Sq/Convention Center\n\nShow time: 8:00pm\n\nTickets: $12.00\n\nBaseline\n\nEsther Venrooy\n\nOier Etxeberria \n\nHal McGee\n\nGunung Sari\n\nZan Hoffman\n\nIroning\n\nConstant Mauk\n\na.m. salad\n\nMusica Ex Machina festival presentation\n\n\n\nWe will take Sunday off to hang out and spend time with friends, and we might go see the Sunday night Sonic Circuits show -- I am especially looking forward to seeing Michael Thomas Jackson for the first time in 17 years.\n\n\n\nAnd on Monday the 17th we will travel to Charleston, South Carolina, where we will perform with Kieran Daly and Sam Sfirri at Rivers Communications Museum, at 58 George Street.\n\n\n\nI will be taking with me copies of my The Man With The Tape Recorder CDR for sale and trade, as well as my newest release, a 90-minute cassette called NoiseFuck Monument. We will also have Hissing Across America t-shirts for sale.\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to make sounds during my upcoming performances in Chapel Hill, Richmond, Washington DC and Charleston. In fact, I encourage it. If you want to bring a small handheld sound-maker of some sort, please do so. Examples: portable shortwave or other radio, circuit bent gear, Casios, Gameboys, homemade instruments, flutes and other wind instruments such as horns and party hooters, small drums and other percussives such as pots and pans, music toys, spoken texts, appliances, etc. Items should be acoustic or have a built-in speaker, all battery-operated (nothing requiring plug-in electricity) - NO amplification! -- and do not play these during sets by the other performers. I will record bits and pieces here and there of interesting audience sounds and include them in a live-action cut-up tape collage that I will create on-the-spot \"on-stage\".\n\n\n\nHere is some info on Ironing and A.M. Salad:\n\n\n\nIroning is focused on manipulating and recontextualizing somewhat autobiographical sound sources, altering them through lo-fi analog processes. A pile of cast off equipment, hissy tapes and damaged records get worked into a collage of microcassette field recordings, blown out Miami beats, local radio and abused cassettes in a noise collage meets hyperactive dub frenzy. \n\n\n\nA.M. Salad is an ever-changing sound sculpture set in motion, currently existing at a junction between energized, chaotic rumble and waves of trancing drone; a moody, schizo-sensory treatment fusing meditation and destruction. Sounds are teased from mic'd wire, metal, tools, assemblages, and junk instruments by way of flailing, untamed movement from man, device, and environment. Sounds are altered and infused with various electronics. \n\nHal\n\n\n\nP.S. Plus, I will be doing a show in Tallahassee on September 24th with Pax Titania, Jijimuge, and others.\n\n\n\n-------------------------\n\n\n\nHere is an article written by Grayson Currin, which originally appeared in the Wednesday, September 12, 2007 issue of Independent Weekly. I quoted copiously from this article during my live performances in Chapel Hill, Richmond, Washington, and Charleston.\n\n\n\nHal McGee will leave his home in Gainesville, Fla., for a four-show tour along the East Coast in less than 100 hours, and right now, the only thing he knows he'll have with him is a handheld silver Sony tape recorder. He'll probably take some clothes, maybe some keyboards with bent circuits, perhaps a transistor radio, and possibly a video camera to tape his sets. But, for six days, that tape recorder and one blank tape will be McGee's primary instruments. He has no idea what it will sound like.\n\n\n\n\"I've worked with live improvisation and tape collage before,\" says McGee, \"but this is the first time I'm doing them together.\"\n\n\n\nAs McGee pulls away from Florida en route to his set at the month-long Washington, D.C., experimental festival Sonic Circuits, he'll begin recording sounds that intrigue him—bits of conversation, a phrase read from a scrap of paper hidden in his travel bag, moments heard from the window of his car as he travels north along Interstate 95. When he arrives in Chapel Hill, he'll rewind the tape, listen for an interesting starting point and push play. As the tape advances, he'll encourage the audience to play along to the collage with the items and instruments he hopes they bring to the show. And when he hears something worth recording, he'll press record and begin the process again. As the tour progresses, the sounds pulled from one night's show will erase bits of other nights, nesting the present inside of a partially erased past, stored for possible future use. This sort of imposed surrealism fascinates McGee: \"It's a combination of choice and chance.... I am looking for unexpected, weird juxtapositions of sounds I record. Oftentimes, I surprise myself even as I discover these things.\"\n\n\n\nThe indeterminate questions McGee's set-up offers reveal several interesting, practical challenges: Each stop depends on an interaction with an audience that may not exist. He could be recording total stillness. He's never played any of the rooms on his itinerary, either, so he's not sure whether he will run his tape deck through a club's sound system or just rely on the recorder's tiny internal speaker. This is his chance for solo interactive listening.\n\n\n\n\"A lot of artists don't leave any room to listen to sound. If the entire sound field has this assault mentality, you can't listen,\" he says. \"And I'm challenging myself and the audience to listen and hear these relationships of sounds.\"\n\n\n\nHal McGee joins Ironing, Clang Quartet and AM Salad at Nightlight Thursday, Sept. 13, at 9:30 p.m. Tickets are $6.\n\n\n\n------------------\n\n\n\nHal McGee at Nightlight Club, Chapel, Hill, North Carolina, Thursday, September 13, 2007. See photograph by Katherin Machalek (photo available with download). Here you see me with my Sony TCM-200DV cassette recorder, my circuit bent Casio SK-1, and a text that I took from the Interweb. During the performance I read passages from books that I brought with me, and books that I found on the tables at Nightlight, such as Simone De Beauvoir's The Second Sex. Two times during the performance I walked up to a bookshelf, pulled a random book off the shelf, opened to a random page, plopped my finger down, and read a phrase.\n\n\n\nIn addition to shooting video of my performance, Andrew Chadwick recorded sections of my performance in progress on a portable cassette recorder, and then played back various fragments during the performance, which I then recorded on to the Sony recorder, making the re-recorded fragments part of the collage and the preformance. Keith Childress recorded my entire Chapel Hill performance on microcassette. He played back these recordings during my performances in Richmond and Washington.\n\n\n\nSee photograph by - of Hal McGee records Bryce Eiman playing his Casio SK-5 keyboard (see photos available in album download). In the Interweb bulletins I sent out prior to the tour, I invited audience members to bring their own portable sound-makers (see above). Before the show Bryce told me that he bought one of my Dog As Master cassette releases about 20 years ago. That night we stayed at Jason Leonard's house, who has one of the biggest and nicest dogs I have ever met. I recorded the guitar, squeaky door, and some household sounds, as well as some found texts, at Jason's on Friday morning. Before Andrew and I drove to Richmond, we ate lunch at Carrburritos, where I ate a yummy Pure' de Papas (sweet potato) burrito [possibly the best burrito I have ever eaten].\n\n\n\n--------------------\n\n\n\nThe show on September 14th was at Pom Hole, 500 W. Marshall Street, Richmond, Virginia. It was a rainy night, and we played to an enthusiastic, rowdy audience of about 30-40 in a tiny basement of a house. M.C. Nazi Dad got the audience whipped up to a frenzy with her pseudo-neo-fascist rantings.\n\n\n\nSee photograph by -. Hal playing back a section of the tape, before stopping and cutting in new material. See Andrew's hand holding his cassette recorder, on which he is recording me playing back the material. Thanks to Kelly Nourse for setting up the show. We stayed at her apartment, where I recorded some of the household sounds that you hear on the tape. I was also happy to get to meet Kenny Yates, one of the key figures, along with Nourse, of the 804 Noise Collective. We had coffee on Friday and breakfast on Saturday at Crossroads Coffee & Ice Cream.\n\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n\nHere I will share with you an excerpt from the MySpace Blog of A.M. Salad (Keith Childress):\n\n\n\n...Then it was off to Chapel Hill to meet up with Hal McGee and Ironing who I played with during the final three shows of the tour. Clang Quartet joined us in Chapel Hill for a performance of noise energy with wearable sound makers that also acted as statements on the religious beliefs of the performer. He is also a very talented percussionist and utilizes a bombardment of cymbals and other beatables. He didn't make a believer outta me in the greater sense, but I respect his passion and I have to say the Clang Quartet performance is quite an experience that I would recommend checking out. And he is a really nice guy too. Richmond had a surprising turnout even with it raining buckets of buckets outside. Narwhalz (Of Sound) got to the final level of Zeltar as a gameboy was turned into a key unlocking the pixel world long enough for it to shatter into a million sounds while Bald Bull punches you the fuck out and wedges your limp body between two Tetris blocks. The Sonic Circuits Festival in D.C. was very well done, with some pretty varied and interesting sets... among them were Zan Hoffman and Constant Mauk, both of which are also really nice people to talk with... Zan gave lots of suggestions on cool places to play overseas. Constant Mauk played a nice short set of huzz crackle and swishes with some electronic treatments and contact mic speaker massages, weaving a cloud over our heads only to have it burst into feathers that weighed as much as anvils. Zan hammed it up as he peeked over his executive-style briefcase while electronically fucking with recordings he made of the previous Sonic Circuits performers earlier in the evening as well as other tweaked audio, all while dashing around in a slick suit handing out documents to the crowd. I wish I could tap into Zan's energy level. I had a blast hanging w/ Andrew Chadwick (Ironing) and Hal McGee throughout the final three days of the tour. All three of their sets that I witnessed were really damn good. Andrew has a knack for the cassette / turntable audio overload assault. The murky loops and slowed downers infuse with in-between beats and clutter, and then it seems to come together just long enough to confuse, and then Janet Jackson slips in a comment on how nasty the boys are and its soooo true. Ladies? Awesome. Hal really threw me for a loop, literally, with an amazing lecture of readings from random pages in books and loose papers while recording his readings and then plopping some circuit bent splushes on top, rewinding and adding some pot and pan percussion... press play and add something random off the tape which might have been from 2 minutes earlier or maybe it was from some comment or found sound he squeezed on there while walking through a gas station parking lot the night before. Loops, electronic slosh, comments on stereophonic sound, record, play, readings from the article written in the local independent press about the very show he is performing that moment, etc., etc. Oh, and all the sounds were unamplified... all coming from either his mouth, or the tiny speakers on his handheld tape recorders or battery operated casios and circuit toys. Andrew assisted with the \"press record, press play, rewind, play, record\" musical button game, which added to the amazement. I joined in on two of Hal's sets adding microcassette accompaniment of raw audio I recorded from his Chapel Hill performance... my favorite moments were when Hal was reading a passage in real time while one of his taped readings haunted the background space at the same time...\n\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n\nSee downloadable photo by Hal of Andrew Chadwick, Keith Childress and - on Sunday morning, September 16, 2007, in Baltimore. Baltimore was perhaps my favorite of the cities that I visited during the tour. Here you see us walking up the hill to West 36th in the Hampden area, where we ate breakfast at The Golden West Cafe (where I ordered Huevos Montuleños), visited Atomic Books, and a cool local record store, The True Vine Record Shop, that bought some tapes and CDRs from me and Andrew. It was during this time in Hampden that I recorded me reciting words from flyers I taped to shop windows and walls (such as the bits about \"cowboys and clanking robots\", \"no loitering within 8000 miles of this sign\", and suggestions for playing a secret, quiet concert in a public library). I really had a lot of fun staying at Keith and -'s house on Fait Avenue on Saturday and Sunday nights. - made some excellent percolated coffee using the classic Chock full o'Nuts brand coffee. I definitely want to go back to Baltimore and visit Keith and - again - and I have some ideas about shooting a new video there similar to The Secret Life Of Hal McGee.\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\nSee downloadable photo of Michael Thomas Jackson (with Noel Hunter). On Sunday night, September 16th, Andrew and I attended the Sonic Circuits concert at the Black Cat Lounge. It was a great event for me because I got to meet up with Michael Thomas Jackson (who performed that night with Brian Osbourne), an old friend of mine, who lived in Memphis, from the 1980s hometaper days! The last time I had seen him was 1990! Michael used to record under the name Cephalic Index in the 1980s, and as a duo with Chris Phinney under the name Cancerous Growth. Phinney, Jackson, and I recorded a tape of free improv analog synthesizer music called Ditch. Jackson also operated the XKurzhen Sound label, and he released my tape Weed, by Dog As Master. He now lives in North Carolina and is still quite active with experimental music activities.\n\n\n\n----------------\n\n\n\nOn Monday, September 17, 2007 Andrew and I drove from Baltimore, Maryland to Charleston, South Carolina, for a show at the John Rivers Communications Museum. The show was organized by Non. Other performers that evening were Sam Sfirri, and Kieran Daly. Before the show and walked through the museum, looking at the displays and reading out loud from some of the information placards and recording. At the beginning of my performance I instructed the audience members to get on their feet, and with my microcassette and cassette recorders in hand I led them through the museum, stopping in front of some of the exhibits and placards. I even took them into the Men's Bathroom where I flushed the toilet and recorded the sound, as well as out the front door of the museum and onto the sidewalk on George Street. After the show, the curator of the museum, Rick Zender, took us on a personal guided tour through the museum. You can hear his voice on both sides of Zen and the Art of the Tape Recorder. I was happy to get to meet Ashley Coon, who attended the show, and with whom Andrew and I had breakfast on Tuesday at Rutledge Coffee & Cream. It was also nice to get to spend some time with Andrew Barranca (Gaybomb), who let us sleep at his house that night.\n\n\n\n-------------------\n\n\n\nMany of the sound recordings that you hear on Side Two of the tape come from road trip to and from Tallahassee, Florida, where I performed on Monday night, September 24, 2007. I was accompanied on that trip by Bobby Moseley, Jesi Langdale, Jay Peele, and Seth SOS, all of whom performed as Jijimuge that night. You can also hear fragments of sounds that I recorded at the Blast and Aposable Scum show at 1982 in Gainesville on the night before.\n\n\n\n---------------------\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Christopher Cprek (Pax Titania), who set up the show at The Beta Bar. I enjoyed staying at Chris and Irene Moon's house in Tallahassee, and meeting their cat and dog, and watching weird videos about volcanoes and the brain. Irene fixed some delicious Yuban coffee on Tuesday morning, and Chris made pancakes and biscuits for us.\n\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\n\nsee downloadable photo of Hal McGee doing microcassette feedback performance at Microshow, September 30, 2007, at Jesi Langdale's house in Gainesville, Florida. You can hear sections of this near the end of Zen and the Art of the Tape Recorder.",

Listening to The Analog Synthesizer Ensemble is like taking trips through outer and inner space. Black hole tripping. Abstract, cosmic, crunchy, crusty, spacey, noisy free improvisational experimental electronic music created with analog synthesizers.\n\n\n\n01 Black Hole Departure\n\nThe first improvisational jam from the Saturday, March 3rd analog synthesizer jam session recording at Hal McGee's apartment in Gainesville, Florida. On this track Brandon Abell (Microwave Windows) and Jay Peele (of Cellular Terror) played Moog MG-1 synthesizers, Jenifer Abell (Paramutual Operator) on Moog Rogue synth, Hal McGee on Moog Voyager RME synth.\n\n\n\n02 Optical Solar Search\n\nThe second improvisation. Moog MG-1 synthesizers, Moog Rogue, and Moog Voyager RME synth.\n\n\n\n03 Accelerate\n\nThe fourth improvisation. Moog MG-1 synthesizers, Moog Rogue, and Moog Voyager RME synth. \n\n\n\n04 Life From Afar\n\nThe fifth improvisation. Moog MG-1 synthesizers, Moog Rogue, Moog Voyager RME synth, and Octave Cat synth.\n\n\n\n05 Distant Forms.\n\nThe sixth jam. Moog MG-1 synthesizers, Moog Rogue, Moog Voyager RME synth, and Octave Cat synth.\n\n\n\n06 Space Docking",

      "about": "In the Spring of 2004 I invited 25 experimental music artists to send raw audio material to me. I mixed together their material with my own into two big multi-layered abstract audio sound sculpture collages, and released them on a home-produced CDR.\n\n\n\nCollage Mania #1 participants:\n\nXV Parowek, Poland (field recordings, electronics, manipulations); Adam Bohman, England (voice, tapes); busyditch, USA (tapes, theremin, circuit bent Speak & Spell and Casio SK-1, Portable Anarchy circuit bent sound generator, synths, prepared turntable); Don Campau, USA (voice, synth, guitar, tapes); Mike Cosma, USA (voice, guitar, rhythms); davmo, USA (tape effects, percussion, electric guitar); dustindustrial, USA (circuit bent Speak & Math and E-Z Groove Bongoes, Alesis Air Synth, Korg Kaoss, synths); Fever Spoor, The Netherlands (field recordings, voice, metal, glass, singing bowl, thumb piano); Finalcut, Belgium (tapes, electronics, effects, manipulations); Dave Fuglewicz, USA (software synthesizers, samples); Charles Rice Goff III, USA (voice, MicroMoog synth); Pascal Hament, The Netherlands (Korg Kaoss, cracklebox, synth, tapes, piano); Brice Hornback, USA (self-built modular analog synth); Invader From Mars, Japan (trash noise sounds); G.X. Jupitter-Larsen, USA (tape from a Haters performance); Mac of BIOnighT, Italy (voice, tapes, saw, artificial and altered sounds); Al Margolis [If, Bwana], USA (guitar synthesizer); Chris Phinney [Mental Anguish], USA (electric guitar, ebow, Reason 2.0); Napalmed, Czech Republic (manipulations of industrial shop sounds); Keith Nicolay [Post Prandials], USA (guitar, flute); Brian Noring, USA (guitar, Moog Sonic Six synthesizer); Planetaldol, France (field recordings, manipulations); Mark Sonnenfeld, USA (poetics, field recordings); Straiph, Scotland (tapes); Philipp Wolokitin [Monopolka], Russia (circuit bent electronics and toy instruments); Zyrtax, The Netherlands (voice manipulations); and me, Hal McGee, USA (voice, piano, shortwave radio, Moog theremin, tapes, cracklebox, circuit bent Casio SK-1 and SK-5).\n\n\n\nI promise you that you've never heard anything like Collage Mania before. It's big, noisy and seemingly chaotic. But repeated listenings will reveal new details. Every time you listen to it you will hear something new. Don't expect melodies, beats and rhythms. These are present in Collage Mania, but they are used as abstract elements in the collage. Collage Mania is entertaining, but it requires the listener to actively listen. Collage Mania is funny, aggravating, \"difficult\", hysterical, and off the wall. It's a highly-detailed, richly-textured work that will continue to amaze you every time you listen to it. Mixed and mastered by Hal McGee on July 4, 2004. Constructed on a Fostex X-12 4-track cassette recorder.",

I loaded their source sounds onto a 4-track cassette tape recorder, added my sounds, and mixed the tracks. There is some overlap from one track to the next, and on the original CDR version you could listen to the album in a free-flowing manner from track to track with the feeling of a continuous collage. Lots of analog and digital synthesizers, theremin, circuit bent and computer sounds. This is a mail collaboration compilation, originally released on CDR on the HalTapes label, 2005",

      "about": "Professor McGee's Laboratory by Hal McGee was originally released on CDR on the HalTapes label in October 2003.\n\n\n\nJeff Surak wrote:\n\n\n\nI enjoyed listening to Professor McGee's Laboratory CDR the last two days. It's quite an overload. A condensed version of a month in the life of Hal, in 77 minutes. It is truly a textbook example of modern American folk music. Noise naive school of primitivism.\n\n\n\nreview by Jerry Kranitz from Aural Innovations:\n\n\n\nProfessor McGee's Laboratory is a sound art and collage of every-sound-under-the-sun work that will appeal to fans of Hal's My Brain, Wired For Sound, and similar recordings. The CD consists of 5 tracks of almost identical 15+ minutes length, in which Hal does his patented tape recorder as compositional tool thing.\n\n\n\n\"Crumbite Saliwanchik Topassout\" is an electro-acoustic sound collage piece with a Macy's Day Parade full of percussion, strings, accordion, and the usual Hal melee of field recordings that include the sounds of the city and countless other sounds and assorted voices, including his own musings. My favorite parts are where we've got an all-you-can-eat banquet of sounds, music and talking, while the accordion serenades us as if we were having a candlelight dinner in an Italian restaurant that doubles as a performance space. Fun huh? It is! Another highlight segment is where a dissonant Oriental styled guitar pattern fills the lulling accordion role while Hal chats and dense noise waves create a harsh sonic backdrop. We get a similar effect from the piano during a section on \"Documentation & Illustration Of My Present Tendencies\", which brings a bit of peaceful bliss to a track that includes some of the harshest and most chaotic moments of the set (dig that acid rock guitar). Of course the piano doesn't stay peaceful for long and we later hear bits of the maddened concert pianist sweating with passion as he attacks the keyboard.\n\n\n\nI have a fondness for Hal's works that emphasize the sounds of the urban landscape, and \"Swamp Operetta With Cricket, Pianoette and Theremin\" and \"Nothing Else Smells Quite Like It\" are characteristic of this area of Hal's sound art compositions. On Swamp Operetta we ride along with Hal as he chats with folks on the bus on the way to his destination. Very much a hangin-with-Hal piece, we journey along hearing every subtle sound that accompanies the ride... conversations, outside traffic, work crews, kids playing, etc... things we probably wouldn't even take note of if we were out and about in the city ourselves. And of course there's plenty of electronics, theremin and pianoette (courtesy of Brian Noring), more of that Oriental sounding guitar, and general sonic aggression coloring the proceedings, as if to create a musical interpretation of the real life activity it accompanies. \"Nothing Else Smells Quite Like It\" has a similar focus on city life, but also includes a steady stream of Hal's spoken word poetry.\n\n\n\nI got a kick out the part where Hal is bewildered over why his shoes keep coming untied and wonders if it might mean anything. See how wrapped up you can get in the details!! And it may be no coincidence that immediately after the part about his shoes we hear Hal talk about how he has endeavored to \"develop recording and compositional techniques designed to open up pathways of exploration for the listener\". The path Hal has opened offers a wide berth and lays out a warm, fuzzy welcome mat. The rest is up to the listener, the challenge perhaps being not so much the nature of the recording itself as the willingness of the listener to climb aboard and let his/her own perceptions and subjective experience of Hal's work be the guide.",

      "about": "On Hoax, Hal McGee teams up with veteran underground hometaper recording artist Don Campau for two lengthy excursions based on the theme of hoax viruses (ultimately harmless and intended only to cause unwarranted panic).\n\n\n\nReview by Jerry Kranitz in the August 2003 issue of Aural Innovations.\n\n\n\n\"Jdbgmgr.exe\" refers to a hoax virus that according to the Symantec site tries to encourage you to delete a legitimate Windows file from your computer. The track is a 31 minute journey that combines electronics, piano, guitar, percussion and probably much more. The piano varies between jazzy and dark intense classical stylings, and the overall work often has a full orchestral feel, though of course it's all happening in a general sound-art atmosphere. The electric guitar provides some tasty rockin acidic and noise bits, as well as a moody intensity, while the acoustic guitar provides more laid back stylings. I like the section around the 25 minute mark where Don is jamming high volume on the guitar while a tinkling piano melody drifts along. A wild combo with Hal's electronics. The electronics throughout provide color, dense backdrops, harsh noise waves and oodles of alien freakiness. I enjoyed the parts where a single electro line would ooh-wee-ooh meander in a near melodic fashion, which sounded pretty cool along with the piano. The aggression level can get pretty high but is relatively restrained and rarely overpowers the underlying \"musical\" feel.\n\n\n\n\"Forward As An Attachment\" begins with piano and percussion free-jazz stylings and some fairly up-front sound patterns. I like the sandpaper texture that provides an interesting contrast to the piano. Don's guitar once again gets mucho rockin and around the 10 minute mark there's a chaotic rock and jazz jam with ethno percussion and electronics that I particularly enjoyed. There are lots of segments throughout this 46 minute piece in which the piano and guitar (both electric and acoustic) jam along while various electronic tones and patterns pop in and out. And as I make my way through the album I think it's the combination of traditional instrumentation and musical styles combined with the sound-art explorations that make this such an interesting listen. It's certainly different from most of Hal's collaborations I've heard to date, though Don can get deep into the experimental sound realm himself.",

      "about": "This was my first collaborative recording with Dave Fuglewicz, who has been making some great psychedelic space music based around the ARP 2600 analog synthesizer since the mid 1980s.\n\n \n\nFuglewicz sent to me two CDs filled with ARP 2600 improvisations and oscillator fragments; and percussion loops and freaky samples processed with Sound Forge, Quasi-Fractal, Coagula, Hammer head and Total Recorder. I layered and sequenced his raw sonic materials using chance process methods, and added on my own sounds: Moog Etherwave theremin, circuit bent Casio SK-1, shortwave radio, Analogue Solutions Tri Tone 24 synth, Radio Shack MG-1 Moog synth, Dark Star synth module (built by Fuglewicz), Yamaha DGX-500, and a tape we had never used of a live in-person improv jam we did at Dave's house back in 2000.\n\n\n\nSynergistic Deconstruction is music for the mind. When two minds are joined together in a common effort -- in this case space travel -- a third mind arises, which becomes the vehicle for intergalactic and microcosmic exploration.\n\n\n\nIf you like Klaus Schulze, Tangerine Dream, Cluster, Synergy, Conrad Schnitzler and classic 1980s Industrial Music you might very well like this CD. By listening to this CD you can travel millions of miles and millions of years in 77 minutes without ever leaving your living room or bedroom. Strap yourself in and get ready to travel with these two extended electronic music tracks: \"Dislocated Chronicles\" and \"Synergistic Deconstruction\". Leave your linear thinking on your doorstep. Turn your mind sideways, slip through the fractures in time created by the music. Past, present, future melt into one continuum. You are here. You are there. You are nowhere. Before you leave you have returned. At one moment you are reliving the birth of life on Earth -- in the next moment you are sipping a syrupy beverage and smoking a hookah pipe in a jazz bar in Area 59 on the planet Roswell in the Alpha Omicron system -- out the window you see a seductive black hole sucking up light, stars, gas, and memories of a life you left behind, back there on earth in an easy chair, with water dripping on your forehead from the leaky roof. \n\n\n\nVisit Dave Fuglewicz's web site: \n\nwww.davefuglewicz.com\n\n\n\n Read a review of Synergistic Deconstruction in Aural Innovations: \n\naural-innovations.com/2004/january/haldave1.html \n\n\n\n HAL MCGEE: Moog Theremin, piano, circuit bent Casio SK-1, Radio Shack DX-397 short wave radio, Analogue Solutions Tri Tone 24 synthesizer, Realistic MG-1 synthesizer, Casio VA-10, Dark Star synthesizer module, Electro Harmonix Deluxe Memory Man, Casio SK-200, ARP Odyssey, Alesis Microverb III\n\n\n\nDAVE FUGLEWICZ: ARP 2600 synthesizer, Textronix oscillators, Digitech RDS 7.6, computer: Sound Forge, Quasi-Fractal, Coagula, Hammer Head, Total Recorder",

      "about": "Two big abstract dada sound collages consisting of live action electronics, cut-up tapes of street and environmental sound recordings made on a handheld cassette recorder, free improvisation noise jams, avant garde grand piano, electric guitar, two theremins, and a West African 19-string instrument -- the kora. The sound of American Primitive is as big, bold, noisy, rowdy, violent, playful, excessive, trashy and chaotic and contradictory as American life itself. Recorded in August 2003 in the savage wilderness of urban Florida. \n\n\n\nPoints of reference include: audio ethnography, noise music, dada, surrealism, Abstract Expressionism, art of the insane and Art Brut, Jean Dubuffet, the cut-up methods of William S. Burroughs, chance process and aleatory methods, John Cage, Stockhausen, AMM, cassette culture, lo fi lo tech, analog, krautrock. \n\n\n\nBig Briar (Moog) Etherwave Theremin, kora, moodiness, disgust, Sony Cassette-Corder TCM-453V, circuit-bent Casio SK-1, Yamaha DGX-500 portable grand piano, bongos, Radio Shack DX-397 shortwave radio, headaches, Epiphone Special II electric guitar, Marshall MG10 amplifier, Casio Rapman, Audio Technica condenser microphone, black clothing, anxiety, arbitrariness, receding hairline, indigestion, voice, Professor Television Photo-theremin, Alesis Microverb III, ear hair, Sony CDP-XE400 compact disc player, provocation, Fostex X-12 4-track cassette recorder, Philips CDR200 compact disc recorder, aggravation, tapes. \n\n\n\n78 minutes of free form audio madness in two long tracks: \"Radicals vs. Guardians\" and \"Equal-Opportunity Chaos\".\n\n\n\nreview by Jerry Kranitz in the January 2004 issue of Aural Innovations:\n\n\n\nAmerican Primitive is something of a McGee family collaboration. We've got Hal employing his usual arsenal of gear, accompanied by Mark McGee on bongos and voice, Evan McGee on Casio and voice and Kyle McGee on keyboards and voice (along with more voice by \"Waldo\").\n\n\n\nThe CD consists of 2 lengthy works. The 31 minute \"Radicals vs. Guardians\" is a roller coaster ride sound art piece with concert-pianist-gone-mad ivory tickling, brain shattering noise tones, the trademark Hal glom of voices and, of course, a potpourri of clattering and musical sounds. As a whole this is among Hal's harshest works. But I really like the piano style which injects a frantic pace and even a feeling of a groove to the proceedings... which is pretty wild running the course against all the mayhem going on around it. It's a startling contrast and my head was spinning by the end of this half hour of sonic destruction. There's lots of dense high volume stuff to be sure. But even at its most aggressive I was aware of all the separate elements that made up the whole, as opposed to it all just being a giant meganoise wall of sound. I do get stuff like that sent to me and it just isn't very interesting. I don't mind my senses being tortured. I like it sometimes. And indeed Hal gives us plenty to dwell on and consider as we clutch white knuckled to the tree trunk, watching the wreckage and debris blowing by and waiting for the hurricane to subside.\n\n\n\nAfter a breather and a restoring cup of tea I felt sufficiently bucked up to put on the headphones and dive back in to tackle track 2, the 47 minute \"Equal-Opportunity Chaos\". Having survived the wrath of \"Radicals vs. Guardians\" I was feeling much like Evil Knievel must have when he was nearing the milestone of having broken every bone in his body. Bring it on... ya can't hurt me... in fact, I welcome it. Chaos is very much what this piece is about, though Hal is clearly in control. And while this is very similar to \"Radicals vs. Guardians\" in terms of the chaotic collage like nature of the piece, it's far less aggressive and won't shatter nearly as many of your neurons (though it's by no means light listening). It's a full banquet of avant-garde free-improv music, freaky alien electronics and aural fingerpainting. Much of it is surprisingly \"musical\". Lots happening here... lots of treasures to mine.",

      "about": "original recordings by Brian Noring and Hal McGee\n\nDes Moines, Iowa October 2001\n\nmixed by Hal McGee February 2002\n\n\n\nDownload the album to view complete album artwork in the zip file\n\n\n\nreview of Random Sound Generator by Jerry Kranitz in the July 2002 issue of Aural Innovations:\n\n\n\nIf Chris Phinney brings out Hal's more space cosmic side, Brian Noring brings out the more avant-garde abstract sound sculpture side (not that Hal needs much encouragement for that). In fact, Random Sound Generator includes what looks like the whole Noring family, plus Phil Klampe and Dave Wren. Actually this set isn't nearly as harsh as a lot of McGee/Noring collaborations and what makes it particularly interesting is the expanded instrumentation like guitar, piano, percussion and what sounds like maybe some other string and wind instruments that add a free-improv musical element to the sound sculptures.\n\n\n\nSo we've got the classic Hal conversation samples, plus free-improv with guitar, percussion, flutes, keyboards and piano. The opening track, \"Window Shopping For Concepts\" is like Sun Ra meets the Residents in a crowded bar at a carnival. Two of my favorites are \"Himalayan Train Derailment\" and \"Searching For Lost Intentions\", both of which really highlight the free-improv musical jams combined with voice samples á la Hal's Wired For Sound CD (see review last issue). I particularly liked the former, which includes wild free-improv noise electronics and classical music. The deep bass has kind of a rocking chaotic Fred Frith sound and more of that Sun Ra out there jazzy organ and freeform/modern classical piano, some [relatively] ambient bits... and, of course, a non-stop parade of banging, clanging and assorted sounds. Overall, this CD may well be my favorite example of Hal's use of everyday sounds combined with sound sculptures and... GASP!... actual music. Hell, there's even bits of Blues guitar. Multiple listens will surely reveal something new every time.",

Recordings label.\n\n\n\nRandom dada collage accumulations of audio objects: tape recordings of-- shopping malls, convenience stores, flea markets, thrift and junk stores, coffee shops, restaurants, automobile and street sounds, walks in the park, cooking, cleaning, walking across the floor, muttering banalities, telephone answering machine messages; along with doodling and noodling cheap second-hand Casio and Yamaha keyboard atmospheres, banging on metal cans, microphone goofing, sound poetry, lo tech electronic noise manipulations -- all jumbled and heaped and piled and dumped together. Vertical and horizontal juxtapositional coaccidental cross-purposeful purposelessness, indeterminate as hell -- anything, everything and most definitely nothing.",

      "about": "MY BRAIN is 77 minutes in length and consists of two massive multi-tracked kaleidoscopic audio collages in the audio trash sculpture mode: \"Just Look At The Mess I Have Made!\" (31:04) and \"Propagation Disturbation\" (46:33). \n\nSeemingly-random jumbled heaps and piles and accumulations of sounds: piano improvisations, theremin, circuit bent Casio SK-1 and Speak & Spell, percussion, Moog Rogue analog synthesizer, flute, Casio VA-10 keyboard, Radio Shack Moog synthesizer, shortwave radio, Dark Star synth module (constructed by audio artist Dave Fuglewicz), spoken word (me reading out loud from e-mails I have sent, phrases from a poster in a veterinarian's office, random thoughts and memories and associations, dream recollections, descriptions of how the CD was constructed), audio tape field recordings of street and public transportation sounds and my work and home environments -- all mixified on a Fostex X-12 4-track cassette recorder and mastered directly to compact disc. \n\nCrazy, chaotic, an organized mess, kind of like a finger painting in sound. You will discover something new every time you listen to MY BRAIN, and I promise that you have never heard anything quite like it. Highly personal and abstract at the same time. Strong visual images in sound. Audio objects for your contemplation -- you can observe these audio objects in much the same way you would a painting or a sculpture or a random collection of objects in a roadside ditch or a trash dumpster. You complete the audio works by shaping them into sound forms in your mind. No beats, no melodies. \n\nThe painting of me on the cover is by Jimmy McCullough.\n\n\n\nreview by Jerry Kranitz in the August 2003 issue of Aural Innovations:\n\n[http://aural-innovations.com/2003/august/mcgee04.html}\n\n\n\nOf the many Hal McGee recordings I've heard over the past year and a half, Wired For Sound remains one of my favorites (see AI #19). A non-stop sound art piece detailing his daily life, the album consists of pasted together field recordings, spoken word, and day to day activities that make for a completely non-musical but fascinating sound experience. My Brain comes pretty close to that experience, though it's also one of Hal's most musical, with two lengthy slabs of sound collage that will simultaneously challenge and fry, not the brain of the title, but that of the listener.\n\n\n\n\"Just Look At The Mess [That] I Have Made!\" is a 31 minute piece with Hal glomming together spoken word, piano and synth noodlings, noise chaos, a banquet of sounds, and percussion from his brother Mark. Early in the recording Hal sets the tone by talking about the trivial sounds of everyday life that we ignore or try to ignore, the flow of consciousness chatter constantly going on in his head, shaping it all into sound forms, and promises a nice big chaotic mess. And Hal delivers on this promise. He brings together a parade of seemingly unrelated sounds... mad concert piano banging, wailing flutes or recorder, fluttering theremin, crashing percussion, efx'd voices, and lots of fun electro craziness. There are some quieter musical moments too where the focus is on the piano and percussion, giving it all a kind of insane asylum orchestral free-improv feel that I enjoyed.\n\n\n\nThe 46 minute \"Propagation Disturbation\" is similar, including more of the concert piano that we heard on the first track, theremin, alien synth tones, field recordings, spoken word and various other voices. There are some cool musical segments, some of which feature some fiery keyboard work, and combined with all the alien electro shenanigans we get a fairly wild blend. And we also get lots of those trivial everyday sounds that we tend to ignore, though in this context they're prominent amongst the many other layers of sound and therefore available for our consideration. This is abstract stuff and not for the impatient or fidgety listener, who is sure to wind up in a straight-jacket if he or she makes their way through the whole CD. But it's a fun and intriguing voyage for those who are willing to jump aboard Hal's cranium and not get too wrapped up with whether they can dissect or even understand it. It's just the sounds that make the world go ‘round and how it all looks inside Hal's brain.",

Single or slowly developing tones and noise waves are accompanied by busier and continually evolving sounds, along with all the otherworldly bleeps and blurps you could ever want. \"Suffering\" is a standout track featuring howling wind tunnel waves, brain shattering tones, mucho fun freaky Forbidden Planet sci fi electronics, and a faint pattern that reminds me of an old Alan Parsons tune on speed (last thing you were expecting huh?). \"Sway\" and \"Sweat\" are among the darker and more intense tracks, as well as featuring some of the more avant-garde sound sculptures, with their minimalist patterns and loads of banging and clattering on the former. An excellent set of electronic excursions that are deep in the chaotic (as opposed to ambient) realms of the cosmos.",

      "about": "Deep Space Search Engine by Hal McGee was originally released on CDR on the HalTapes label in 2002. Minimalist ambient drone trance psych noise space music.\n\n\n\nNotes by Hal McGee: \n\nMy method of composing the music on this CD was exceedingly (and deceptively) simple. Mostly using a cheap polyphonic synthesizer with a sustain pedal (and also a Moog synthesizer), I set up long drones of just two or three notes. These sounds were processed through a delay unit, with just a little tweaking and twiddling of the controls. I recorded the tracks on a 4-track cassette recorder. As I laid down each new track I never listened to what I had previously recorded. I was fascinated by the interplay of the tones, and of the track layers, and how they phased in and out with each other in a myriad ways. I just love stuff with a lot of details. If you listen to this CD at a fairly low volume it will work as an ambience, a general atmosphere. Turn up the volume, past where you would normally listen to music -- and you will hear a whole world, perhaps a whole galaxy of sound worlds. Macrocosmos or Microcosmos?\n\n\n\nReview of Deep Space Search Engine by Jerry Kranitz in the July 2002 issue of Aural Innovations:\n\n\n\n'The aptly titled Deep Space Search Engine is Hal's newest release and is among the most purely spaced of the music I've heard from him. The opening and closing tracks - \"To Travel In Space You Must Leave The Body\" and \"Radio Interference Grid\" - recall the glory days of electronic Krautrock but all within a very \"Hal\" context. The former features space electronics with several parallel and intertwining patterns that develop very slowly . The mechanical minimalist aspect reminds me a lot of Neu!, and the few discernible melodies have a Kraftwerk sound, though there are some dreamier elements as well. \"Radio Interference Grid\" is similar but with a modest \"rock\" element that brings to mind a blending of Neu!, Tangerine Dream and Amon Düül II.\n\n\n\nMost of the remaining tracks are similar but the focus is more on the gradual development of the minimal patterns, though \"Oscillating Universe\" does include bits of old time Krautrock and prog keyboard sounds. But with \"Comet Ikeya-Zhang\" we're getting more into what we'll call \"classic Hal\" territory. We're traveling on the tail of the comet and it's a raucous ride indeed. But then again you wouldn't expect to meditate while riding coach on a comet would you? It's full of slowly developing layers of drones, space waves, and noise. Yet despite the grating sounds it all still comes across as being very cerebral and ultimately accomplishes (though some will disagree) what space ambient music does. We'll call it noise-ambient. Overall an excellent set and a great starting point for the curious but tentative among you who would like to get their feet wet in Hal's music.'",

      "about": "Maps Of Nowhere consists of four long tracks distilled from 12 hours of field recordings made on a handheld cassette recorder - recorded August through October 2000.\n\n\n\nLots of shortwave radio tones and static; surreptitious recordings from my work environment in a hospital; quotidian, found and trash sounds: alarm clock, Hare Krishna chanting, public transportation, street & traffic noises, toys, children, family, howling maniac dogs, mundane conversations -- audio ethnographic recordings from the streets, alleys, sidewalks, parking lots, and fields of Gainesville, Florida -- all blended, multitracked and contorted into big concrete music noisy cut-up collages.\n\n\n\nI employed chance process, aleatory and automatistic methods of dada and surrealism in the making of Maps Of Nowhere.\n\n\n\nConstructed on a Fostex XR-5 4-track cassette recorder.\n\n\n\nReview by Jerry Kranitz in Aural Innovations #20, April 2002:\n\nA collage of noise, voice samples, and in the background early on it sounds like some old American folk or chanting religious song. I hear sirens, traffic, and samples from the radio, implying some distorted urban landscape. But things are at various points in the recording somewhat more tangible as we hear Hal's conversations with people at work and other places. It's amazing how sensitive a tape recorder can be, and the slightest shuffling of objects is as prominent in volume as are the conversations. Though the noise is... well, noise... it isn't grating though it can certainly be brain-piercing. How, you ask, can sounds be brain-piercing but not grating? Well, it's hard to explain but my brain perceives a difference between the two. Grating is when you just have this huge sonic wall of noise all blended together and the listener is completely unable to distinguish between multiple sounds. So even though things get pretty chaotic on Maps Of Nowhere, I feel myself getting involved in Hal's world when I can distinguish and even recognize many of the layers and elements that make up the whole. The voices, the drones, the whistles, the traffic.... and so on. If you're relaxed and let your imagination go then a parade of surprisingly concrete images will formulate in your mind. It's difficult to describe the aesthetics of pure sound, especially when those sounds happen to be a tad harsh.",

      "about": "Wired For Sound is one of my favorite recordings in my catalog and in many ways is a seminal Hal McGee audio work. Presented here for the first time ever online, Wired For Sound was originally released by Phil Klampe on his 6 On The Dot label, on homemade CDr. Recorded in its entirety on a Sony Cassette-Corder TCM-453V handheld mono cassette recorder, using only the built-in condenser microphone - TDK D Normal Bias tape ->> March-April 2000.\n\n\n\nKey words and terms: dada, fluxus, cassette art, collage, cut-ups, spontaneous, beat poetry, audio ethnography, juxtapositions, shortwave radio (the use of which connects the worldwide/universal with the personal/local), sidewalk audio art, Kurt Schwitters, Jean Dubuffet, assemblage, quotidian.\n\n\n\nHere is a review by Jerry Kranitz in Aural Innovations # 19: \"...the disc opens with Hal stating, \"Sounds on a tape. Sounds on a tape\". And that's precisely what this is... sounds on a tape. We hear Hal's spoken word, we join him in the bathroom, hear him in conversation with his niece and others... loads and loads of pasted together field recordings. I remember when I was little my grandfather had this old reel-to-reel and I'd record for hours, getting something similar to what Hal has of his niece. I'd go on endlessly about imaginary friends and such, but in my teen years my grandfather made the mistake of giving me and my sisters the reel-to-reel and all the tapes... all of which we promptly taped over. Boy do I regret that now. But I digress. One of the interesting things about Wired For Sound is the (I presume) deliberately choppy way in which Hal edits together the various bits that make up the CD, which gives it a raw quality that makes things a bit jarring throughout and, given that I was listening with headphones, a little dizzying as well. I described hearing something similar on Maps Of Nowhere, though Wired For Sound largely dispenses with the sonic explorations in favor of a focus on words, poetry, and day-to-day sounds and activities. It seems chaotic as hell and I found it difficult to listen to the entire 70 minutes in one sitting, but on a voyeuristic level it's quite cohesive and probably my favorite of all Hal's works I've heard. I felt like I was following Hal around hiding in the bushes as he experiences a typical day, presented against a wildly surreal backdrop.\" \n\n\n\nHere is an excerpt from a review by Swami Loopynanda: \"On this CD McGee breaks through to an environment where most listeners might feel a bit uncomfortable. Nevertheless, those audiophiles out there who are truly looking for a unique experience should check this one out. Using only a handheld monophonic tape recorder, Hal pastes together literally hundreds of chunks of found sounds into an exhibition of nothing less than his own everyday reality. All of these rough chunks are separated by the noises of the tape recorder being turned on and off, giving the entire CD a primitive ambience, uncharacteristic of today's technologically washed recordings.\"\n\n\n\nGibberish and glossolalia, cut-up improvised fourth generation beat sidewalk poetry; emergency vehicle sirens and other urban noise pollution; shortwave radio bursts; and a four year old girl's meditations on the universe, trees, clouds, butterflies and lemonade.",

      "about": "Abfall Man was a self-produced compact disc by Hal McGee, recorded and released in 2001. Abfall Man was Part One of a trilogy of CDs called My Intellectual Property. This noise-trash-monster of an album was constructed on a 4-track cassette recorder with dense layers of handheld cassette recordings of urban noise, everyday sounds, and shortwave radio tones and static. Abfall Man is meant to be experienced as one continuous 72 minute audiowork. It is, however, divided up into 19 tracks of arbitrary length. The listener can play the tracks in straight sequence or in shuffle mode for varying effects.\n\n\n\nDownload the album to view full-size scans of the original CD artwork.",

      "about": "Summit was recorded Saturday, October 11, 1997 at F.D.R. Studios in Des Moines, Iowa. 92 minutes, originally released on cassette.\n\n\n\nThis was a momentous \"summit meeting\" of homemade audio artist friends of mine:\n\n\n\nCharles Rice Goff III, who was a member of Herd Of The Ether Space and operated the Taped Rugs Productions label\n\nPhil Klampe, who recorded under the name Homogenized Terrestrials and ran the 6 On The Dot label\n\nBrian Noring, whose F.D.R. Recordings label was a mid-1990s powerhouse of homemade music,\n\nand who with his friend, Shawn Kerby recorded as a duo called 360 Sound.\n\nIn the 1980s I recorded under the name of Dog As Master. And that is how we arrived at the name Herd Of 360 Homogenized Dogs.\n\n\n\nThis is one of my favorite recordings in my catalog and one that I feel has stood the test of time and still sounds good 14 years later. Exotic, surreal, primitive and otherworldly, bizarre but never harsh, Summit is a marvel of minimalist ambient sound exploration. It is truly a one of a kind recording. It sounds amazingly good for five musicians who had never played together as a group before. I had never met Goff and Klampe before this day, although we had traded and shared lots of cassette releases over the years.\n\n\n\nWe recorded five free improvisations that day in two adjoining rooms of Brian Noring's house in Des Moines, playing instruments and sound-making gadgets supplied by Goff, Klampe, Noring and myself. We switched places and instruments on each of the five pieces.\n\n\n\nDownload the album for pictures in the zip file.\n\n\n\ngear supplied by Noring:\n\nTechnics RS-TR252 Cassette Deck, Yamaha MT50 Multitrack Cassette Recorder, Digitech RP5 Effects Processor, Radio Shack DX-350, Shortwave Radio, Lotus Electric Guitar, Franciscan Acoustic Guitar, Atus ATR 30 Cardioid Low Impedance Microphone, Videoke Uni-Directional Dynamic DM-3100 500 Microphone\n\n\n\nsupplied by McGee:\n\nBig Briar (Moog) EtherWave Theremin\n\n\n\nsupplied by Klampe:\n\nTascam 424 4-Track Cassette Recorder, Roland JP-8000 Synthesizer\n\n\n\nsupplied by Goff:\n\nYamaha FX500 Simul-Effect Processor, Realistic 4 Channel Stereo Microphone Mixer, AIWA HS-J370A Stereo Radio Cassette Recorder, Shure PE 515 Microphone, Chinese Baby Rattle, Dinner Bell, Jamaican Maraca, Mega Mouth, Sound World, Vietnamese Jews Harp, Tin Whistle, Wooden Flute, Adjustable-Barrel Recorder, Pig Trumpet, Squeaky Bird Toy, Mini-Hammer Of Doom, Kazoo, Wooden Xylophone, Shelving Fasteners, Rocket Ratchet, Frog Clicker, Remo Racquet Drum, Uni-Cymbal Stick, Plastic Ocarina, Tapes.",

      "about": "Alien Progeny is a possible soundtrack to alien abduction and UFO lab experimentation on human subjects, cold, mechanistic, minimalistic, abstract dark ambient electronic soundscapes. Alien Progeny by Hal McGee and Phil Klampe (Homogenized Terrestrials) was originally released on CDR on the 6 On The Dot and HalTapes labels in 1998. The source recordings were made in Gainesville, Florida in May of that year and remixed by Klampe in Peru, Illinois in June and July. The album was Homemade Alien Music Volume 3, following Volume 1, which was a split CD with McGee, E H I and Separation, and Volume 2, which was Ancient Astronauts by Phinney/McGee.\n\nThe \"theme\" of the album was one I explored numerous times, that today's experimental musicians are the offspring of alien encounters, which, though fanciful, is as likely an explanation as any other for the strange sounds emanating from bedrooms and living rooms across Planet Earth.",

      "about": "Recorded during the Summer of 1998, 1909E is an album of sounds recorded in and around my one bedroom apartment in Gainesville, Florida, where I lived from January 1992 to March 2011. It was created on a Fostex XR-5 4-track cassette recorder.\n\n\n\nDownload the album to view artwork files.\n\n\n\nThe opening track, \"The Soundtrack To The Television Special About The Making Of 'The Sushi That Ate Tokyo' \", starts out with overlapping layers of shortwave radio transmissions and Casio VA-10 keyboard feedback and tonal bursts -- and later segues into tapes of dogs barking and spoken word statements about the importance of saying nothing.\n\n\n\n\"Electric Eels\" is a 23 minute electronic jam with rippling pulsating bass synth patterns, overlaid with chaotic Moog flourishes and swirlicues and white noise drones, theremin swoops, over the top of refrains from \"The Sushi That Ate Tokyo\".\n\n\n\n\"The Dog Bites Back\" is another 23 minute excursion -- this time with sustained organ tones that crash into discord collisions -- with spoken word importance of saying nothing refrains -- with arbitrarily inserted tapes of apartment yard lawn blowers, barking howling dogs, screaming children, airplanes overhead, and mundane discussions with a neighbor about Fall weather and how our dogs eat grass to settle their stomachs but most of the time just vomit it up...\n\n\n\n\"Marijuanalysis\" (Parts 2 & 1) is a multi-tracked spoken word tape collage of my ruminations about how the use of marijuana, by short-circuiting short-term memory, causes the user to experience the mundane and everyday in more detail, and other nonsense about espresso and various subjects.\n\n\n\n1909E is one of my most dadaistic works, and also one which seeks to blend electronic synthesis and sound-making and with tape collage treatments of daily sounds.",

      "about": "H8 (originally recorded and released on cassette in May 1998) is an audio work which addresses itself as an avant garde experimental electronic music work. A collection of tape fragments of heavily-processed alarm clock radio noise and static and ear-scraping feedback -- but also spoken word segments which refer to the process of creating an audio work, as well as tapes of everyday sounds and conversations.\n\nIs H8 seriocomic or comically seriously, or just seriously ABOUT everything and nothing at the same time? Are the H and the 8 a mere letter and numeral, or do they refer to hate (and if hate, hate of whom (myself, others, everybody, nobody) or what?).\n\n\n\nAround that time I was attempting to write a book about my experiences as a home audio artist. On my numerous walks with my dog I carried an old shoebox-style Panasonic cassette recorder, like people used to use to record lectures and such. As I walked along I would turn the tape recorder on and extemporaneously recall details of various tape projects from the early 1980s. Well, the project of writing the book ran out of steam. I had hours and hours of tapes lying around. I decided to cut them up with harsh bare bones cut-ins of live electronics.\n\nI used my Casio VA-10 keyboard (which has a microphone input and 60 on-board digital effects) to process sounds from my alarm clock radio. I also used the VA-10's microphone and effects to modulate feedback running through my stereo system's speakers. I ruined my stereo speakers in the process, blowing out the tweeters!\n\nI also added on vocal parts processed through the VA-10 which refer to \"Rose Palmer\", my beloved right hand, which gives me so much pleasure.\n\nAdditionally you will hear recordings of my vacuum cleaner, audio white noise from a TV I never used, amplified humming from my audio system, a phone call to my mom, a conversation with a neighbor who is really pissed off about a busted drug deal, sirens, dogs barking.\n\nAnd all of the sounds mentioned above keep getting cut in with bits from the audio book notes about creating audio tape works, which in the first place did not refer to the present work (H8), but seem to refer to it any way, or something like that... and laser beams, and atoms and how the listener of avant garde music must be an active listener, and about how the mind searches for patterns in chaos.\n\nWell, you get the (audio) picture, don't you?\n\n\n\nOne of the greatest of all experimental recordings... both personal and totally original. -- Brian Noring",

      "about": "Lobhia aur khumbi was recorded Easter Sunday, April 12, 1998 at HalTapes Headquarters, Gainesville, Florida. The name of the CD came from an Indian cuisine dish that I prepared for our lunch that day (see pictures in downloaded zip file)\n\n\n\nThis day's recording was the culmination of a long, fun weekend that included the Thursday and Friday sessions that produced Alien Progeny by McGee and Phil Klampe, as well as the Good Friday evening sessions for the 3-way collab of Goff, Klampe, and McGee, called Unholy Trinity. \n\n\n\nOn Saturday Goff and McGee traveled to the east central coast of Florida to visit the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday morning Goff prepared a special breakfast of marijuana pancakes, which supplied sufficient provocation to record the four pieces you hear here.\n\n\n\nAll of the material on Lobhia aur khumbi was recorded or constructed on cassette. We used a Fostex XR-5 4-track cassette recorder and handheld cassette tape recorders.\n\n\n\n\"Magnetic Fields Forever\" made its initial online appearance on Charlie Goff's Taped Rugs Productions podcast. Here is how he described the piece:\n\n\n\nThe first piece presented here, “Magnetic Fields Forever”, is a mix of two sessions in which McGee played a theremin and Goff a [Radio Shack] bio feedback generator. Because both of these “instruments” create their sounds without keys, frets, mouthpieces, sticks, picks, etc., the performance of this extremely spacey music resembled a dance, in which Goff and McGee moved about with Merce Cunninghamesque contortions.\n\n\n\n\"Taped To The Jolly Cross\" also made its initial online appearance on Goff's podcast, and here is how he described it:\n\n\n\nThe second piece presented here, “Taped To The Jolly Cross”, looked more like a sporting event as it was being performed. For this one, the two experimenters went out to the apartment complex’s handball court to smack and kick tennis balls and tin cans. Portable tape recorders were set up at either end of the court, and their recordings were mixed together to create the final piece.\n\n\n\nIn the last two pics in the zip file you see Charlie and me with the delicious Indian vegetarian lunch I prepared for us while we were in the midst of recording \"Magnetic Fields Forever\". The menu consisted of homemade naan bread, lobhia aur khumbi (which is a tasty dish of black-eyed peas, mushrooms, and tomatoes), some spinach dish I can't remember the name of, Basmati rice, and a way yummy cauliflower and potato dish that is one of my favorites.",

Side B consists of four 4-track experimental electronic space music scapes. All sounds on this album, including voice, were processed through or created on the Casio VA10 keyboard, an amazing and rare Casio instrument, not only carrying Casio's usual array of 100 onboard \"voices\", but also 60 built-in onboard digital effects, including \"vocoder\" settings. I bought my VA10 in a Casio closeout store in Orlando, Florida in 1996.",

      "about": "Fester was the first Phinney/McGee collaboration after my three year hiatus from recording & releasing (1992-1995). This 60-minute cassette is a flowing mail collab collage of spoken words by Phinney and myself, field recordings, minimal electronics, synthscapes, manipulated samples, smoke detectors, answering machine messages, etc. After a hiatus of four years Phinney/McGee returned with this mail collaboration recorded in early 1996. It's an unusual work for Phinney/McGee: in essence a 60 minute tape collage of fragments from daily life, lo tech electronics, keyboards and samples. The fragments repeat over and over throughout the course of the work in varying patterns. Side B includes Mike Honeycutt on some keyboards.",

      "about": "After my three year hiatus from recording (92-95) I noticed that a lot of noise artists were doing special deluxe package releases. It seemed like every fuckin' release by Aube had like a dead fish attached to it or a pubic hair or a bag of sewage water or some such shit with deluxe printed sleeve, etc etc etc. I purposely made the cover of my \"B12\" cassette as shitty and amateurish-looking as possible and I fit four of them onto one sheet of paper so that at Kinko's each cover would end up costing me like 2.5 cents. I sent a copy of \"B12\" to Aube as a trade and told him here is my \"anti-deluxe two and a half cent cover\". He was not amused and told me he would not trade with me again. This is the same young upstart who had told me previously that I had been one of his influences from the 1980s. Hahahaha. Uppity bastard!\n\n\n\nOriginally released on cassette in 1995. \"Hal McGee's first solo work since 1988. A self-described mix of post, pre, dis, un and de- constructed space noise and ambient industrial. If that's just enough to confuse you it's a perfect description for this excellent bout sonic assembly. McGee delivers fat, noisy, crashing barrages alongside analog ambient space pieces and makes it work. At times a seemingly haphazard piecing together of the master destroys whatever groove develops, but that's half the fun. I was impressed with the clean, solid recording -- this stuff really sounds huge. Certainly for braver souls up for the challenge but not inaccessible to those sneaking a peek. Go ahead, give it try.\" Reviewed by Bryan Baker in Gajoob, 2/18/1996.",

Heavy Moog synthesizer soundscapes mixed with cut and paste tape collages, oblique spoken word interjections. Powerful, propulsive, fiery. A good example of my work that burns with \"positive anger\". Originally released on cassette in 1986, C53, on the Cause And Effect label.\n\n\n\nreview by Allen Densen, Black Orbit Newsletter, Canada, 1986\n\nA set of four harsh electronic pieces to wake the neighbors. The first track, 'gauge', is an industrial sequencer piece; the next two are fascinating sound destructions with meticulous layout and editing; and the final track, 'eclipse', could be described as the noisiest death knell I've ever heard. Hal McGee could be the J.S. Bach of Industrial electronics.",

      "about": "Originally released on cassette on the Cause And Effect label in 1986.\n\n\n\nDownload the album to view Debbie Jaffe's original booklet layouts in the zip file.\n\n\n\nJapanese audio artist compilation with tracks by Toshifumi Kawase, The Joke Project, Tetsuya Fukui, Satoshi Hashimoto, Merzbow, Ice 9, Takahashi Numazawa Hashimoto, O’Nancy in French, Monomagnon, Masaki Eguti. A wide variety of styles from guitar pop instrumentals, to tape collage, electroacoustic, improvisation, vocal solos, lots more.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nReview of Best Text Of Japan by The Electrician (Chris Johnston), November 28, 2015: \n\nrateyourmusic.com/release/album/various_artists_f2/best_text_of_japan/\n\n\n\n Over the last few weeks I've been exploring Bandcamp a lot more and I'm beginning to realise what a fantastic source of rare and out-of-print material it can be. Take this gem for instance, a long lost cassette compilation from 1986 now lovingly restored in digital format by the seemingly indefatigable Hal McGee. I was drawn to it initially by the presence of three Merzbow tracks but as with many other compilations that Masami Akita appears on, it is the opportunity to discover a number of other new artists where the real appeal lies.\n\n\n\nBest Text of Japan blends musique concrète, improvised noise and Krautrock elements, throwing up a few surprises along the way. It opens with \"Sex\" by Toshifumi Kawase and where you might expect an immediate assault on the ear drums you are presented instead with a delightful instrumental piece pairing acoustic guitar with low-key electronics. The Merzbow tracks are interesting enough and the Krautrock rhythms of Takahashi Numawaza Hashimoto are strangely appealing. However, top billing must go to the wonderfully named O'Nancy in French. Their three noise tracks are by turns hypnotic, atmospheric and utterly compelling.\n\n\n\nLike many good archival releases this download album allows you to peek inside what seems like a lost sound-world. It's a great advert for the Japanoise scene of the mid 1980s and an equally good advert for the work of Hal McGee in continuing to document this kind of material and make it available to intrepid Bandcamp explorers. I'm the first person to bemoan the death of physical records but albums like this show that downloads too can be a thing of wonder.\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nPlease note that \"Venoayasama\" by Merzbow is not listed as a track in the audio files. It is indeed included in the listening material, but I am not sure if it is at the end of \"Smichion\" or the beginning of \"small motor-byke...\".",

      "about": "Brash Pussy (1985) is a 30-minute massive sound destruction collage (that prefigured much of today's Noise music) that explodes into chaotic frenzied foaming at the mouth lust-rage. Tapes of Turkish music, synthesizers, percussion, one particularly nasty phrase screamed over and over again (an aural ejaculation of lust, inspired by Debbie Jaffe). Noise filth sound damage with a wry grin. A satire of sorts of power electronics and its concomitant obsessions of perversion, hard sex and sodomy. Brash Pussy was originally released on the French power electronics/noise label 3AP/Le Syndicat, Paris in 1985, and later by Sound Of Pig Music in 1986 as a C59. Side B (part 2) is Side A backwards.\n\n\n\nI wanna dedicate this special love song to all of the ladies in the audience. \n\n\n\n\"Quite simply one of the greatest albums ever made.\" -- Travis Johnson, Ilse Records, September 18, 2011. \n\n\n\n\"What a sound! The primal human rage, the emotion erupting through shards of feedback and heavy distortions must be heard as a stunning precursor to such vocal feedback artists as Masonna and Prurient.\"\n\n-- PBK, 2010. \n\n\n\nReview of Dog As Master: Brash Pussy, by Andrew McIntosh \n\n... said to be a \"satire of sorts of power electronics and its concomitant obsessions of perversion, hard sex and sodomy\". The thing with satire, though, is it is in the ears of the listener. To mine, this is a fulsome, well structured and nicely paced rage of early Harsh Noise, composed of distorted synths, tapes, and vocals - a repeated phrase that's difficult to hear but is apparently \"an aural ejaculation of lust\" to McGee's one time partner and collaborator Debbie Jaffe. Considering this pre-dates a lot of Harsh Noise by at least half a decade it's amazing how full and layered it sounds. Certainly, the sound is not the kind of up-front, crisp harshness many are used to by now, but nor is it totally mired in low fidelity (contrived or otherwise). There are variations of hissing, gurgling, squawking, moaning and roaring sounds that chase each other and yet give each other space. Interestingly, around the twenty minute mark the volume fades down - not sure if that's deliberate but it sounds as if it is - before fading back up again. The last few minutes towards the end generate some very satisfying grinding electronic harshness. Hal's mood, seemingly a combination of lust and hate, is a timeless theme with Power Electronics, and thus this \"satire\" is closer to the core than perhaps intended. Certainly there's no attempt to be \"Power Electronics\" with this, that I hear. It's more a serious attempt to really let out some certain aggression, and it's that realistic honesty that comes forward as the main current. But even leaving that aside, this is grandiose, synthesised Noise that can be appreciated and enjoyed on it's own audial level.\n\n-- review published on Special Interests message board.",

      "about": "NO AUDIO!\n\n\n\nA Whole Universe Of Horror Movies has been moved to the Cause And Effect site on Bandcamp \n\ncauseandeffectk7.bandcamp.com/album/a-whole-universe-of-horror-movies\n\n\n\n HalTapes\n\nHT004\n\n\n\nA Whole Universe Of Horror Movies was the second full length tape by Viscera, Debbie Jaffe and Hal McGee. It has always been my favorite Viscera tape, and it is the work in which our main themes reach their fullest expression. Gothic minimal synth industrial. Twisted poetic vocalizations over synth backings of Moog Prodigy and Casio MT-11, clarinet, drum machine and tape loops. It was recorded in 1983, and released in early 1984, on cassette, C55. Re-released by Harsh Reality Music in 1990.\n\n\n\nfrom the January 1985 Cause And Effect catalog:\n\nIN A FOREIGN FILM led the listener to the brink of insanity; this cassette jumps out over \"the edge\". The heavily vocal-oriented, extremely minimal stylizations of Jaffe & McGee have drawn comparisons to Cultural Amnesia, DDAA, Nico, Lemon Kittens, Young Marble Giants, The Velvets and others. \"The emphasis here is on the atmosphere created by first the twisted poetic words; then the music kind of takes the whole thing a step downwards into despair.\" (No Commercial Potential).\n\n\n\nA Whole Universe Of Horror Movies was the second full length tape by Debbie Jaffe and myself recorded under the name Viscera. It has always been my favorite Viscera tape, and it is the work in which our main themes reach their fullest expression. It was recorded in 1983, and released in early 1984.\n\nHorror Movies is also our most accessible and melodic work. Like its predecessor, In A Foreign Film, Horror Movies was mostly recorded live through a stereo microphone directly to a cassette deck. So, much of the primitive sound of Foreign Film is still here, but there is a greater refinement and confidence to the performances.\n\nA Whole Universe Of Horror Movies is almost unrelentingly morbid, dark and dreary. Debbie and I dressed in black quite a lot, smoke and drank heavily, and generally were pretty damn depressed and morose. Horror Movies not only dwells on but revels in the dark side of the psyche.\n\nFor the Whole Universe Of Horror Movie sessions we borrowed a Moog Prodigy synthesizer from our friend Roberta Eklund, and we gave it quite a workout. You can hear Debbie playing it on the opening track, \"Blank Faces Of The Others\", with me on our trusty Casio MT-11, on a fog-enshrouded instrumental that sets the tone for what will follow.\n\nAll of the songs on the first side of the tape form a suite, with each piece flowing into the next one, with a sustained ominous sense of foreboding.\n\nThe second song, \"Something Else Strangely Familiar\", is fairly short, and another introduction of sorts. Over minimal bass synth figures I declaim a text from an advertisement we found in the newspaper. We had done this quite a lot before -- lift a mundane text from advertising and the mass media and re-contextualized it, subverting the meaning and creating an ironic twist on the intentions of the words:\n\n\"Don't guess wrong / We're not going to give you any magical or supernatural powers / All we are going to do is show you how to use a highly effective little known principal that is available to any man...\"\n\n\n\nThe text of \"Honest / Dishonest\" came from my experiences applying for a job at a major department store in Indianapolis. They gave the applicants a personality assessment questionnaire to fill out. You were asked a number of questions about stealing and questions of honesty and character. Such as: Would you report a co-worker if you saw them stealing? Or is it all right to steal something if the value of the item is more or less than a certain dollar amount? And so on. And the survey would ask you the same questions several times with different wording -- trying to catch you being inconsistent, or trying to beat the test. The text of the song addresses the dichotomy between honesty and dishonesty, and being honest about one's dishonesty and dishonest about one's honesty. Over dreary synth drone patterns I intoned like a dark priest:\n\n\"I am honest / I am dishonest / I get high / I get low / I get dumb / I move slow / I'm an idiot; I love to steal / I'm basically dishonest / I'm wrong-minded / I got a set of totally insane ideas / I always think of myself before I think of others/ What would you do? / What in fact do you do? / You lie, you cheat, you steal ...\" and so on.\n\n\n\n\"Bones Are Chairs\" is the most light-hearted song on the tape, but even then it leaves the listener wondering with an uneasy feeling as to the singer's intentions. Over a crazy bagpipe-like synth figure and over-dubbed clarinet fillips, I sang my dada nightclub bit, in one of my \"Monty Python voices\":\n\n\"Bones are chairs spilling spilling across oceans that would invite unusable poems over for dinner / pounds and pounds of flesh / then insult them for not wearing the lapel pins that say: Yes, I am in the corner squatting squatting squatting today / My bones sing tunes that are like investments in radical smoke-tasting stocks and bonds oops crash who smile and wave at the crowds while private yes they're unwashedly reminding themselves how much much mooch they hate feminist stomping on this little insignificant little scrawny little measly little not mine, little most certainly yours / Little most certainly your penis / and that elephantitic bouncy bouncy balls in a sack with your fruits and your veggies and fruits and your veggies and fruits and your veggies, oh yeah! / Rate the yellow smack the hand that reaches for naughty things / No date no time no memorization no recitation just elbow-yanking / piss ocean qualm / We don't use that thing, and any way, somebody broke it!\"\n\n\n\nOn \"Ugly Talk\" we do our very worst/best Throbbing Gristle imitation in an examination of political doublespeak. Over Deb's droning synth bass and primitive tape loop I intone words by Jaffe:\n\n\"This man's not happy with this beat / Doesn't say what he thinks of politics / Brother, open your throat for dead things / Say things to regret / Then bury it / Ugly talk / Approving it this morning / Running to the person who makes the laws / Running into ruining / Ugly talk / I will give you a message / Be willing to do anything it says / Be willing to talk ugly talk ...\" Etc.\n\n\n\nAnd from there, the mood slides further and further into the pit. Over a plodding synth figure and fluttering speeded-up drum machine pattern, I sing a tune that sounds suspiciously like \"Both Sides Now\" by Joni Mitchell, as sung by Genesis P-Orridge, with cut & paste words by Debbie:\n\n\"Juices / I don't know what's upside down / Do I have anything to read? / I'm nervous as hell / Punitive manslaughter / Beefed-up juices / Grab a piece of art / The wrong side vetoed out / Slid down the hill / I don't know where they landed / The governor reads the newspaper for all his information exclusive / A dumb-dumb gives off a slice form without grace / Dinner is served late today / We'll be talked about / We'll seep deep into the ground / Split pea soup, jam, purple salt, people seasoned and tart / It simmers tenderly / Two people slide together killing each other instantly... \" Etc.\n\n\n\nThe text of \"Failing\" is a collage of writings by both Deb and me, and addresses the utter failure of the self to confront its own shortcomings, failures, and the void within. Deb's words set the tone:\n\n\"I looked around for something to believe in / I didn't find anything / Look at me saying this / I can't believe it... / Save me / God help me they said/ And all was lost/ Your character tells those around you keep away / We're all animals without repentance...\"\n\nIn the bridge I cackle demonically some words I wrote about how:\n\n\"Mr. Whip gets to smacking his lips / Drooling over dead birds / I get them and strike them / Light them, you believe me? / Up all night swinging like an idiot / Fat is as fat smells and I smell death in a pot of stewed meat ...\"\n\n\n\nIf that isn't morose, morbid and death-and-insanity-loving for you, the title track goes right off the edge into the abyss of self-extinction, with distinct resonances of William Burroughs and J.G. Ballard (a la Crash). The narrator has reached the point of total collapse, with no defenses and no resistance left, no more lies, no more excuses. He/she cowers in a corner waiting for apocalypse and the end of life and time:\n\n\"I want to die / I feel like I'm gonna get my wish ...\"\n\n\"Acid flashback / Perverted soundtracks / Screaming and throbbing and thrashing about / Tongues lolling around in slimy holes / Does anything intelligible bloody wound in rearview mirror get away with anything? / Something like mutant meat communication / Gaps in the instinct film / Totally mad addictive behavior / Transmuted again from refrain and message to message / back again into the mass hypnotic maw / Spewing out vomit cartilage and bone ...\"\n\nLater -- \"The tape is our effect / A whole universe of horror movies / The things that were destroyed with no completion / My broken nose / My broken back / Black potatoes / My black lungs / And airplane psychiatric mad religious art / Disgusting and vile / assassinate copying machine mentality! ... \"\n\n\n\nThe second side of A Whole Universe Of Horror Movies opens with two short instrumentals. My \"Shards\" is a free improvisation exploration on piano, with lots of pounding, changes in tempo and textures. This kind of free form piano piece has cropped up again and again in my work over the years.\n\n\n\nMany of the other songs on Horror Movies sound like they could have come from the In A Foreign Film sessions. I do my wistful introspective sounding vocal on \"Changing Minds\". Deb does vocals on two tracks, She does her wild screaming warbling Yoko Ono style on \"Last Wish\", and the long-lost lonely little woeful girl singing on a porch in the rain style on the final track, \"Geometry\". I take a turn at the synth and instrumentation on these. On \"Last Wish\" I do a particularly gnarly noisy all-over-the-place Moog part.\n\n\n\n\"The Box Is Green\" is a song about the futility of the American political process and how it is too mired in money and the concerns of the wealthy and big corporations. On this one I do my Ian Curtis / blues singer imitation.\n\n\n\nWe were very proud that A Whole Universe Of Horror Movies was distributed by Aeon Distribution of Ft. Collins, Colorado, just like In A Foreign Film.\n\n\n\nA Whole Universe Of Horror Movies is the last of what might be considered the Early Period of Viscera. Things would change drastically on Who Is This One and Hot And Cold.",

Very few people have actually heard this 90-minute tape over the years, but I like it a lot and I want to share it with you here. Minimalist, pulsing, drone-based electronic music that slowly changes over time. Repeating, slowly-evolving phase pattern music created with a Casio MT-11 keyboard, Moog Synthesizer, and a small amplifier - along with some experiments in feedback modulation. Not exactly ambient, because it contains abrasive textures. The music here pre-figures several of my later releases of aggressive minimalist electronics, such as Deep Space Search Engine. Occupant was a one-off solo side project - kind of proto-Dog As Master.",

      "about": "NO AUDIO!\n\n\n\nWho Is This One has been moved to the Cause And Effect site on Bandcamp \n\ncauseandeffectk7.bandcamp.com/album/who-is-this-one\n\n\n\n HalTapes\n\nHT006\n\n\n\nOctober 19, 2013 - New digital masters added of the two sides of the cassette in continuous format, without track markers, so that you can experience Who Is This One in its original conceptual flow.\n\n\n\nOctober 18, 2013 - Expanded text added.\n\n\n\nWho Is This One, originally released in 1984, was the third full-length cassette release by the duo of Hal McGee and Debbie Jaffe, and the first recorded with a 4-track cassette recorder (a Fostex X-15). Originally released by Cause And Effect. Re-released by Harsh Reality Music in 1990.\n\n\n\nIn the Spring of 1984 we bought several pieces of new equipment, probably right after we received our income tax return check. We purchased a Moog Rogue analog synthesizer (new for about $320 from a shop in Noblesville, Indiana), a Fostex 3050 digital delay rack mount unit, and a used set of Pearl Syncussion synthesizer drums.\n\n\n\nMore significantly, we acquired our first multi-track tape recorder, a Fostex X-15 4-track cassette recorder, for something like $450. The 4-track cassette recorder was a real breakthrough for home recording artists: multi-track recording at a reasonable price. This opened up all kinds of possibilities and newfound freedom to explore new sound dimensions.\n\n\n\nI argued with Debbie against buying a 4-track recorder. I can vividly remember sitting with Deb and our friend Toby O'Brien near a fountain at the Lafayette Square shopping mall in Indianapolis. I just kept saying over and over again that getting a 4-track recorder would 'change things'. Up to this point most all of our recordings together as Viscera (our first two tapes In A Foreign Film and A Whole Universe Of Horror Movies) were essentially recorded live direct to tape through a stereo microphone, with both of us playing and vocalizing, at the same time, in the same room. I feared that if we started using a multi-track recorder that the direct, 'real' genuineness of our artistic expression would be compromised. So much of the Viscera sound up to this point had relied on the intuitive interaction between Deb and I as we spontaneously created our songs and sound poems. \n\n\n\nThis is significant because the pieces on Who Is This One were composed or conceived by one of the other of us. On most of the pieces one of us would record three of four tracks on the 4-track recorder and then ask the other person to add sounds in the fourth track. I'm not sure, but in fact I seem to recall that a few of the tracks were recorded completely by one of us.\n\n\n\nSo, over the years it has been too easy for me to think of the songs on Who Is This One as being solo tracks with a guest appearance by the other member of Viscera. In retrospect I think that this attitude is maybe a little unfair. I do believe, however, that a case can be made for Who Is This One being the branching off point for our two solo projects - Master/Slave Relationship, and Dog As Master. The 4-track cassette recorder gave both of us the opportunity to conceptualize and carefully build up an audio piece in bits and pieces and layers. This gave both of us a great sense of independence, and stimulated our growth as individual artists.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the first side of Who Is This One is in many ways a continuous suite of pieces, the overall structure and concept of which Debbie meticulously designed. We can hear the roots of the Master/Slave Relationship sound in the various introspective, pensive, melancholic, and even sex-obsessed demonism textures and treatments and environments. Deb's vocalizations are much more aggressive, distorted and chorus-layered on Who Is This One, in stark contrast to the warbly sing-song bird little-girl waif personages that she depicted on the first two Viscera tapes.\n\n\n\nThe opening track, \"Clipboard Bodies\", is absolutely stunning in its thickly-layered Siren and Wraith -like chant-sung choruses. It's kind of got that black witches' sabbath sound with a steaming cauldron of venom and spew thing going on.\n\n\n\nThere's this whole sex and death and blood and sweat and cum stew bubbling throughout Side A. But there's more than that. There's also isolation and alienation, wispy fog-shrouded landscapes threaded through with a plaintive reedy horn. Drum machine and electronic percussion provide a surge and scum-muck beat to the pulsing blood of turgid swollen eroticism, hate and despair.\n\n\n\nWho Is This One continues with many of the same dark contemplative themes we had already explored, but with less innocence and naivete, and a good deal more calculation for certain effects.\n\n\n\nThe second side of the tape is full on apocalyptic scenes as humanity gets swallowed up, extinguished by the rending jaws of Hieronymous Bosch Villain Gods and a faceless Dictator sitting on a throne so high you can't see his face as he intones death to the individual as the human cattle are led to the slaughter. Dissolution, complete obliteration of matter and consciousness as the atoms shatter and blister.\n\n\n\n\"Red Houses\", the first track on Side B of the tape, is a surreal story about a bad acid trip. Over a simple synthesizer line, there are three overlapping layers of my voice. It was night time as I wandered through a quiet residential district. Suddenly, all of the houses to the north started glowing blue in color and all those to the south glowed red. I knew that I needed to walk south to get back home, but I feared the red houses. The blue houses to the north reminded me of my brother's eyes, and therefore seemed friendly and safe. I was tormented by this awful conflict and started screaming out my brother's name. Finally, I was so torn up with fear and dread that I got down on the ground and started banging my head on the ground, and knocked myself out. When I woke up I found myself sitting in a ditch in cold water six inches deep, with a policeman's squad car light shining in my eyes.\n\n\n\nThe broken up decayed sound at the end of the title track was caused by the batteries dying in the Fostex as I mixed the 4-track tape down to a master cassette. It sounded so weird and fucked up, and seemed to fit the theme of the song so well, that I decided to keep it.",

Noisy and chaotic, with a high energy electronic sound. \n\n\n\nTROMPEUR ET SOURNOIS\n\nSadistic experimental electronic music by Dog As Master: long passages of near-silence are punctuated by noise blasts at unpredictable intervals. One continuous 47-minute track - Imagine that you are blindfolded and naked, tied to a chair - thumbing my nose, slap in your face, a sadistic twist of your arm and nipple pinch in sound. Over and over again, no matter how much it hurts. It is the quieter parts which make the loud parts all the more painful. \n\n\n\nThese new digital masters are transcribed directly from the original 4-track cassette mixdown masters from 1985. Overall volume levels have been boosted, and high, mid, and low frequencies have been enhanced for maximum possible sound destruction.\n\n\n\n\n\n----------\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Body was the third cassette tape release of Hal McGee's solo project Dog As Master.

McGee's answer to the high concept of creating a connection with serial electronic music.\" \n\n\n\nA black body is an object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls onto it.

Industrial gothic minimal synth avant neo-primitivism. Most of the songs consist of abstract and expressionist poetic texts recited with a sparse instrumental backing of Casio MT-11 and VL-Tone keyboards, clarinet, Boss Dr. Rhythm DR-55 drum machine. Recorded at 821 N. Pennsylvania Street, Apt. #22, Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1982. Originally released by Mirth and Merriment Productions, on cassette in 1983, C59 . Re-released by Harsh Reality Music in 1990. \n\n\n\nfrom the January 1985 Cause And Effect catalog: \n\nThis first release by America's premier psychotic weirdo duo was described by Objekt magazine as \"Music for the insane asylum/ lobotomy ward\". 60 minutes of dreary, croaky voices chanting and spewing out disjointed texts about isolation, alienation and mental disease -- everybody's favorite subjects. Excruciating minimalism, great for quaalude parties.\" \n\n\n\nThe equipment Debbie Jaffe and I used was primitive, but was a step up from 60 MINUTES OF LAUGHTER. Along with the tiny toy-like Casio VL-Tone, we had a new Casio MT-11 polyphonic keyboard. We had recently bought a Boss Dr. Rhythm DR-55 drum machine, just like the one our friends Rick Karcasheff and David Mattingly used in their band Gabble Ratchet. Deb played clarinet on a couple tracks. We performed most of the vocals using our Shure vocal microphone through my guitar amplifier. We used the amp for the keyboards too. All of the pieces on IN A FOREIGN FILM were recorded with an Audio Technica stereo microphone directly into our Pioneer CT-F750 cassette deck, which had stereo mike inputs on the front. \n\n\n\nIt was an odd time. Deb and I were living in a hole-in-the-wall $130-per-month apartment in a crappy old building in downtown Indianapolis across the street from the Public Library. We lived there from the Summer of 1982 through early 1984. Apartment Number 22 at 821 North Pennsylvania Avenue was dinky, essentially one room. We prepared our meals in a tiny kitchen which had a gas oven which was always on the verge of blowing up. The bathroom area had one of those old-time footed bathtubs. The plaster and wallpaper were flaking and peeling off the walls. The apartment was hot in the Summer because there was no air conditioning. In the Winter we got heat from an ancient rickety steam heat radiator. We could not afford a telephone, so we went across the street to the Library to use the pay phones. The apartment was overrun with mice and cockroaches. \n\n\n\nDowntown Indianapolis was a depressing place to live. There were a lot of direfully poor people living in rundown buildings that had once been luxury accomodations before all the wealthy people abandoned them and moved out to the suburbs on the north side of town. There were hundreds of homeless people living in alleys and condemned buildings, foraging for scraps of food in garbage dumpsters and trash cans in fast food restaurants. Within a few blocks of our apartment were several mammoth, gray, icy-looking war memorials made of huge blocks of Indiana limestone. \n\n\n\nWinters in Indiana can be bitterly cold, with harsh winds that can drive the wind chill temperature as low as 70 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Sometimes we almost literally did not see the sun for six months at a time, as gray clouds blanketed the sky from October through March. It is little wonder that I sank into bottomless pits of lethargy and hopeless depression for months on end. \n\n\n\nI was unemployed a lot of the time. I resorted to temporary jobs and collecting discarded cans for money. Deb had spotty employment, but at least she could type, so she got odd jobs at various offices downtown. We were on the U.S. Department of Agriculture food stamp program for about a year. \n\nI had a lot of emotional problems. A couple of years before, in about 1980, I had been diagnosed as schizo affective schizophrenic. I was told that this condition was caused by a chemical imbalance in my brain and that this might very well be hereditary. I was in psychiatric counseling and took prescription medications (Lithium, Stelazine and Activan) that were intended to derail the psychological rollercoaster I was on: from stratospheric emotional highs to the depths of suicidal despair. They did the job so well that I felt like my consciousness was in a box. Instead of calming me down this had the effect of making me more anxious, because I felt like my mind was in a prison. \n\n\n\nDebbie and I were broke and depressed and both more than a little crazy. But there will never be another time like it. Our intuitive collaborative powers were at an all-time high (a truly invigorating, joyful, creative feeling!). We knew each other so well that we could complete each other's sentences. \n\nThe bed, floor and chairs were littered with hundreds of books, tapes and scraps of paper on which we had written poems, tracts, manifestoes. The words poured out of us as we tried to make sense of our lives and the struggle of existence. \n\n\n\nRick Karcasheff had made dozens of tape copies for us of intriguing recordings by underground audio artists from all over Europe, Japan, Canada and the U.S. It was around this time that we first learned that there was a worldwide network of people who made recordings in their homes of their own electronic and experimental music. This was an exciting time because we were finding out all about the hometaper scene. IN A FOREIGN FILM by Viscera was the first tape we did that we sent out and traded with other audio artists. \n\n\n\nDeb and I set about making our own unique and very personal audio statements. One of us would choose a poem or other scrap of writing by one or the other of us that we found lying about or in a notebook; the other would search for a sound setting on one of the Casio keyboards or a simple pattern on the drum machine. Then, with little or no preparation or advance planning we would turn on the tape recorder and let it flow out of us! We filled up several cassettes with these spontaneously created sound works. In a way they were like miniature audio theatrical pieces. \n\n\n\nWe chose to use the name Viscera because we wanted to create works that were as direct and straightforward and from the gut as possible. We strived to scrape away artifice, to get to the root, the core, the essence of existence, to baldly express our personal sense of the politics of experience. What did it mean to exist? \n\n\n\nI had the sense that existence itself was suffering. I also believed that each person must find his own personal vision and meaning (if any) of life. We both believed in the power of art to redeem life of its seeming meaninglessness: all the boredom, confusion, contradictions and pointlessness of existence. If life was hell and if absorption in self was hell, then Viscera presented windows into that hell! \n\n\n\nYes, it is true that I had read a lot of existentialist literature: all the Dostoevsky (Crime And Punishment, The Idiot, The Brothers Karamazov), Camus (The Stranger, The Fall, The Plague) and Kafka (The Castle and The Trial). Samuel Beckett's bleak vision of a meaningless world in Waiting For Godot had made a big impression on me. The dystopian visions of William Burroughs had convinced me that reality itself was a vast conspiracy of cosmic proportions. I could not get enough of Ingmar Bergman's films (Cries And Whispers and Persona were my favorites). At this time I favored music that presented a morbid, pessimistic view of life (Joy Division and early New Order, as well as Throbbing Gristle, Cabaret Voltaire and a little Nico). \n\n\n\nexpression of psychological/emotional states \n\n---info actually intended to be conveyed \n\nexistence as struggle/is suffering \n\nredemption through art \n\nabsorption in the hell of self \n\nexistentialism Camus nausea ennui \n\nDostoevsky Kafka \n\nmind/body dichotomy -- escape from body Castaneda/Burroughs \n\nJoy Division/New Order/Throbbing Gristle \n\ninappropriate (or deadened) emotional responses \n\n\"profoundly amateurish\" -- imperfections = genuineness \n\n---Syd Barrett, Wild Man Fisher \n\nBergman Persona \n\ndisillusionment -- societal expectations \n\ntheme of black and white \n\n\n\nAnd, in early 1983 we got Kent Hotchkiss's Aeon Distribution Service to carry it! -- wow! -- what a coup! -- now we were in the Aeon catalog along with people like Nurse With Wound, Whitehouse, Borbetomagus, Human Flesh, Nocturnal Emissions, Legendary Pink Dots, D.D.A.A., P16.D4, Pascal Comelade, Mnemonists, Lt. Murnau, Maurizio Bianchi, etc. We felt like we had really arrived! \n\n\n\nThe album We Buy A Hammer For Daddy by The Lemon Kittens (United Dairies label) had an enormous influence on our style. \n\n\n\nIN A FOREIGN FILM may be a difficult listen for many people. The singing/vocalizing is often out of tune, and the instrument-playing is riddled with imperfections. But the tape captures well a time in my life and experiences that I can never forget. The faults and imperfections reveal much about what we tried to express, our doubts, our isolation and alienation, our vulnerability. \n\n\n\nOriginally released by Mirth And Merriment Productions.

The imbalance of this chemical affects the way a person's brain reacts to stimuli--which explains why a person with schizophrenia may be overwhelmed by sensory information (loud music or bright lights) which other people can easily handle. This problem in processing different sounds, sights, smells and tastes can also lead to hallucinations or delusions.",

It was the fourth issue of a small press magazine Debbie published called 12 Seconds Of Laughter.\n\n\n\nI met Jaffe in August of 1981 while I was working as a prep cook at a Mexican restaurant in Indianapolis. We found that we shared a lot of the same interests in music, art and literature and Debbie and I became best friends. We often visited her friends Rick Karcasheff and David Mattingly, who knew a lot about weird avant garde music. They had a group called Gabble Ratchet and they played analog synthesizers, with Jack Sexson on guitar, and recorded their noisy experimental music on cassette tapes.\n\n\n\nDebbie published a small press magazine called 12 Seconds Of Laughter, the subject of which was “the obscure, in all forms”. She took photos from foreign film catalogues, nonsense absurdist phonetic poems, cut-outs from advertisements, tracts, etc. and collaged them together to make non-statements about “love, sex, politics, psychology, religion”.\n\n\n\nAfter publishing three print issues she conceived of an audio version on cassette. 60 Minutes Of Laughter was a compilation of audio routines of material by ourselves and our friends that Debbie and I had recorded on a small portable “shoebox” cassette recorder during 1981 and 1982. Deb made a collage of these recordings with various segments from poetry and language instruction records, a Wurlitzer organ, domestic audio scenes, her junior high school band and sundry sonic doodles.\n\n\n\nDebbie and I recorded numerous simultaneous poems. We chose texts from a wide variety of sources -- our own poems, magazine articles, shopping lists, advertisements, The Bible, etc. The often arbitrarily-chosen texts clashed, collided and melted into one another.\n\n\n\nDebbie and I read in the newspaper that a local Country & Western Music bar called The Sanctuary had an open microphone night every Wednesday. Anybody could go into the little performance area and play a song. We constructed big paper cones to put on our heads. We chose Dada names for ourselves: I was Jolifanto Karawane. Debbie was named Mipoola Palinga. We wrote our new names on the hats. I taped the words of Hugo Ball’s Dada abstract phonetic poem “Elefanten-karawane” (1916) onto my beat-up $70 acoustic guitar. We both donned long black coats. When it was our turn we donned our big tall cardboard cone-hats and walked to the stage. Deb went to the microphone on a stand stage right. I sat down in a chair in front of a boom mike lowered to my mouth level. I spoke into the microphone, addressing the audience:\n\n“The first step is to realize you’re asleep.I mean, would it really matter if you stuck your head in a Waring blender?”\n\nI began to rub and scrape a grooved stick against the guitar strings, pulling the stick back and forth roughly over the strings and striking the body of the guitar with my hands and the stick. I increased the speed of the rubbing and striking and abrasive scraping up to a big crescendo. I cried out in a loud voice inflected with a pseudo-Caribbean-tribal wail, stretching the phrasing out and down and around as far as I could: \"Gadji beri bimba!\"\n\nDebbie took up the response in a long cascade of wails, yelps and pseudo-operatics. Our vocal lines crashed into silence.\n\nThen I took up the next call: \"Glandridi lauli lonni cadori...\"\n\nWe continued this call and response of a line from Ball’s poem with Debbie providing the elements of contrast, background and setting. Debbie warbled and chirped and giggled like a maniac and screamed and bellowed out and swooped in big arcs up and down. I leaned into the microphone, coughed up the words, rolled and gargled them around in my mouth and throat and spitted and barked them out – going through a rapid-fire catalog of exaggerated phrasings, monkey chattering, accents and character voices from Monty Python and bad jungle movies.\n\nThe audience soon started to make lots of noise, with lots of loud talking and people standing up, shouting and yelling and shaking their hands and gesticulating. People yelled out their responses to what we were doing, things like: Devo!\n\nWe were up there making a bunch of racket, just yelling a bunch of stuff, and me beating and misusing and abusing my guitar. After several minutes of this chaos we brought the assault to a close and the audience burst out yelling and clapping and shouting – united together in their response to us. As we finished a guy in the audience yelled out “Heil Hitler!”. And the rest of the audience burst out cheering and laughing in agreement at the sentiment. They were clearly excited and everybody was having a good time.\n\nWe were scared and decided it would be a good idea to pack our stuff and head out the door as quickly as possible before we were attacked. Neither of us wanted to get beaten up and we didn’t think it was unlikely if we hung around much longer.\n\n\n\nDebbie knew a guitar player who idolized Tom Petty. Deb and I tried to work out some songs, with Deb and I doing some vocals along with Roger’s hot electric playing. “Airplanes And Engines” was extracted from an epic nine-minute version. I had written a poem of several pages treating the subject of how technology, in spite of its drawbacks, will be the instrument through which we will transcend earthly, bodily limitations and enter into different realms of the spirit or consciousness. I do my very worst imitation of Jim Morrison. “Floatin’ On The Waves” was another example of how Deb and I banalized and deconstructed rock music. The excerpt here shows us reducing song lyrics to mere arbitrary sounds, with no regard to content – only to the way the words sounded together.\n\n\n\nA couple of times that fall of 1981 we visited a waitress I knew from the restaurant where I worked. We all had a lot of fun sitting around in her house doing trio vocal improvisations – stream of consciousness – start with no preconceived idea – listen to the others – make sounds in reaction to what you hear – whatever came into our heads. Deb and I were trying to cultivate a kind of artistic infantilism, to draw closer to true uninhibited expression. We experimented quite a lot with babbling, shouting, crying, screaming, whining and giggling. We also cultivated artistic “primitiveness” in an effort to communicate as directly and instinctively as possible.\n\n\n\n“Ant War” is a recording of me playing my cheap electric guitar through a small amplifier. I liked to misuse, abuse and overuse the tremolo and reverb effects on the amp. I was trying to create something that had a lot of energy but that evoked visual imagery. A driving rhythmic pulse, with noise in overlapping, frothing currents of distortion and crackling electricity, controlled feedback and pitch manipulation.\n\n\n\n“Composition” was composed with a Casio VL-Tone, and is an early example of my use of programmed music. The VL-Tone was the first keyboard ever made by Casio. The VL-Tone was a hybrid calculator/musical instrument.\n\n\n\nThere are two recordings of Rick Karcasheff and David Mattingly’s experimental music group Gabble Ratchet on 60 Minutes Of Laughter. Both date from the months before I met Debbie, Summer 1981. I admired Gabble Ratchet’s improvisational style, and their use of Korg MS-10 analog synthesizers.\n\n\n\n“Improv” is a short snippet from a much longer jam. Debbie included it here to showcase her weird stifled scream. “Collage/Gertrude Stein” is composed of a collage of pop music, news programs, TV ads and other sonic detritus, mixed completely into the left channel; and in the other speaker, a Gabble Ratchet jam tape with Deb doing readings from a book by Gertrude Stein.\n\n\n\nRick’s two short tracks are original works that clearly point to an infatuation many of us had at that time with The Residents. “Three Blind Pigs” is based on a traditional nursery rhyme I knew well from childhood, but in the original it was three blind mice. In Residential Rick’s world the mice become pigs.\n\n\n\nOn 60 Minutes Of Laughter Debbie Jaffe included several audio scenes and oblique references to her life that illustrated some of the themes that she would later develop in Viscera and Master/Slave Relationship. Debbie’s early life experiences caused her to doubt and rebel against common notions of romance, marriage, family, religion and popular taste.\n\nThe pieces “Husband And Wife Scenario” and “New Eyes” were from a recording Deb made of her much older half-brother Jim, his ex-wife Val talking with their church minister in 1973 in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\n\n\n“Kurtz Kapers” was taken from a recording Jaffe made of her junior high school band in 1976. She played clarinet in the band.\n\n\n\nWhen Debbie lived in Marion, Indiana she went to the Wurlitzer Electric Organ shop downtown and played the organs, which were available for rent on an hourly basis. There were cassette recorders built into the organs. Debbie took extracts from her hours of organ jam tapes for the “Wurlitzer Intermission” segments on 60 Minutes Of Laughter.\n\n\n\nDeb got the sound effects, language and poetry records from the main branch of the Indianapolis Public Library. One of her great finds was the Gertrude Stein record that had a scratch on it that caused the phrase “sometimes Vollard mumbled” to repeat over and over. Debbie used this recording as a segue into the first Viscera piece on the 60 Minutes Of Laughter tape.\n\n\n\n60 Minutes Of Laughter contains the earliest recordings by Viscera, from the Summer of 1982. That Summer Deb and I started developing some pieces in which I would recite, sing or act out poems and stories we’d both written, and Deb would compose a minimalist background/ backdrop or mood setting using simple instrumentation – mostly our Casio VL-Tone mini keyboard. We wanted to get right to the heart and guts of the matter of life and existence: to live and show the pain and torment of existence through the art. There was no redemption in life except for the artistic expression of our experiences. This expression must be direct and bare, devoid of artifice and rationalization, all the loose psychic wires hanging loose and going every which way. Erratic mood swings and spurts of energy followed by lassitude...our fragmented perplexed perception of the world outside and our fragile mental states.\n\n\n\nMusic we were listening to during that time included: Patti Smith, Talking Heads, The Residents, The Doors, Eno, Joy Division, New Order, Lemon Kittens, Nurse With Wound, Throbbing Gristle. Plus, we were reading lots of books on dada and stuff by William Burroughs.\n\n\n\nOriginally released by Mirth And Merriment Productions. Reissued by Zidsick.",
