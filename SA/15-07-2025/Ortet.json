      "about": "27 Figments for Small Ensemble is a series of micro-compositions that explore texture, tonality, and timbre through varying combinations of musicians and instrumentation. Each Figment captures a distinct mood or phonic quality, creating a mosaic of fleeting sonic impressions. This invites the listener to engage with the space between the notes, where silence and resonance become as essential as sound itself. The images are sounds visualized through a cymatic process. We listened to each Figment not only with our ears but with equations as well. We mapped their dominant frequencies through spectral analysis, then transformed those sounds into shapes, etching invisible music onto an imagined Chladni plate. What emerged are the delicate scars of resonance: dark fields where the plate would have trembled most and pale filaments tracing the stillness between. In the physical world, this would be done with grains of sand dancing on metal to the push and pull of sound. Here, it’s a synthesis born of Chladni’s laws and the spectral fingerprints left by each Figment.",

This music depends upon people who can come together to share in a tradition rooted in selflessness. A playing session is all about listening, generosity, open communication, and the celebration of togetherness. Few things in life are more merry, jolly, and bright.\n\n\n\nRecorded 1, 8, and 15 December 2024 at Urban Deer HQ.",
