My father worked at a factory that, among other things, used to manufacture rock salt, and as a kid I used to love to climb the mountains which sometimes nearly reached up to the roof, maybe 30-40 feet high. The factory is now closed and this is what's left of the hut.",

Sometimes the squealing can get quite intense. I'd always hoped to find a blank tape with a really compelling hiss that also struggled and squealed as such so that I could mic the tape deck as it struggled to play the tape and layer it over the sound of the tape hiss. Pretty simple. I thought this was was going to be more minimalist than it turned out to be, during the tests it was just offering the occasional lovely tone that would shift pitches which I thought offered a lovely counterpoint to the mysteriously oceanic tape hiss sighs. I was pleasantly surprised when several minutes in things were blossoming in some much busier than anticipated directions, by the end we wind up damn near in Harsh Noise territory (capital H, capital N).\n\n\n\nDisappointingly, but also beautifully, Side 2 didn't squeal at all.",

      "about": "For several months of 2020, I had a large box fan next to my bed, placed somewhat precariously on top of a toy piano. Once in a while the fan will vibrate itself into just the right position that the rods inside the toy piano will start very gently vibrating into one another. Initially it woke me up and kind of irritated me as the sound was too interesting to sleep to. Now, however, I've acclimated and lately I intentionally put the fan in the exact position that seems to make the toy piano's rods vibrate just so.\n\n\n\nThis version has been shortened for Bandcamp.

      "about": "This is Maang#103  \n\nkraag.org\n\n\n\n One of my favorite things to do the past several years is to simply get a record skipping and then improvise along with the skip, letting whatever wants to come out of my mouth come out of my mouth. I don't pick any themes or subjects beforehand, I just go. There's nearly never a second take. To be honest, most of the time the results range from wretched to mediocre at best, but every once in a while, I'll do one that I actually rather enjoy. The first 9 tracks on this collection, clean houses exude fear, are examples of ones that I thought came out alright.",
      "credits": "released August 10, 2018\n            \n            I can't honestly recall where a single one of these samples came from. I have reason to believe \"Like Snakes\" may have been built around a skipping Steely Dan record, but I'm not at all sure of that. I suppose I ought to keep better track of this stuff, eh?\n\n\n\nThis was recorded entirely in Portland, Maine, USA throughout 2014 and 2015 and then finally nostalgically edited and assembled in the summer of 2018.",

      "about": "On Election Night I was cloistered away in the studio, as I am every Tuesday night when I'm not on tour, producing my weekly radio show \"Rssd Uul Maang\" for WMPG. By the time I'd started recording in the late evening the election was already starting to look bleak. By the time I was mixing the final results live on the radio the result was a largely foregone conclusion. When I went to do the 12am voice break I was so upset I could barely speak.\n\n_\n\n-\n\naaaaaaand that is the context in which this mix was born. No voice here, just the hums from speakers, florescent lights, and tape decks playing nothing with shards of plastic, a book shelf, several tape loops, a couple of computers, a sampler, a radio, a doorbell and a lot of anger, and flippancy.\n\n_\n\n-\n\nSo, here ya go. I made it a free/pay what you want download. Take it.\n\n_\n\n-\n\nIt's a rejection, like shooting a rubber band at a passing aircraft carrier maybe, but a rejection nonetheless. Here's to many, many more.",

The occasional faux piano notes sound at seemingly random pitches and dynamics, usually with a fair amount of space in between. It seems to be struggling to stay on, the LED blinks and flashes the whole time and notes often abruptly cut out as it resets itself. It's been my favorite thing to listen to this week.\n\n\n\nSo, naturally, between about 2:30 and 3:30 that morning I took this keyboard down back of my place by the river, turned it on and left it to play along with the frogs, mosquitoes, mysterious mammals, insects and passing cars.",

With nowhere to go, I simply pulled over and made this recording in the car as the snow slowly built up on the windows, gradually fading out the flashing of the police, ambulance, and fire truck lights on the hill.\n\n\n\nThis recording was released as a split cassette (with Kommisar Hjuler und Frau) on Faux Pas recordings in 2010",
