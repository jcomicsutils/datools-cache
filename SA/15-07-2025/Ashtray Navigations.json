The curiously titled The Apotheosis of VaVaVoom is one of Phil Todd & Melanie O’Dubhshlaine’s most direct and rocking packages, with mucho ripping lead guitar action backed by some absolutely fun bubbling synth and drum grooves. “Irons Three/The Apotheosis of VaVaVoom” kicks off with wicked wah’d out leads, followed by the subdued ambience of “Tasteful Grey Putting” and “Appropros Tower” and a segue into the driving “Hinges on the Clapometer.” Side 2’s opening combo of “Slush Puppy Window” and “Avatar Down The Highway” sounds like a head on collision between Terje Rypdal and Tangerine Dream on a dark bender, with laser guitar over a bed of tumbling electronics and tiny noises. The closing “Crack Another Bloodcapsule” is one of Ashtray Nav’s all time best, like a lost krautrock classic jam with a driving rhythm from guest drummer Alex Neilson and Sax from Valerio Cosi.",

      "about": "New album released as CD only by Fourth Dimension Records\n\nedition of 300\n\n(no digital or streaming...yet...watch this space)\n\n\n\n“Phil Todd’s existence as Ashtray Navigations began in the mid-1990s. Since then, it has been everything from a fully fledged group to a solo endeavour that’s embraced ur-drone-orientated noise, sprawling psychedelia, crude electronics and the more lysergic realms of the avant-garde. Amongst many other things.\n\n\n\nOn ‘One From Then Another’, however, we are presented with two lengthy pieces (the first of which is broken into two sections and clocks up almost 30 minutes in total) that trawl through not only the most troubled and darkest psychedelic waters oozing from a subterranean space, but also the interstellar jazz-fusion of prime Herbie Hancock. To state that both pieces take the listener on a journey would make for a cliche best avoided, but this is precisely what they do.\n\n\n\nFourth Dimension Records is proud to see this addition to Phil Todd’s prolific output appear on a roster already heavily peppered with genuine misfits, outsiders and the kind of folk who defy lazy pigeonholing\"\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n\n1: Drink the Moment/Thin Fox Legs (28:30)\n\n2. Return of the Sun of DR. Artur (19:40)\n\n\n\nYouTube:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9xmDRw9I2o",

And there is no cover, just a PVC bag so it matches the Red Culture reissue.\n\nOne side featuring a thick dinner of swirling tambouras, electric sitars and synths blasting out of tiny battery amp speakers wrapped in buzzing tinfoil (a description of the methodology here and not just the sound!). \n\nOne side of clubfooted samba rhythms and twin guitar sustain overload which offers a key as to why Ashtray Navigations' set at Thurston's ATP a few years ago was likened to \"Santana\" in certain circles. Ashtray at its heaviest and most monolithic, though those words are often apply, I guess.",

Also, the vintage 1960s \"Top Gear\" fuzz pedal which appeared on only the very earliest Ashtray Navigations recordings has been fixed so you can hear it snarl once more. A more reflective, melodic Ashtray Navigations than you usually get with this one.",

Pretty much every musical element I dig is there, distilled and combined. One finger piano? Check. Expansively tangerine wob-wob synths? Check. Red-hot tropical guitar? Check. And so on. It’s all great but ‘Outside Air’ is my favourite track. Imagine Phil and Mel soundtracking the adventures of an interstellar Buddha, preaching the eternal truths to bewildered alien races on Chris Foss style space-arks. Or, if you like, it is Ashtray’s ‘Within You Without You’.\" Rob Hayler, \n\nradiofreemidwich.wordpress.com\n\n\n\n Physical CDr NOW SOLD OUT",

And this is quite definitely the last in the \"painted clamshells\" series of CDRs (this time they are mostly yellow, fact fans).\n\nSort of a response to a review which described Ash Nav as \"obviously Heldon-influenced\"...news to me, but I decided to Go For It and prove the reviewer right.\n\nBut imagine a bunch of early 70s frenchmen playing all of their psychedelic records, all of their Ocora records and all their prog/fusion at once whilst angry drum machines beamed in against their will from an alternate future blast out very mutated hip-hop beats. Apparently Mr. R.Pinhas was an attendee at a Paris Ash Nav gig and is said to have remarked \"I thought they only had pop music in England these days\". This release may prove him right also.\n\nThis is also the first Ashtray release to be almost all digitally recorded....and you'll be surprised how fucked up it sounds - gawd bless technology for giving us so many options. Our most fun-packed CDR for a while.",

      "about": "You can now download this 80+ minute double CDr in it's entirety in glorious lossless FLAC thanks to bandcamp extending our upload limit! Look out for more epic Ashtray tracks over the coming months.\n\n\n\ndouble CDR! two tracks each exceeding 40 minutes. Snakestrings (i.e. disc 1) is a trip through strings and soundboxes, Phil Todd plays esraj, kemence, electric sitar and guitars until the electronic instruments rebel and propel the whole thing into psychedelic overdrive. Hollywood Taught You To Kiss (i.e. disc 2) is based around another Todd/Crowley/Legard trio excursion. Dedicated to Sun Ra and Andy Warhol respectively. Limited to 99 numbered copies.\n\n\n\n\"More double CD-R prolificy from Phil Todd’s thermal-riding Ashtray Navigations, here combining a solo track with a great suck-in of a collective performance. Still flying the ragged flag as patrician experimentalists, ‘Snakestrings’ is coiled oiled metal – a symphony of stretch and untailored moves. There are gentle revolutions throughout, cymbals swell like accumulating metal weather and drift off like the mild removal of a brain’s rust. The super tight guitar strings play off against the song’s slide into languidity, Todd’s soloing slowly feeling its way to some alchemical codex. A step-by-step previously unsullied route to something other, Todd is Hague level criminally underrated player and improviser.\n\nEach disc runs over forty minutes, but “Hollywood Taught You to Kiss” is the further reaching trip. A slow burn of oscillations and spike-spined lulls, the trio of Todd, Phil Legard and Mel Crowley skirt the edge of instability with shirts untucked. There’s a focus with Ashtray Navigations that a lot of artists lose in improvisation, a turning of ideas that has Todd still keeping one hand on the controls. “Hollywood…” is an enormous spinning hog-wild dip into dilatory trajectories - its like watching journeying lights in the sky eyes clenched. In a case of an unavoidable, pointless and unnecessary toe-to-toe, “Snakestrings” triumphs purely on the grounds of its purer example of Phil Todd’s vision\". 9/10 -- Scott McKeating (2 July, 2008) Foxy Digitalis",

      "about": "originally released as a CDR ltd.100 in 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Phil Todd rises again as Ashtray Navigations to generate four saturated gnarls of sweet wine raga coming through the walls from the next house but one. Slippery chimes through a washing-machine shake mirror, this Ashtray disc neatly jigsaws electronics and analogue better than 99.9% of lo-fi psychedelicists. Concentric loops of pressure impel \"Blowwing\" on a spun-out course, the rain-on-wood and melancholy guitar twine holding things in the dewy strata of Earth. Phil Todd's documentarian drive is a blessing, while other artists knock out their boring shed sessions like so much ketchup splats he continues to explore the many faces of the mountain. This release is another unfailing streams of forward looking music played via his particular palette of abstracts and melody, another episode in Ashtray Navigations unmissable serial.\" \n\n\n\n 9/10 -- Scott McKeating (15 October, 2008) Digitalis Industries",
