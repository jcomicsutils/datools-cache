Gratitude to Fujui Wang & Anes Kuo for being supportive and releasing this cassette in 1995.\n\n\n\nRecorded straight into a DAT recorder without any overdubs or backing tracks.\n\n\n\nSound source is a contact mic that was grind onto a pile of sand going through an assortment of effects and distortions. After recording I noticed my hand was bloody from rubbing the sand into the microphone. Hence the title.",

      "about": "On June 30th, 2025, I went to a gigantic concrete bunker that was utilized in WW2 to spy on any approaching enemies coming from the Pacific Ocean. Since then these bunkers have been empty and one room in particular is rather huge with enormous reverberation acoustics. So I entered without any particular musical or noise plan. I brought a small bluetooth speaker and placed it in the middle of this large cavernous room (approximately 50ft by 50ft wide in size). I took out my iPhone and found an old app I forgot about. Sort of a kids app called \"Bebot\". It has a cute robot on it that sings while sine waves play. I played this app while I walked around the room in the dark for about 45 minutes. It just simply sounded great and I enjoyed the silliness of the moment. Such a dire dark gloomy concrete room that is rotting away from its stupid WW2 history and here I am playing a kids’ synth app on my small iphone through a crappy bluetooth speaker. As I walked around the room in the dark I stepped on sticks and broken glass. Big waves tossed in the nearby ocean outside this bunker and the sound rumbled through the concrete rooms. Also audible are the cracking bones in my ankles, worn out from decades of skateboarding. After a long time walking around I forgot about....time! So I stopped my portable recorder after a while and I realized I forgot my headphones so I had no idea how this recording came out. I drove home that night and checked it out and was surprised how it sounded. It took on a life of its own so immediately I took the raw recording and sent it to get mastered that same evening.\n\n\n\nNone of this was planned or intentional but hey it happened. Part field recording and part fake church music. Not my usual style but it captures a moment in time and space. That’s my story and I’m sticking to the facts!",

      "about": "Formica Obscuripes, more commonly known as Western Thatching Ants, are very common in the Northwest of North America. While I was on Vashon Island in Washington state, I found a gigantic anthill that stood nearly 5ft tall. Thousands of ants built this hill with their relentless hard work. I took two piezo contact mics and placed them on the top of the hill with a hard left/right pan to a recorder. I hit record and captured these mighty ants crawling and scratching my microphones. I made this recording in the late afternoon and also early the next morning to capture any differences in ant activity due to the time of day, but it appeared that they worked just as hard at both times. This recording is \"as-is\" without any mastering or effects. Some EQ was involved and also some slight edits of the two different moments were made to make this recording cohesive.",
      "credits": "released July 6, 2023\n            \n            Recorded July 3 and 4th, 2023 at Vashon Island, Washington\n\n\n\nEnormous gratitude to Faith Coloccia and Aaron Turner who showed me the exact location of this amazing anthill. While recording these ants I had them listen to it live and they both responded “I could listen to this for an hour” ……… Mission accomplished!",

I have also been watching these exact same hummingbirds now grown up flying around my window while I was creating this music.",

      "about": "Deep in the gigantic forest of Mt. Hood, Oregon, is a pathway of powerful electricity. In the summer the humidity is high enough that it can be heard rather loudly. I've recorded these power lines several times in the past but this time I found myself under the towers while rain softly fell. The electrical sounds meshed perfectly with the soft rainfall. The static electricity in the air was so intense that parts of my car were vibrating when I touched them. Being electrocuted is an extreme fear of mine so I was a bit nervous being near these loud buzzing electrical towers. I had the thought that I shouldn’t return to this location because I had no idea how harmful it could be to my health, but I said to myself, just one more recording for the road. I foolishly forgot my headphones so I had to hit the record button without hearing what I was recording but it turned out well. The fog and rain falling through the forest while thousands of volts were buzzing all around me was a unique moment to cherish. I made a long composition of these electrical and rain recordings treated and processed in a way that felt like the experience of myself hanging out all alone in this “Forest of Volts”. \n\n\n\n\n\nI also included the raw untouched field recordings of my experience in all its naked electric glory.",

      "about": "\"Smoke\" was recorded while in isolation due to the intense smoke produced by the massive forest fires that ravaged Oregon throughout mid September. It was such an overwhelming experience of dread that I could not help myself and had to make my own soundtrack to this horrendous gloom. As I recorded my oscillators I stared out the window at the barely visible sun. I took a photo of this smoldering sun in which is seen here as the artwork. This recording is the manifestation of a profound and all encompassing sensory experience that assaulted my lungs and especially my sanity. While drones blasted out of my speakers my mind kept exclaiming: “Damn you Smoke! Damn you to HELL!!!!!”……. but of course the sky did not laugh back at me.",

      "about": "Daniel Menche's Glass Forest displays a glistening sound world that finely textured with the most delicate of raw organic sound and chaotic electronic noise. Not at all extreme as with Menches previous work but rather a more subtle presence can be heard here on Glass Forest. Subsonic bass drums crawling underneath a massive sheets of glass-like sound layering infinitely into a thick and dense forest of delicate noise. For fans of Daniel Menche''s ambient work and also his loud violent work, Glass Forest fits exactly right in the middle of these two polarities.",

Suspended in pools of liquid bass, layers of molten brass hover, dissolve and reappear. Pitches rise and fall, intersecting for brief periods of melodic convergence before crumbling again into heaving slabs of rumbling dissonance. Closing out the piece a low and solemn tone emerges from the roar of Menche’s spectral orchestra, seeming less like resolve, than the final flickering breath of a dying star.",

      "about": "The collaborative full length by Daniel Menche and Mamiffer. \n\n\n\nOriginal press release from Jim Haynes:\n\nThere are profound forces that enmesh the minds, bodies, and souls of these venerable artists. Mamiffer unfurls darkened hymns and sprawled abstractions authored by Faith Coloccia in partnership with Aaron Turner. Daniel Menche stands as a stalwart noise technician of many years, with his blood and sweat permeating all of his adrenaline fueled recordings and performances. Collectively, they design sound to slip between the formally defined practices of metal, noise, song, and drone, offering a phenomenological essentialism that amplifies and exaggerates the earthly elements of water, moss, soil, and fire. This can be a sonic transubstantiation of field recordings and in situ object documents from Coloccia and Turner's home on Vashon Island, Washington; and this can be the aestheticized forms of mythic poetry cast through austere melodies for guitar, piano, electronics, and plainsong chant. \n\n\n\nThe communal production took four years to develop with a few performances that spilled forth. Menche, for one, abhors the notion of collaboration, preferring to qualify this as a documentation of their friendship. \"'Collaboration\" sounds so... business like or formal or something of a technical term. We're just friends making acoustic sounds together and recording nature with our hikes together. Then we eat pizza and laugh.\" This relational intimacy and interpersonal development brings an understanding of each other's strengths, and from that understanding, the conviction to extract out the very best that each has to offer. From Menche's perspective, Coloccia projects a nearly religious capacity for harmony and melody; Turner has grace and fury in his DNA; and Menche quips about his own work: \"I’m a chainsaw artist making those touristy statues of grizzly bears but instead of wood I'm using sound.\" Ellipses of guitars and piano sparsely populate this album. Upon appearance, these forms are progressively dissolved into a dislocation of machined noise and wintry drone, abraded with the tactility of stone and iron. It can become difficult to determine where the province of negation ends (e.g. emptying the musical structure as a simulacrum of the sublime) and that of accretion begins (e.g. layer upon layer of noise, pressure, and volume to feed a collapse). In this liminal iceblink, the work of Mamiffer and Menche is resoundingly heroic, tragic, haunted, cold, and beautiful. To Menche, though, \"this is a very humble recording. When we're old and grey and come across this in a old dusty box, we'll have a warm smile. Maybe we'll play it on our death bed?!?!\"",

      "about": "\"I work at a high school library here in Portland, Oregon. Once a week there's a choir class and occasionally I will poke my head in to hear the fantastic sounds of the kids singing. The singing can be a bit rusty mainly due to the shyness factor in their young voices and the reluctant learning of the music notation from the choir teacher. I really liked hearing that rough-awkward singing from the kids and it remind me of myself being in a choir as a little kid and remembering how much I HATED IT! Mainly because I didn't understand music notation... nor did I want to and also I was incredibly shy just like these kids.\n\n\n\nWell anyways I'm always thinking of ways to get young folks to have fun with sound and such and also I had an idea to use these fine choir students for a recording utilizing their awkward singing sounds. My strategy for the kids was vowels because every kid knows vowels! A-E-I-O-U and just sing those letters as long as possible is what I will instruct the kids to do. I mentioned to the choir teacher that I will be coming in and taking ten minutes of the student’s time to record them for a recorded composition and the teacher approved with this idea but she was also very confused. How can I be a known recording musician and not know about music notation such as 'flat C or sharp D' or whatever that jargon is. I told them... \"Don't worry... kids will have fun and it'll sound fantastic.\" And so I barged into the classroom and hit record on my little recorder and began the vowel singing game with the kids. The sheer state of confusion on their young faces was rather beautiful and the singing was fantastic to my ears. I noticed immediately that they couldn’t get the low sounds very well because well… they’re kids and baritone sounds just aren’t in the picture yet for them. So I utilized a Hammond organ for the bass sounds for the final piece of music titled “HOVER”.\n\n\n\nIncluded is the raw unedited \"as is\" recording document of myself having fun with the kids and getting sounds out of them for this \"HOVER\" recording. This raw recording has a charm to it of the kids being confused and having some fun. Teenage cathartic-ism to say the least. The look on the choir teacher’s face when I had everyone screaming in different vowels was priceless. I can see her facial expression screaming at me \"Music notation blasphemy!!!\"... I respond back \"Yep, sure is and now look at all the smiles on our kids faces.\"",

An air of electronics crackles and slides around the storm recordings in a way that only can be described as acoustic-electro. Terre Paroxysm roars and cries with the organic sound only Menche can evoke.",

Two being some of the nastiest recordings I’ve heard Menche make and the other two much more mellow – if you’re idea of mellow is the creeping realisation that the world will end. What I think Menche does on the second track is explore a much more dark place than he has in the past. This isn’t so much about the blood and energy flowing through nature but more an exploration of the blacker, hidden side both in its dark recesses and its ultimate destruction. The word “desolate’ gnaws at me when I listen to Feral. Devastated, forsaken, hopeless, ravaged. The thing to listen to on Feral is the lower registers. This is where I think Menche excels. Feral One is all noise nastiness with emphasis on giants swarms of static and enveloping clouds of blackness but underneath all of that is a bass level. There is life underneath the noise but it requires some deep listening. The spooky, chalky, bone fossicking which made an appearance on his Coultis collaboration is on display in Feral Three but only lasts momentarily before what sounds like the digestive process of Cthulu takes over before changing into what sounds like a field recording of a wind, sleet and hail event in Menche’s beloved forests. Feral Four sees him bringing a lighter touch once again but somehow the creep factor delves into dark ambient territory and is one of my favourite Menche tracks period. Feral is one of the most diverse records of his catalogue. Worth tracking down.\"",

      "about": "It is easy to forget that our eyes are constantly seeing even when they are shut. We can still sense the faint traceries of blood vessels until the dark dims our view. Strange sparkles of light flicker and swim across our eyelids as they are chased by darkness. Subtle abstract films play every night, even in our deepest slumber, projected on the movie screens found inside our eyes. \"Sleeper\" is a soundtrack to these internal films. Play it loud or quiet: our eyes are always seeing. And don't forget....... Ears wide shut.",

      "about": "I was asked to create a soundtrack to the book \"D'entre les morts\" by the author Guillaume Belhomme. This was indeed a unique request and I happily responded to the request with a \"Sure! Love to!\". Although the catch was that the book was in French and I unfortunately cannot read or speak this great language. The author told me the story that it's about a man who is on a train who is eating glass and of course going insane. So with that information alone I went out and recorded trains and glass crunching under my feet along with other noises and electronic noises. I submitted the music to the author: Guillaume Belhomme hoping it would fit the book's story and he responded with enthusiasm that music made \"the story is even \"stranger\" now!\" which gave me a sense of accomplishment. Sadly..... I still have not been able to read this book that I apparently made a great soundtrack too. I gotta learn French before I expire. It's on my bucket list.\n\n\n\nThe book is published and comes with a 3\"cd of this music. It's difficult for a 3\"cd to be ripped into a computer so here it is in digital form. If you can read French I highly recommend getting this book. Link below. \n\n\n\nwww.lenkalente.com/product/d-entre-les-morts-de-guillaume-belhomme-daniel-menche",

The hotter the weather the louder the electricity is. The acoustic sounds of this loud electricity is caused by electricity reacting to the moist humidity in the air. This is known as corona discharge. I went deep in the mountains where these gigantic electrical towers come together in an intersection of great voltage intensity. No one else around for miles and no other human-made sounds except for the loud electrical crackling echoing in the mountain forest. This recording is a direct “as is” raw recording of myself walking around these electrical towers. The sound of my feet stumbling on the rocks is heard throughout along with the occasional birds and insects. No mastering or effects were used.",

      "about": "Recorded throughout the Summer and Fall of 2012.\n\n\n\nVILKÉ was created with drums, guitars, piano, noise, wolves\n\n\n\nDouble LP version originally released by SIGE Records, Spring 2013.\n\n\n\nJulian Cope Review on Head Heritage Site: All righty, then, let’s now commence the Reviews Section with a proper overview of VILKÉ, the particularly fine and sprawling new 2LP by American composer, field recordist and hiker Daniel Menche. Inspired by the wolves of his travels in the N. West and named for the Lithuanian for ‘she-wolf’, VILKÉ presents us with four side-long pieces of haunted and eerie atmosphere music whose dilating post-industrial rhythms, and seemingly ever-decaying, ever-degrading, cicadas-driven post-industrial drone-o-drudge inhabits a parallel half-world to that of the wolves whose howls the composer incorporates, nay, everywhere subsumes into his oeuvre. Elsewhere, over a carefully layered choir of wolf howls, the composer has created an orchestration of performed percussion, resounding guitar clatter and abstract piano litter. Wonderfully evocative at all times, kiddies, this is one to get your hands on. Why? Well, Herr Menche’s four splendid sides – released on Washington State’s excellent Sige Records – are each one showcased on handsome clear vinyl, and all accommodated in a luxurious housing-within-a-housing. So, whilst also available on CD, VILKÉ might well best be purchased in this vinyl configuration, each sidelong statement crucial in itself and all four endlessly repeatable.",

Dedicated to Koji Tano (1965-2005)\n\n\n\nKanticle is as it is applies, Is not a hymn or psalm but rather an 20 minute elegant sound storm of piano strikes, grinding cellos, screaming horns, clanging gongs and subsonic bass drums all combined for a lush and gorgeous piece of music that submerges the listener into a world of pure and total sound. All of the sound sources for Kanticle were created using real instruments played by Daniel Menche himself, yet layered and mangled in the manner that distinctly sets Daniel Menches music apart from the rest. Kanticle is certainly one of the most unique and composed recordings to come from Daniel Menches vast discography and is a crucial testament to the power of sound.",

      "about": "EMEGO 174\n\n\n\nIn its history throughout millennia it is fair to say the Gamelan has never had an encounter quite like this. 'Marriage of Metals' is a devastating extension of the harmonic properties found in the instruments of Indonesia.\n\nMenche was granted access to a remarkable Gamelan studio where he was given full privilege to record any and all of these rare and ancient gongs. Most notably the gigantic “Gong Ageng” that’s contains the deepest of deep of acoustic bass. Daniel Menche took the raw source material from this Gamelan gong session and launches into a heavily processed yet surprisingly sympathetic 21st Century take on this unique instrument. 'Marriage of Metals' comprises two side long works where the purity of the sound source exists amongst the entire din. Metallic rhythms bounce alongside synthetic pops swaying from reality to fantasy, from pure acoustic tonality to fuzzed out distorted clatter. A distant feedback squall is teased amongst the foreground creating a clamorous din.\n\nEqual parts curious, engaging and groundbreaking. Menche, like Philip Corner before him extends the language of the Gamelan into brave new worlds. Out of the extensive discography of Daniel Menche “Marriage of Metals” stands out as his most elegant and graceful recordings yet still staying within the grit and grime of his sonic garden.\n\nThis recording would not exist without the generosity of THE VENERABLE SHOWERS OF BEAUTY Gamelan ensemble located at Lewis and Clark College, Portland Oregon.\n\n\n\nArtwork for Marriage of Metals was created from renowned artist/musician: Faith Coloccia.",

Voraciously beastial soundwork coming from Daniel Menche. Slightly different track sequence over CD and vinyl formats due to time constraints.",

      "about": "Song of Jike is a follow up to 2002's GARDEN. This time both of us traded sounds from acoustic instruments and field recordings and traded the duties of mixing. Kiyoshi Mizutani sent me sounds of croaking frogs and Japanese children playing. While I sent Kiyoshi several recordings of cellos and other musical instrument sounds. Also noise from a old antique record player. Song of Jike is intended to be very disorientating and mysterious as if one is lost in the great village of Jike located in Yokohama, Japan. One of my favorite abstract recordings to be involved with and a homage to the style and solo work of Kiyoshi Mizutani.\n\n\n\nTrack one and three are mixed by Kiyoshi Mizutani using sounds by Daniel Menche and Kiyoshi Mizutani's\n\n\n\nTrack three is mixed by Daniel Menche mixing/manipulating sounds from Kiyoshi Mizutani",

      "about": "\"Tres Muscae Consummunt Cadaver Equi Aeque Cito Ac Leo\".\n\n\n\nWe never met each other and we barely heard of each others solo music. Just a quick and brief e-mail exchange and month later we had an incredible piece of work that stands as one of one of my most graceful and elegant recordings to ever be a part of. I allowed Andrew Liles to mix and compose because I wanted to see how my sounds and noise could be utilized in a more song/musical fashion. When I first heard this recording I almost cried it was so beautiful. Once we were strangers to each other and now friends thanks to this recording. - Daniel Menche, May 21, 2013",

      "about": "Originally release on LP by MIE Music in 2011. \n\n\n\nYaguà Ovy is the first collaboration between the sublime noise artist, Daniel Menche, and Anla Courtis, the Argentinean experimental guitarist and founder of Reynols. Based around the Argentinean mythology of the Werewolf, or \"the blue dog\" that lives on the \"Land without Evil\" of Mbya–Guarani, Yaguà Ovy shows Menche and Courtis at their commanding best, whipping up a cacophony of primal and natural noise from all manner of objects and instruments. Menche draws out the sound and resonances found lying in snow and rocks while Courtis bewitches pizza sauce cans and his guitar creating this mind flaying homage to the mythical wolf.\n\n“Menche leads the listener into a dark wilderness through shingle and stone, while around him Courtis builds a sense of menace into the story, a deep sense of foreboding, with his cracked guitar rumbling like a gathering electrical storm, an impending violent transformation. When it breaks, the downpour builds in intensity until it becomes a howl, a savage roar from an indefinable form that indeed sounds part nature, part beast, part human.” - The Liminal\n\n“an album that’s not quite noise, but not quite improv, but really has some of the best qualities of both.” - Brainwashed",

      "about": "Joe Preston and Daniel Menche's Cerberic Doxology represents a new LOW in collaborations. A new LOW in depth, a new LOW in bottom frequencies, and a new LOW in drone, noise, heavy, metal, Basso Profundo, and Gregorian Chant. Cerberic Doxology is an album of rich subtleties and dramatic textures: a dense, dark, tonal topography surveying the dizzying heights and cavernous depths of the human voice. Constructed of only sonorous and rumbling vowel sounds, its absence of consonants still resonates with layers upon layers of audible friction. A single piece statement from Joe Preston and Daniel Menche, and an epic tome carved from some form of primordial stone. This release breathes life musically and visually on three different planes of existence as a 25 minute audio recording, which is born of a vocal chant evocation from both Joe and Daniel, of which layers expand, contract, and weave within each other in an otherworldly, mysterious dronescape.\n\n\n\nThis Bandcamp release is %100 approved by Joe Preston.\n\n\n\nOriginally released by Discourage Records on LP vinyl (Still available!)  www.discouragerecords.com/label.html\n\n\n\n and also by Anthem Records on CD/DVD (Still available) \n\nanthemrecords.bandcamp.com/album/joe-preston-daniel-menche-cerberic-doxology\n\n\n\n Please support Joe Preston at his THRONES page:  thrones106mm.bandcamp.com",

Kiyoshi was the very first person I ever considered collaborating with and I have always held his work in the highest of respects. I wanted this collaboration to be as mysterious as possible so I asked him to simply give me \"high/treble sounds\" and I would create \"low/bass sounds\". That was the only strategy. I received the DAT from Kiyoshi and it was these remarkable sounds of cicadas and other insect recordings from Japan that he recorded straight to digital. I played the digital DAT straight to the mix while I played recordings from a large analog reel to reel of low bass mix of field recordings of wind and acoustic instruments. Both sources, digital and analog were mixed exactly 50/50. There was only one mix take and it was perfect. GARDEN is one of my most cherished recordings.",

      "about": "Portland, Oregon’s Daniel Menche is a sound artist whose credo is straightforward and distinct. Daniel Menche is usually known for towering infernos of densely droning layers of incinerating sound . For his new \"CONCUSSIONS\" project the sonic stakes are even taken further into a relentless world of the propulsive pulse, Powerful, poly-rhythmic percussives pound and merge together into an intense avalanche of overdriven noise blasts that actually rock hypnotically in a periodic way seldom heard before. This ain't no drum circle to be sure and fans of the recent Boredoms material or the primitive metal banging from Einsturzende Neubauten / Test Department industrial strength era will be pummeled by an accelerated experience with this opus... Daniel takes the perpetual beat engine of 49 locomotives and rides down the 2 hour tracks and stampedes off a cliff. This is the true METAL! Flex your muscles! - Asphodel Recordings",

Alas, the label somehow vanished, but luckily, this release did see the light of day.",

His name is derived from the Japanese words rai (雷, meaning ‘thunder’) and shin (神, ‘god’ or 'kami'). He is typically depicted as a demon-looking spirit beating drums to create thunder. This mythological god was the inspiration for this collaboration. Heavy use of percussion and intense electronics were utilized for this collaboration. This is one of my most favorite \"loud\" recordings I have been a part of and a real honor to work with the great and powerful KK Null.",
