      "about": "Si “Urban Sombrero” fuese un jugador de fútbol retirado, sería Antonio Alzamendi. Si fuera una especie de onomatopeya sin sentido inventada por Raúl Portal, sería Mboheio. Y, si fuera un fenómeno lamentable, sería la cantidad de marxistas que realmente creen que el kirchnerismo (¿lo qué?) es un movimiento de izquierda.\n\nEn otras palabras, “U.S.” (un homenaje a la mejor cultura del mundo, la norteamericana) es un disco que, más allá de sus méritos musicales (o falta de ellos), sirve a propósitos específicos tendientes a mejorar la vida cotidiana del escucha. A través de su cuidadoso tratamiento sonoro, estas piezas estimulan, de forma subliminal e imperceptible, ciertas zonas del cerebro que...bueno, si les digo cuáles son se perdería la sorpresa. \n\nSólo puedo decir que, desde cierto punto de vista, este cuarto disco de Cheating Spouses Caught On Tape podría ser acusado de ejercicio ilegal de la medicina.",
