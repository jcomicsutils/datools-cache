      "about": "In 2014, I was just over halfway through my time in the Botany Bay studio that I'd set up after moving from one point in Columbia to another in 2011, although at that moment in time I had no reason to think we'd ever move again. After years of developing Milieu Music and the work ethic that propelled it in my 10x10 foot Rolling Knoll studio space, Botany Bay's loft studio felt like a much more efficient place from the start. I was still one year out from starting my Deep Earth series, and I was two years into fatherhood, which had changed not only my working hours but my entire creative approach. Following fatherhood was a particularly dark night where I endured my first real panic attack, which was yet another aspect of things in my life that were changing whether I wanted them to or not, putting me on multiple paths of mending, with and without chemical involvement. \n\n\n\nSo the music recorded during this time was just as transitional and momentary as everything else surrounding it. Coppice Halifax was nearly ten years deep into my love of elementally influenced sound design, and from April to Autumn of 2014, it doubled as a barometer for my emotional state. The three albums collected here as a set are all celebrating their tenth anniversaries, and through the lens of reappraisal, thinking back to where I was, what was happening around me at that time, they are revealed to have more in common than they do not. \n\n\n\nChloroformic Forests was a triptych of sessions, released in August, but recorded earlier in the Summer, all devoted to some type of lengthy procedural process, mutating and resampling prior sessions and building new structures out of those. Listening now, I have no idea what they could be rephrasing, and I imagine that this may have been part of the point. Botany Bay, as a space, was more fully devoted to expansive and tangential setups of tape machines, mixers and FX devices, in addition to the usual growing array of synthesizers and drum machines, and unlike Rolling Knoll, which was such a small space that setups had to be broken down and reworked as needed for a given project, Botany Bay allowed these setups to flourish and develop, which led to recordings like these - surrealistic shapes of sound that emerged from pathways that were built for other purposes, revisited and recontextualized. \n\n\n\nFissured Beach, bearing the prosaic subtitle \"Before and After the Long Night,\" was recorded across two days in March of '14, with the night in between being the aforementioned introduction to the world of panic attacks, which actually landed me in the hospital when it happened. I was shaken by it, because I'd never experienced anything like that before, and it was incidental that this piece of music was able to be started and completed by what I felt were two different versions of myself. Sonically, it follows the same path as Chloroformic - droning passages of amorphous tones and chords that weave in and out of focus, while subtle drum machine rhythms and low bass pulse out a murky dub. \n\n\n\nCornucopiad was recorded in early Autumn of the year, and closes this set with perhaps the most textural and experimental of the three parts. It was also important to me at the time for having a cover photograph taken by my two-year old daughter Penelope, which I've reproduced as a cover \"faceplate\" for this 3xCD set, while the photograph on the digital cover is the view from one of two windows in the Botany Bay studio, on a June evening in 2014. \n\n\n\nAltogether, these seven tracks are an accurate look back at Coppice Halifax exactly one decade past, while also paradoxically revealing very little. Coppice Halifax has always been a seasonally affected project, composting rather than composing, building things out of impulse, temperature and reactive sensations, and back then I was doing as much as I possibly could with single live takes in the humid loft. It is, in many ways, music that could only have come from a tired mind and curious hands, in a darkened studio surrounded by woods, somewhere in the Carolinas.",

      "about": "Continuing the ongoing line of retrospective reissue sets (following the Raft and River double-album and the Travelogue Botany triptych) is Winter Botany, a look back at two elementally-inspired albums that are both celebrating their tenth anniversaries in 2024. \n\n\n\nThe first is Snow Vessel, which is essentially \"Ocean Lion in cold weather\" in a topical sense, although it also shares a number of characteristics with the Verdant Acre sessions and various moments in the Static Pharming series. It consists of three side-long (vinyl sides, that is) tracks that were all drafted live during an unexpectedly snowed-in day in February of '14. Snow was, as one might imagine, extremely uncommon in the subtropics, but it does occasionally happen, and when it does, everything shuts down, because South Carolina is completely unequipped to deal with that type of climate. So I spent the whole day in my loft studio, which remained warm whether there was snow on the ground or not, and surfed the soundwaves with my Lowrey organ on pedal bass, a couple drum machines (Korg ER-1, Boss DR-880) and a swirling mass of tape loops, synth washes and treated field recordings. \n\n\n\nThe second album offered in this set is Ice Forest, originally issued at Recycled Plastics as #31 in the Bedroom Compost series. This two-session pair came to be in November of '14, just as the temperatures began to drop again in Columbia, and they were built deliberately in what was already in 2014 considered the \"early style\" of Coppice Halifax music, which is to say extremely textural compressor abuse combined with deep bass forms and tape processing. If memory serves correctly, these two pieces were part of a wider set of sessions that eventually produced the Urceolatmospherion album, which was recorded the following year in 2015, but sat unreleased in development hell until late 2016 at ROHS. The \"Melted\" version was held off of the digital release at Recycled Plastics, available only as a CD-R exclusive track, so many people today may find this cut is new to them. \n\n\n\nBoth albums were recorded some time apart, but despite this, were meant to keep me warm on cold weather days, and they were both created using mostly the same gear in the same Botany Bay studio space. For these reasons, they've been linked in my mind's eye ever since and pairing them together on this double-album retrospective feels like completing the circle to some degree. As with all of the CH reissue sets from 2024, Winter Botany has been offered at a \"nice price\" with a limited 2xCD-R reissue set that includes the original photograph from Snow Vessel, set against textured white cardstock inserts with fresh new sticker and disc face designs.",

      "about": "2025 EDITOR'S NOTES: \n\n\n\nIt has now been a full decade since I released the two-volume \"Earthworks\" album, in September and October of the 2015 year. At the time, the albums felt like a notable high point in the Halifaxian landscape, which were very much a post-\"Verdant Acre\" work, although looking back now, with a different perspective, they feel utterly alien and distant, even a little incomprehensible to me. 2015 was the last full year of my life I would spend in South Carolina, and by the time these albums were published, although I did not yet know it, I would be relocated to Ohio less than twelve months later. When I left the deep south, I was so content with my decision, determined to never look back, ready to leave the Green Hell once and for always, so reappraising work like this, which to me feels so completely Carolinian in its dense humidity and overgrown process, feels more like rediscovering a past life, and in many ways, it really is. Before moving to Ohio, the way Coppice Halifax albums were recorded was so totally different - machines and cables sprawled all over the carpet of a stiflingly hot loft studio, the lights off, everything illuminated only by what could come through the two windows and emanate from the machines themselves - and after relocating and really having a tabula rasa to create a newer and more well-organized studio space with all of this hardware, the entire process changed, and slowly gave way to my current working methods with modular systems. And from this vantage point, now, I look back at \"Earthworks\" and feel like I am standing in field of stone ruins, wondering what structure once stood and whose hands built it, unambiguously certain that it could not have been me. \n\n\n\nORIGINAL 2015 COPY: \n\n\n\nAfter being invited to the 2015 edition of Cold Fiction's ongoing Futur[e]cho, I began a session with a few drum machines, a heap of FX boxes and a two-minute long reel-to-reel tape loop of a calmer horn refrain from Smetana's classic \"Mà Vlast (My Homeland)\". In short, a similar setup as the Verdant Acre excursions, though much different by the time I finished.\n\n\n\nIn my usual fashion of aural degradation and textural processing, I treated the tape loop heavily with all sorts of eroding and elongating, however no matter what I applied to the loop, the end result would sound beautiful. This became a challenge - overdoing the compression, smearing flange and phasing and detuned chorus everywhere, almost acting recklessly, abusing the tape and testing the strength of the foundation Smetana established in 1879. No matter what I tried, the music defiantly shined that much brighter, resilient beneath the analog loss, poignantly echoing across time the stately horns of the past. \n\n\n\nOnce I realized this fact, the sessions settled into a calm relationship of understanding and love. A soft conversation with an old friend. My choice of the name for the session, before even starting it - Redoubt - along with the source of my tape loop, came into focus as a subconscious celebration of contentment at home. I peppered the tracks with field recordings of my daughter playing with my wife and I in our verdant backyard. I imagined the redoubts in my mind not as fortresses built for military defense, but as safe havens, well worn from warm sun and embracing winds, built to stand up to the ravages of time and gravity by craftsmen long since forgotten.",

      "about": "Collected here for the tenth anniversary of the first album, \"Solus\" is now reinstated with all three iterations of the piece and no less than eighteen different variations spread across three discs of runtime, offering a massive six-disc listening experience. \n\n\n\n\"Solus\" was meant as an experimental approach to many of my different interests within Coppice Halifax in 2014, with a deep focus on textural events, by way of incidental or environmental sounds, organic contours shaped by filtering and lossy recording processes, and the deliberate introduction of different types of noise into rhythmic frameworks. The initial idea was always to create something that was predominantly a rhythmic structure - usually a kick drum or kick-drum-like pulse with or without some percussive elements - with the entirety of the tonal/melodic content of the music being mixed very far below the rhythm, burying it under the noise floor. With this, the listener would be able to play \"Solus\" in an open-air environment, preferably with the sounds of that environment present enough to fill in the spaces left in the music, with the deep backdrop of tonal sound merely meant as a coloration rather than something that would compete for the listener's attention. \n\n\n\nWhether or not anyone ever listened to \"Solus\" in this way, besides myself, I have never found out, nor does it really matter at all. Even now, I am not entirely sure that I was able to accomplish what I set out to do in these three attempts. This is almost always the mystifying reality of revisiting work from a decade past - the original intent becomes fuzzy, rewritten, and the current perspective changes how I even interact with things I've made, whether I remember making them or not. Regardless, I enjoy how obtuse many of these recordings still are today, and they align well with my \"keep techno weird\" ethos a decade later. \n\n\n\nThe eighteen subtitled mixes that appear here are, appropriately, exercises in the inverse direction of the main three pieces. That is to say, sections of \"Solus\" in all three iterations have been re-sampled, zoomed in upon microscopically and forced into more \"present\" mixes, with the noise and the subtleties now at the forefront, further transfigured by additional hardware and software processing into these orbiting planetoids that each seem to carry their own physical laws and transient logics. A fair few of them are quite heavy, and would probably feel like a woolly mammoth stomping through the club if they were ever brought to a dancefloor. \n\n\n\nWhile the \"Solus\" material has never been at the forefront of either my own creative interests or the commercial viability of my work through the listeners' views, it remains unique enough as a self-contained experiment that somewhat connects the humidity-soaked CH albums that led to it with the peripheral zones and outliers of Deep Earth sessions yet to come. By my current standards of mixing and mastering, I have a hard time thinking that much of this music would be issued in this state today, but this is also what makes it interesting to revisit, and worth preserving without attempting to \"clean it up\" for purposes it was never designed to attend. Having also been less than completely satisfied with the presentation of all six albums, in both their digital and physical editions - likely due to the inherent \"otherness\" of the music itself - I am now pleased to collect all of this music and issue it somewhat definitively in a coherent and singular state.",

      "about": "\"Mountain Interval\" is the newest Coppice Halifax full-length effort in the field of melodious and rhythmic electronic music - be that house, dub, one of dozens of variations of techno, or whatever other record-shop-bin label you'd need to use to describe it for the layman. It is music composed with computers, drum machines, synthesizers and a wide array of processors in the modular and hardware/software worlds. These nine tracks pick up directly where things like \"River Mural\" and \"Transient Logics\" have signed off, offering once again an album that, in one moment, will sound like a Halifaxian acre, and in the next, may recall another scenic overlook from a Milieu recording. \n\n\n\nIn that sense, \"Mountain Interval\" is very much about the oscillation that lies at the heart of all things - up/down, on/off, left/right, yes/no, open/closed, zero and one - and in my usual way of working, I like to further explore those oscillations in more prosaic ways - positive and negative, here to there, happy and sad, new and old, fast and slow, Summers and Winters, Autumns and Springs. The sinewave that moves time from point to point and space from hill to valley and back again. Coppice Halifax has always been an elementally driven project, named in equal halves of seven letters each for the land and the sea, which is apt here too. Leaving home, and coming back again - the transient logic that brings us to tomorrow, and allows us to reduce the present moment to something behind us. \n\n\n\nYou will find, I hope, all of those things and more in these colorful soundwaves, in music that I made initially in a stoned and impulsive environment, chasing joy and endorphin release without looking at the clock or thinking about an album, a product, a job or anything else that our current era tells us should be our focus. When I first went to bed with the fruits of that first session, these tracks were only loops of simple drums/bass/chords, a little delay trail panning them around, nothing more. I enjoyed those versions enough that I was tempted to just release them as they were, always wanting to make my contribution to the great canon of electronic minimalism alongside the masters like Modell, Hitchell, Voigt, James and so many others that have been coloring my headphones and bedrooms for many years now. \n\n\n\nBut that wouldn't have been \"Mountain Interval\" - not really. The work that sits before you now had to be excavated from under, behind and between those loops, and in some cases, when I had dug too deep beneath the foundations I laid, I had to supplement, augment and amalgamate with new structures. Somewhere in there, the usual conversations happened - what to add, what to remove, and when - and like all good dub albums, \"Interval\" passed through around a dozen different iterations, some additive, some subtractive, some simply re-colored or tinted with contrast tools, some rearranged like the modular system that bore them. \n\n\n\nAll of this is the fun part, the chasing of glimpses, the optimism of wandering across the landscape, forever curious about what lies on the other side of the hill, hopeful that it is something new, but somehow still comforted when it is not, and in between those places, a moment at the top, closer to the clouds, like the crest of a wave that can hold us for as long as we want it to, while we look further out than before, and see all the other intervals moving around us - day to night, beginning to end - realizing when we finally begin to clamber down the path ahead that they have both always been there, a perfectly symmetrical superposition, a harmony of life to a lovely tune, as Brooks Bowman once beautifully wrote in 1934. \n\n\n\nI hope you'll let me carry you through these nine colorful bends again, as I myself have worn down their footpaths as I lost myself in their tangles for the last year. At a time when life is not nearly as imitative of art as we'd like it to be, I flee into the latter, and to date, it has never failed to make up the difference that I need it to make.",

      "about": "\"Whitehope\" celebrates its tenth anniversary in 2024, prompting me to revisit it, reevaluate it and, as you can now see, reissue it. \"Whitehope\" was a very special recording at the time, something that I'd been trying to find for years, and always losing my way, ending up somewhere else, resulting in releases such as \"Narcotic Months\" and others that don't come immediately to mind. It was more than an idea, it was also a texture, a feeling, as close to a physical fabric as an imagined location could ever be, but saturated by a deep sensation that you had already been there before, that it wasn't a dream but a memory, a possible past. \n\n\n\nI chased this vision with many different machines, in different waking and drinking and sleep-deprived states, and only after giving up and moving on, resigned to the conclusion that I'd never reach this fantasia that felt so tangible to my mind's eye, did I listen back to a session during the Summer of '14 and, there surrounding me in my headphones like a cloud, was \"Whitehope.\" In all my creative meandering, from the joy of exploring sound simply for the sake of doing so, \"Whitehope\" emerged on the horizon line, and I captured it without even realizing it, feeling later a surreal sensation that the universe had played a trick on me, drugged me enough to divulge my deepest desires without being aware I was doing so. \n\n\n\nWhen it occurred to me that \"Whitehope\" was there on the tape machine, it was one of the few times in those earlier years that I felt as if the music was being found, rather than made - specific examples being the port wine-stained sessions for \"Beyond the Sea/Stars\" and the first \"Ocean Lion\" album - that it was someone else who had discovered it, and I was now merely a passenger on a trip that gave me deja vu. This feeling became more proliferated later on, as I found ways to give up more and more of my ego and conscious brain to impulses and reactive changes, navigating the sound by vibration in the dark room for Deep Earth sessions a year later, and beyond that, subtracting myself entirely from the proceedings with my ever-growing modular system, which today carries me like a cozy vessel through the same soundwaves that I must have found the shores of \"Whitehope\" within. \n\n\n\nSo, looking back on these pieces now, I don't know that I feel those sensations quite like they came upon me before. I still feel very disconnected from them, as if I am an interloper in a vibrant landscape that no one has seen in many years, or perhaps ever, and perhaps that is more than enough of a legacy for something that I had dreamt about for so long, and apparently willed to exist subconsciously. Offered here are six discs of recordings, all made from the point of the titular session onward, all exploring every curvature of the composition and growing new botanicals from the compost.\n\n\n\nThe opening track and the three-part variations following it exist in a state of superposition - both are \"Whitehope,\" even though the canonical main affair is the 60+ minute work - as the tripartite mixes manifested during the same session. Following these two albums are the four subsequent mixes of \"Whitehope\" from the \"Sublimated Ivorine Reagents\" album, along with the sole live performance of \"Whitehope\" at the Conundrum Music Hall in Columbia, South Carolina in the end of 2014, which was attended by a handful of people who probably looked on in confusion as I coaxed these sounds from a Tascam tape machine, two drum machines and some FX devices. \n\n\n\nDisc four is the \"Imperial Grey\" album, originally issued for free at my friend Matias' Temiong Recordings imprint (home of the great Ayqix), which consists of seven variations that were recorded during rehearsals for the CMH performance. Closing the set on discs five and six are the \"Winterhope\" album - two extended ambient pieces pulled directly from the cassette in the Tascam tape machine that was the core of the CMH live set, retrieved later when I found the tape after thinking it was lost. \n\n\n\nEverything is offered here as it was, with no additional mastering work or changes, as my desire to see the past as it is, rather than through the sea-sprayed glasses of nostalgia, is more important with such elemental and exploratory recordings as these. As with all of my recent reissues, \"Whitehope Compleat\" is being offered in a budget set of 6xCD-Rs in a clear plastic bag, with a \"nice price\" for both the digital and physical iterations. Whitehope, for being ten years old, sounds more like ten-thousand, hearing the tape-hiss winds and waves against the smoothed over sand and stone of the coastline. I hope it carries you as long and as far as it has carried me.",

      "about": "The second pre-album release single for/from \"Mountain Interval,\" forthcoming in mid-March (either Detroit Day or Pi Day), is \"The Mosaic Wind\" - a more danceable and vibrant work that follows the dub of \"Blue Air\" with a colorful look forward to Spring.\n\n\n\nThe title track is a bit of post-\"Watch the Head\" bass work (Korg Poly 800, Oberheim SEM/OB-X, Waldorf PPG) alongside a psychedelic landscape of modular house chords and meticulously processed drum machines like the Yamaha MR-10 and RX11. Lots of wide stereo movement, and some intricate FM sequencing through the end.\n\n\n\nThe second cut is an effervescent remix of the forthcoming album's title track by Zwei Kreise, who transfigures a palette of only Halifaxian loops into a sprawling and electric structure that recalls old favorites like Phonem or Musik Aus Strom, but retains the distinct melodic personality of his many previous mixes for me, familiar and alien all at once, with large areas of free fall between the two. \n\n\n\nA palette cleanser of beatless Roland Juno 106 through some lush Airwindows and Arturia processors follows, re-coloring the air. Then an \"Interval\" outtake that explores Oberheim machines for its bass and lead parts over upbeat dance rhythms from Roland TR-505, Korg ER-1 and 8-bit drum machines. The whole set closes with a gassed acre of vapor, a twelve-minute train line through Voigt and Dettinger shaped forestry that eventually dissipates into an early morning pointillist dew - \"In an Ink Black Sky\" was originally the closing piece for \"Mountain Interval\" before being replaced with a very different cut, but here it still pulls down the curtain perhaps more effectively following the rest of the tracks.\n\n\n\nLimited CD-R editions are available for both \"The Mosaic Wind\" and the first single \"Blue Air,\" both of them in matching white jackets with circular matte cover stickers of Holga photographs from 2008 around my old Rolling Knoll studio.",

      "about": "\"Blue Air\" is a single for/from the forthcoming Coppice Halifax album Mountain Interval, containing one LP track and four outtakes/alternative mixes as b-sides, all of which were excised from Mountain Interval for runtime limitations only. In this way, the \"Blue Air\" single isn't really a single at all, so much as a sibling to the main album being utilized in a more surface-level promotional capacity. \n\n\n\nThe music offered here happened, for the most part, incidentally. All of it, save for two tracks, stemming from a single illuminating session with my third variant of the invaluable Ornament and Crime multipurpose module in my Audioholistics modular system. This third version of Ornament differs from the first two I possess, bearing a much more powerful processor that transforms the machine from more of a voltage and clock utility into a four-channel synthesizer/drum machine/effects processing workstation, sort of like half of my beloved Yamaha QY-70, in Eurorack format. From nothing more than preliminary testing of this machine came an entirely unexpected album of work, and although I should not be surprised when this happens, twenty years into my creative process, it nonetheless always comes on like a strange lucid moment, as if I was away from my body while the work happened, and returned just in time to hear it emanating from my speakers. \n\n\n\nOnce the core idea of the album was in hand, it only needed to be finished by way of careful editing and augmentation. Overdub and arrangement sessions followed, using a wealth of virtual and physical machines that each occupy a distinct space in my studio, making the music you hear something that could only exist in the here and now of Coppice Halifax. This stands in contrast to the recent Shades of Night in Green Minor album, which mostly existed several years in the past before being brought to the surface. \"Blue Air\" and Mountain Interval are instead the shape of Coppice Halifax music today. \n\n\n\nTo be sure, many of my dearest influences from the world of rhythmic and psychedelic electronic music loom large over these pieces - Rod Modell, Stephen Hitchell, Stefan Betke, Wolfgang Voigt, Hiroshi Yoshimura, Thomas Brinkmann, Terre Thaemlitz, Erik Kowalski, Olaf Dettinger, Richard D. James, just to name a handful who all cast shadows over the way my music comes to life. Without their stellar contributions to the public consciousness, I don't really think this music would exist. Further, my friend, mentor and all-around guru David Burraston deserves individual thanking here, as it has been at his encouragement alone that I have delved into so many of these specific machines and their processes. \n\n\n\nIt is my sincere hope that \"Blue Air\" and the subsequent Mountain Interval album satisfy those who feel that Coppice Halifax has remained a bit more withdrawn over the last two years. I myself have felt that way about it, unsure of how or why it happened. I've just chalked it up to Milieu's extensive work with procedural ambient forms and the absolutely exhaustive gauntlet of making Watch the Head, but as always, it could simply be that Coppice Halifax music needed to disappear only so it could return, as Wolfgang Voigt once wisely stated.",

      "about": "Transient Logics was privately commissioned by David Hamlin in 2022, and came into existence slowly over a year of session work, with this album being not the first, or second, but third iteration of the on-paper ideas that defined it. Recorded following the exhaustive gauntlet of Milieu's Watch the Head album, Transient Logics manages to embody a sort of Halifaxian version of Head, exploring many of Head's compositional ideas (such as prolific use of odd-metered polymetric patterns) as well as its sound-palette (lots of wavetable, FM and Karplus-Strong synthesis). \n\n\n\nLike the denser and more varied compositions on Watch the Head, Transient Logics goes through several different rhythmic structures and melodic phases, which overlap with one another in different ways as the track's hour-long runtime passes by - if you listen carefully, a bassline from one section may return later in another section, unchanged, and yet utterly new when placed over a different rhythmic time division. The points of emphasis change over time too, with the first and third beats of a piece of melodic information sometimes mutating into the second and fourth beats, while many patterns forsake the \"standard\" four/eight/sixteen step conventions entirely. The rhythmic elements use a lot of heavy DJ-style processing, with high and low-pass filters being employed alongside pans and fades to allow a more hypnotic and seamless pulse, with several \"now you hear it now you don't\" moments coming and going beneath the overlapping chords, bass and lead melodic parts. \n\n\n\nEarlier in the process, Transient Logics began life as a session of Buchla 200 system ambient music, with the only remnants of this original provenance appearing in the first section of this recording. The Buchla sessions were developed fully into an album all their own during this time, and they will be released within the calendar year as the Forest Idyl four-disc album under the Milieu name. \n\n\n\nOnce the sessions that became Forest Idyl indicated that they were only a seed of what was yet to come, the first iteration of Transient Logics (and the second phase of the overall project) began to form, again as several lengthy ambient pieces, spread across a monolithic five disc span, consisting of all the melodic elements you hear within this CH recording, presented from a completely different perspective. These recordings will also see a separate release later in the year, as I feel they are more suited to Autumn than Summer, although trainspotters will note a special 2xCD-R edition of Transient Logics offered here, which contains three of these Milieu recordings on a second disc, issued ahead of the full set. \n\n\n\nAltogether, when I finally turned in the work to David Hamlin, it was ten discs of material, all bound up within this complex process. David was a gracious patron, and joined me in the last phase of the process to give these recordings a visual body. He generously gave me two photographs (which I modified in collaboration with him for the CH and Milieu versions of Transient Logics) and a relief print he created in 2023 for the Forest Idyl album cover. The photographs depict a nearly Brutalist landscape of city buildings, which David constructed from physical pieces of textile material he'd assembled in his own studio. I've tinted the photographs green and blue hues that I've swatched from the ARP Odyssey - one of my all-time favorite analog synthesizers in terms of both sound and design, which also appears on this album. \n\n\n\nTransient Logics is not the first or the last addition to the growing body of work that blurs the lines between Milieu and Coppice Halifax, a practice that was canonized with 2018's Sun Cast, although several examples of this were published prior to that moment. It is joined by albums like Pawleys Island, River Mural and Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker, even the recent Shades of Night in Green Minor, with its ability to inhabit multiple acres of my creative estate, often at the same moment. This is why, although it may be confusing for listeners, you will see a Coppice Halifax album called Transient Logics, and a Milieu album called Transient Logics. They are both the same composition, the same audio-matter and vibrational arrangement of molecules, simply experienced from two very different perspectives. Neither is the true work, both are variations. It makes me wonder how many more Transient Logics peripherally exist, further out, past the horizon line we can see from here. \n\n\n\nTransient Logics is, in this sense, a commentary on my position as an artist - surrounded by my tools, influenced constantly by the ebb of time, the change of seasons, the poison of nostalgia - I am always on my way from somewhere, and proceeding to another destination. Never able to outrun my own shadow, always instead becoming the momentary window through which I can see where I have been.",

      "about": "Throughout the almost twenty years of Coppice Halifax recordings, a number of patterns have emerged again and again, sometimes without my awareness of this happening until well after the fact. The Invisible Continent collects twelve sessions I initially recorded across all twelve months of 2021, privately released to the subscribers of the Deep Earth series as they came to pass. \n\n\n\nUsually, my preference is to keep such material exclusive to the series,where it originated, but these twelve EPs continually resurfaced in my mind, until I realized somewhere along the line that this was a coherent set of deep techno music that absolutely follows the lineage of things like Static Pharming and Astral Salons. \n\n\n\nSo it was decided to make an exception to my usual rule, and release this set as its own series, which is what you see here. I think anyone who enjoyed Static Pharming or Astral Salons will find a lot to explore here, and I encourage listeners to consider these twelve EPs as a sort of ghostly sibling to those runs. A surrealistic echo, returning years after the original signal has vanished.\n\n\n\nThe full set has been made available for a \"nice price\" of only $22 for the digital series, although individual EPs may be purchased for $5.55 each. Additionally, a very limited physical edition is on offer, with four separate discs in stickered sleeves, similar to the Leaf Cloak reissue set from earlier this year.",

      "about": "'Raft and River' collects two Coppice Halifax albums that were recorded and released in 2014 - 'Raft' (ABX30) and 'River Tableaux' (ABX31) - and reinstates them as a double-album for their shared tenth anniversaries. Both of these albums were built in the exact same way, using the same studio tools and methodology, and both came into being as a sort of 'expanded single' for compilation tracks that were originally issued at Cold Fiction. \n\n\n\nReassembled and revisited here, 'Raft and River' feel like more of a designed pair than they might not, expressing many of my interests in textured analog-driven electronic music and minimal dub music at that point in time. They feel warm and humid, very much a part of the sweltering subtropical climes they originated from, and perhaps could even be considered as supplemental works to more important 2014 sessions such as 'Whitehope' or the second leg of 'Static Pharming' that was running concurrently from month to month that year. \n\n\n\n'Raft and River' have been reinstated, but not remastered, as I am beginning to feel that my work from a decade prior has finally hit some kind of a plateau point, where I am either content to leave it as it is, as a time capsule, or I already feel the material is sufficiently mixed and mastered. Both albums have been out of print for years, and this tenth anniversary reissue aims to recirculate the recordings with newer cover photography (for the digital version) and a reduced \"nice price,\" alongside a limited 2xCD-R edition that includes both of the original photographic covers for 'Raft' and 'River Tableaux.' Gratitude is owed to James at Cold Fiction for inviting me, again and again, to contribute work to his label, and in so doing, for facilitating the creation of these albums.",

      "about": "It was 2013, and my sweltering Botany Bay loft studio was two years running, with the previous year an exhausting blur of time as I became a father for the first time. A lot of things were in a continual sense of freefall, with occasional tugs of forward motion, and having completed what I set out to do within the electronic dub/ambient techno template with the Analog Botany series and 'Pawleys Island,' there was a tangible desire to reapproach that sound and palette from within this newer and more developed studio. \n\n\n\nBy comparison, my 10x10 room at Rolling Knoll was more a guest bedroom I'd taken root in and filled with a disorganized array of hardware, instruments and label operation materials - Botany Bay represented the first time I'd moved into a space with the word \"studio\" in my mind as we worked out how many rooms were needed, and what they might be for. While it would still be a couple years before I'd amassed enough esoteric hardware to begin the Deep Earth series, Botany Bay was a distinctly different creative world to work inside, having already given me the Verdant Acre series the previous year, as well as a host of other textured deep techno excursions like 'Reflector,' 'Coastal Reveries,' my 'Dilate/Erode' split with Submersion and the hallucinogenic 'Narcotic Months.'\n\n\n\n'Leaf Cloak' was in many ways the summation of all of those recordings, informed by late nights running on fumes, at times staying up working until dawn, finding the Analog Botany sound beneath a tangle of tape crust, white noise haze and the usual crumbling overdriven compressor. If 'Pawleys Island' was Coppice Halifax combing the seaside and driving alone through rural backroads, 'Leaf Cloak' is a paean to a humid green backyard behind a studio, a totemic symbol of a new life and new paths being continually explored, having left the beach and the backroads behind for good. \n\n\n\nSo, collected here are all of the original recordings made for 'Leaf Cloak' and its orbiting moons** - the burnt out rehash of 'Chemist Cloak' and the almost industrial dub 'Night Soil' - as well as three alternate mixes plucked from the 'Sleeping Under Furs' versions-collection, and the 'Blue Cloak' revisitation album drafted earlier this year for this occasion. You will hear a distinct palette of sounds, all coalescing in a gradient that shifts between moments that are either more naturalistic and overgrown, or more machine directed and dubbed. All of it is bathed in the warm noise of my Columbia home, the inescapable permanent Summer of the subtropics, which is all very far away from me as I write this now, a decade later. \n\n\n\nFor my part in this reissue in 2023, I wanted to approach the material with a careful and conservative hand, since I've always enjoyed the mixing and the texture present on these albums, and wanted to preserve those things, while also going down the usual checklist of equalization fixes, standard cleanup work from the vantage point of a decade of doing this. It is for this reason that 'Leaf Cloak' is not being reissued as having been remastered, but rather, 'optimized' would be a good way to put it. \n\n\n\nHowever, both 'Chemist Cloak' and 'Night Soil' have benefited from a more involved mastering pass, being wild and unruly recordings made at a chaotic time in my life, when work was perhaps going out the door with a bit less scrutiny than as was my usual. 'Chemist Cloak' is the most noticeable in this regard, and it is worth noting that I could only clean these recordings up so well due to the Great Drive Crash of 2015 wiping my master session files from existence. Your mileage may vary here. \n\n\n\nIn any case, I am beyond happy to have all of these recordings unified and arranged in such an organized fashion, and I hope that this collection makes it easier to discover these recordings for newcomers who weren't with me yet in '13. Here's to another ten years of 'Leaf Cloak' in your stereo systems and headphones.\n\n\n\n**For the trainspotters and completionists, I will note here that I have omitted all of the remixes produced by other musicians, out of respect for both their work and these original pieces. Those recordings (the 'Ash Cloak' album, as well as some stray mixes on 'Night Soil') are all still available digitally in their original forms, should you wish to investigate them, but for sake of a coherent whole, they do not appear here.",

      "about": "'Sunworn' was a session recorded in Autumn of 2019, undertaken for the Adventurous Music imprint in Leipzig, for their multimedia release 'Relatives Schoensein' that paired a 92-page book of photographs by Signalstoerung with a compilation of original music. The book and compilation were issued in July of the following year, and (as of this writing) a few copies of the book are still available here:  adventurousmusic.bandcamp.com/album/relatives-schoensein\n\n\n\n The label was sent the entire eight-track session to choose the compilation track from, and what is presented here as (Mix 2.2) was mastered and released on 'Relatives Schoensein' and labeled on the release as 'Sunworn.' Until now, the full session in its original mastered form has remained unreleased, and feels apt to publish in the midst of the Summer heat three years later. 'Sunworn' is a two-hour runtime laid across two discs, and beautifully transmuted into visual compost with a new cover by the inimitable Eric Adrian Lee. \n\n\n\nMusically, the session emanated from multiple sampler devices - the Volca Sample, KP-2 and ES-1 from Korg, a Boss RC-20 looper, an Akai S2800 - alongside several analog and digital hardware synthesizers, such as Roland's SH-32, a Korg Minilogue and Monologue, and a Boss DS-330 Dr. Synth. Copious amounts of signal processing were used, such as staples like the Alesis Quadraverb, BBE Two Timer delay and Pioneer SR202W spring reverb box, but also more esoteric processors like the Soundblox Tri-Mod phaser, an Ibanez Synth-Wah and PM7 Phase Modulator. The session was recorded in eight live takes with the Peavey FX2 and Mackie ProFX8 mixers, recorded into a Tascam DP008EX and mastered in Goldwave. \n\n\n\nAlthough 'Sunworn' is already three years old, it is filled with a number of textures and sequencing ideas that I am still today exploring, such as a prolific amount of odd metered pattern work, twelve-bit sampling and deliberately lossy recording formats employed for their instability and textural uniqueness, as well as a number of spatial and feedback-oriented approaches that hopefully conjure up visions of sweltering Summer heat, teary-eyed sunshine and wavering vapors coming off the surface of the asphalt.",

      "about": "I'd originally wanted to do something to celebrate \"Milkwhite\" in 2022, for the tenth anniversary of the album, but 2022 was a big year, full of flowers that disappear, among many other things, and it just slipped past. So, for the 12th anniversary of \"Milkwhite\" instead, I am pleased to reinstate the album alongside its original expanded single/sister album \"Sno Dreem\" in a comprehensive double-disc set. Further, this 2xCD-R set follows reissues of \"Pawleys Island\" and \"River and Raft\" with a \"nice price\" of reduced cost and a lighter, more shipping-friendly packaging design, keeping the music available and affordable - two things that a lot of music is not, these days. \n\n\n\n\"Milkwhite\" has always held a special place in my mind, perhaps because it is one of those CH recordings that manages to effortlessly balance itself between the CH and Milieu melodic worlds, but also, because it was made almost entirely free of pretense. Every track presented here was recorded exclusively for the purpose of listening to while I read specific paperbacks in bed at night, as I would often have a hard time finding the right sort of music to accompany my reading, and ended up making a number of different recordings to \"score\" the material with. \n\n\n\n\"Milkwhite\" is also notable for the presence of a number of specific drum machines and synthesizers, which by the time I'd completed \"Milkwhite\" in 2012, I'd managed to build up enough of to realize albums like this one. You can hear my deep explorations of Korg's ER-1 drum synthesizer and Roland's SH-32 polysynth, as well as the Boss DR-660 and DR-880 machines I'd inherited from Obfusc and David Tagg, respectively. These units sit gracefully alongside other staples, such as the Lowrey \"Magic Genie\" organ and my Tascam four-track tape machine, and the resampled cheap Casio keyboard that was used all over \"Bedroom Carpet\" also makes quite a few appearances here too.",

      "about": "The Cmx series exists to compile and arrange volumes of Coppice Halifax remix commissions, each album paired with a rarity of some kind - a compilation track, an alternative mix, an outtake - and the series has continued in this fashion since the first volume was released in 2008. Over ten years later, the current number of volumes is fifteen, which I felt necessitated a second retrospective box set, following the first collection that combined volumes one to seven across eight discs of audio. This second collection combines volumes eight to fifteen, again across eight discs, and for the occasion, a reissue of the first box set has been arranged to coincide with this new one. \n\n\n\nAltogether, it's surreal to me, to look back and see the fruits of my labor, having worked with audio from so many fantastic producers, many of whom I had admired long before I was invited to remix their music. Of the forty-three tracks offered here, there are melodious braindance and ambient techno cuts, deep dub techno excursions, minimalistic ambient drifts and all shades of experimental electronic music. Volume ten is even a 70+ minute DJ set that was made to coincide with the tenth anniversary of Coppice Halifax itself, featuring many of my favorite remixes at that point in time. Just about every style I've explored on a CH album is represented here in some form, making the listening experience a consistent but varied one, a trip that I hope you'll enjoy taking as much as I have.",

      "about": "The fifteenth volume of Coppice Halifax remix commissions has arrived, bringing with it fifty-two minutes of analog botany across five tracks.\n\n\n\nOpening the proceedings this time is a previously unreleased cut called 'Masted Arc' that was initially recorded in 2018, and final-glossed in 2023. It originated as a jam built using the Cedar Mast samples (from the Sega Dreamcast) alongside a Korg KPR-77 drum machine from 1983, but was finished using a myriad of different devices, such as the Boss DR-110 and Yamaha MR-10 drum machines, alongside several digital synthesizers and FX boxes. \n\n\n\nFrom there, a hidden bonus track from Adrien75's 2018 'Is Still Alive' album injects a subtropical sleaze into the album, with the Beach Fuzz mix of 'Hawaiian Ring Drum Rum.' This cut recalls Halifaxian recordings like High Hawaiian Fog and Coastal Reveries, while also nodding to classic Adrien75 records like 'Coastal Acces' and the 757 LP. \n\n\n\nContinuing the tidal pull to the horizon line is the CH version of 'One Thousand Dances' from Magic Arrows' absolutely essential album Sweet Heavenly Angel of Death. I was graciously invited to remaster the expanded reissue of the album in the Summer of 2019, and Mr. Arrows preferred that I do a new mix of 'One Thousand Dances' in order to replace the original mix on the reissue. I protested at the time, as I have long felt that Angel of Death was and is a perfect album, but all the same, no one knows what they want more than the artist, and so this mix came to be. It was built, as all CH mixes are, by sampling only the source material, with no new gear or samples of my own being used, so my 'One Thousand Dances' mix offered here is quite literally just a rearranging of the Magic Arrows DNA, albeit with a bit of a Wobbly worship going on throughout.\n\n\n\nNext up, a night-time bus ride of melancholic techno, in a lovingly made version of 'Duskfriends' by Dusklark, one of my closest friends and a fantastically talented mind. There's a little bit of 85-92 in this mix, but there's also a lot of other things, and none of it would be there without the strains of almost-sadness running through Dusklark's moody movements. This mix remains a personal favorite of mine, and I'm excited to finally include it in the Cmx series here. \n\n\n\nClosing the set is the 17-minute Evaporant mix of Goran Geto's 'Atmosfera' from 2018's 'Atmosfera Jedan' album. This mix was originally released with some very different mastering, done by the late Geto himself, and I've always wanted to publish my original session because of how much more humid and warm it sounded. Here, it beautifully dovetails a set of psychedelic bedroom techno music, with lush sweeps of white noise and spattered dub textures over chordal shapes and subdued rhythms. \n\n\n\nAltogether, it's impressive to me that in addition to all of the work I've published, that there could be this many volumes alone of CH remixes, and still more not yet collected here too. With the release of XV, a second 8xCD Cmx box set is now possible, and a cumulative release collecting volumes VIII-XV will soon arrive. For now, I hope you enjoy this unexpected album made from my own work and the work of four other talented producers, as an accompaniment to the late-Spring and early-Summer weather.",

In 2020, the pandemic descended upon us, and at the same time, I began to develop a modular system for the first time, after several years of working exclusively with \"in the box\" hardware and DAWs to meet my musical needs. The introduction of both of these things into my creative approach meant that something as \"borderlands\" as Deep Earth would only get even further out, or perhaps the better term would be further down, as I dealt with the stress of the virus-infiltrated world and explored new frontiers of generative music, sound design and processing. Throughout the year, it seemed to become a balanced equation - whenever the world would impose itself upon me, my work would pull me further away from it - and so it is this sonic riptide that Deep Earth Year Five documents quite well. \n\n\n\nThe Deep Earth sessions presented here illustrate patch development and improvisation using a number of very specific machines, from Behringer's MS-1 reiteration of Roland's SH-101 monosynth (a machine I'd always dreamt of owning) to Korg's Volca Modular, my first additive synthesizer styled after the \"West coast\" sound of Don Buchla's instruments. You will hear IK Multimedia's Uno Drum, a unique drum machine that is half analog and half digital, as well as experimental techno \"grown\" out of single clicks of a 3340 VCO that's been sampled and shaped by a granular processor and other modular tools. There's also the inclusion of what could be my favorite ambient music I recorded that year, in both versions of 'Hierau' created using a multitrack tape machine and the Volca Sample. Other notable appearances are 'Veka' - my first session successfully deciphering how to make the Grass Click-Tone Control Module track pitch sequencing, which is easier said than done with a device designed for medical testing rather than studio instrumentation - and deep techno excursions like 'Ovo' which employ a minimum of equipment, such as the tuned five-voice resonator in the Alesis Quadraverb, two delay paths and a Digitech pitch shifter, to generate huge masses of alien and psychedelic sound. \n\n\n\nYear Five covers a lot of (under)ground, which is omnipresent beneath the surface of my more mainstream work, and hopefully demonstrates how and where I find many of my sound design ideas for more composed work as Milieu and Coppice Halifax. Following Year Five, Deep Earth would descend further into a meta-narrative arc with only twelve singular pieces, all rigidly composed, before entering a state of hibernation to make way for the interim Abyssal Geology series, which has continued for the last year and a half. In this way, Year Five is the last leg of Deep Earth to really resemble Deep Earth as it was conceived initially, and perhaps this is a good thing, considering just how much material has been generated by this project. \n\n\n\nThe intent was always a \"cycle\" of eight years of EARTH catalog releases, so as of this writing, two more years still remain to be explored, but the world has changed a lot since I started Deep Earth in 2015, and my work has always existed reactively beside the state of that world. Deep Earth has always been defined by curiosity and uncertainty, a willful discarding of confidence and fear of errors as I lower myself and my equipment into the abyss. What I find is what I find, and what I do not find or do not understand is down there too. Whether I am documenting the process or not, Deep Earth lies beneath the surface in waiting, occasionally splintering open to reveal an entry point such as this one you stand before now. \n\n\n\n---\n\nN.B.

      "about": "The monolithic sixth year of the Deep Earth series, finally collected here with all twelve subscription-exclusive EPs (which are functionally a darker 'alternate universe' version of the Astral Salons series). Extremely limited quantities of a dustproof ring-binder 16xCD box set are available while they last.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sixth year of the Deep Earth series unexpectedly became the last, at least at the time of this writing. Although the overall plan for the series was an eight-year run, the sixth year proved so exhausting to complete that by the end, it was decided that the series would pause, and give way to a less formalized and more exploratory sub-series called Abyssal Geology. As of this moment, Abyssal Geology is about to enter its third consecutive year, although I can also firmly state that the final two years of Deep Earth will still be recorded and released, but I simply don't yet know when. \n\n\n\nTime has always been at the center of Deep Earth, in the sense of both rhythmic time and entropic time, and as the mantra of the series states - \"Tempo Pulsos Malfokusita\" - time pulses out of focus. This observation held doubly true when I'd more or less written myself into a corner with the series. Each year of Deep Earth, whether it was made apparent or not, came with a monthly narrative text accompaniment that filled out additional contexts for the sound and the amorphous light-trail visuals. This narrative existed in eight year-long arcs that were presented in non-chronological ordering, and by the end of the eight year run, it would be apparent that they also functioned recursively. \n\n\n\nYear Six, which lies before you, is operatively the \"first\" narrative section of Deep Earth, and as such, it required a much more rigid and predetermined process of composition in order to be created - a process not unlike previous scoring jobs I'd taken on for video games or film. The narrative details a person (who may or may not resemble a fictionalized self-portrait) who is drafted into doing research for a clandestine corporation, living and working on site in a high-security lab facility to study and hopefully learn more about an artifact called the Ur Slate. The Slate is a four-sided obelisk, bearing a variant of Babylonian cuneiform on all four sides, and it was excavated from beneath the Antarctic ice after a seismic event created an anomalous magnetic field there in 1956. Things are not quite what they seem to be, and the story goes through some hopefully fascinating changes that lend a deeper weight to the very abstract music. \n\n\n\nWithout going further into the explanation and analysis of what I've assembled here, a few things bear mentioning, and are perhaps obvious. First, the entire story I'd dreamt up for Year Six was, in hindsight, analogous to my changing relationships with the machines I'd been using for years to create this series, as well as a commentary on the creative act itself. Second, the amount of time I'd invested in filling out the details of Year Six pales in comparison to many other projects I've done - from researching real-world sites and events in the Antarctic, to reading about the chemical composition of what seawater in the Precambrian age might have been, to lining up dates on a timeline with seismic events and even the technology that would have been available to exhume something from deep underground in 1956. It was fun to do, but in the end I needed a break from the whole thing, and it was hard to feel as if going back to a totally different leg of the Deep Earth narrative the following year would be anything but disappointing. \n\n\n\nSo as I sit here now, three years later to the month, listening to the music again with fresh ears, reading my attempt at weird fiction and meta-narrative (even though I continue to maintain that I am only ever moonlighting as a \"writer\" and do not wish to be taken seriously as one), Year Six is one of the most unique things I've ever done, and I've released a lot of things. It's surrealistic, both musically and textually, and I find it compelling to engage with even without all of my hyper-detailed contexts. Several of my earliest strides with modular synthesis happened in Year Six, as well as landmark recordings made in a number of wildly different approaches - everything from multiple microphone feedback setups to recording/overdubbing/pitch correcting appliances, granular sampling experiments that blur the line between diegetic sound for a film that doesn't exist and haunted field recordings - and my personal favorite composition I'd recorded throughout the '21 year on EARTH 70, which consists of only the ARP 2600. All of my influences from the classical electronic world are placed front and center on Year Six - Radigue, Lucier, Carlos, Stockhausen, Eno and many others, as well as my modern idols like Vainio, Chartier, Nakajima, Burraston and Voigt, just to list off a few easy ones - and in this way Year Six becomes one big weird love letter to synthesis itself. \n\n\n\nI hope, if you're still reading this, you'll step with me into the dark room and see what I've found. I've collected here all twelve months of Year Six's public-facing run (EARTH 61-72) and all twelve accompanying subscriber-exclusive EPs (FORJETITAJ 61-72) that provide a smaller narrative timeline (the 1956 excavation) as well as offer, in many ways, a much more experimental parallel-universe version of the Astral Salons series, which was recorded at the same time. The whole thing spans sixteen discs of work that I sincerely think stands apart from the entirety of the Coppice Halifax catalog to date. Just press play, close your eyes and remember that time pulses out of focus - see you on the other side.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nN.B. Deep Earth currently offers a yearly subscription service, which costs $83, and includes the entirety of Year Six, over 100 different subscriber-exclusive recordings, a reusable discount code for anything in the catalog (from Year One to Year Five) and of course all material released within a calendar year following your subscription.

      "about": "Happy Green Saturday, to all who celebrate. Having wandered into a weird Springtime, I am happy to offer you a pipe of four Halifaxian cultivars, some of which have been plucked from the workshop archives of over a decade past. Despite this, Shades of Night picks up directly where the CH dub of Milieu's \"Mural Hex\" left off, and this path will continue forward later in the Summer on the Transient Logics album. \n\n\n\n\"Ceremonial\" is the oldest, and opens the starry-eyed affair with far too much sub-bass, subtly microtonal synth lines and percussion shaped from fireworks on an old Akai 12-bit sampler. It was recorded almost immediately following the sessions for Leaf Cloak in 2013-2014, close enough at the time that I felt a bit regretful over not having been able to include it on that album. It cured on the shelves for years, initially being passed around to other dub techno labels, who all inevitably turned it down, likely because it isn't really dub or techno, but some liminal gradient between the two. \n\n\n\n\"In Green\" meanders in with a slower tempo and a softer approach, most resembling Dusk Versions and the precedent Analog Botany series with its sinewave bassline, cratedigger percussions and more 12-bit sampler chords. Halfway through, modernity arrives with a Poly 800 bassline and a firmer house beat, which is slowly surrounded by SEM chords and leads and even more FM synths. \n\n\n\n\"Unison\" is or was the problem child of the group, with a cozy but inoffensively boring original mix that I decided would be better served as foundational mortar for something more developed and exciting, with copious layering of new parts. So little of the original mix remains intact here that I could publish the track as a totally separate entry here, but I enjoy this fresh take so much more. It offers a melodic and colorful \"side two\" counterpoint to \"Ceremonial,\" with a more complex polymetric structure that allows danceable and hypnotic arrangements to do their work. \n\n\n\n\"Surrendered\" is the longest cut on offer, gently pulling us out into the dark waves from an empty beach. With its Galaxy Maker swoons of synthetic strings and motorik bassline, it brings me back to many different times and places through the years, many of them wistful and sweetly melancholic. By the end, the disco has sunk beneath the glistening surface of the sea, leaving only a disembodied cluster of melodies to float further out. A theme emerges, retreats, dissipates in an echo. I wave goodbye, but this is only goodbye for a while. My vessel will return later on, sunburnt and saltwater baptized, with unimagined secrets and perfumes in tow.",

      "about": "Arriving slightly delayed (laid...laid...laid...perfect for a dub album) for it's tenth anniversary celebration is CEDAR MAST, an album of minimalistic techno that was built using only samples of the Sega Dreamcast's boot menu and a Korg sampler, aided in part by samples of archaic drum machines like Mattel's Synsonics and Yamaha's MR-10.\n\n\n\nCEDAR MAST conveys a set of straightforward dry techno mixes that bubble with white noise and the watery washes of Dreamcast samples. These tracks exist on the rim of monochromaticism, echoing both the ANALOG BOTANY sessions that preceded them and the LEAF CLOAK sessions that would follow. Alongside the five original tracks, I've also included the \"Rebuild\" that opened the CEDAR MIXES collection of reworks - a non-album cut that was fashioned using only the loops and materials offered to other artists who were invited to participate. \n\n\n\nFor the second half, CEDAR MAST REDUCED mutates the material into something more experimental and Chain Reaction-inspired, which provided a precursory look at the sound of DEEP EARTH, still yet to come at the time. This second disc has been augmented with a 2022 EXCAVATION, a new nearly hour-long session of soft-focus dub, created using the same machines and samples as the original album, a decade later.\n\n\n\nThere is a surprising amount of vagueness I feel now, with regard to adding anything prosaic to the topic of CEDAR MAST. Any sentiment I could think to express is very clearly and fully articulated somewhere in the dense surrealism of the music, and what initially began as a proof-of-concept experiment with sampling and already-outdated video game consoles in mind clearly navigated itself into many different atmospheres both above and below the forests and seashores of the Halifaxian continent. CEDAR MAST resembles many different facets of my work through the years, and so it feels that much more elementally a part of my creative landscape, rather than something that might occupy it. \n\n\n\nRevisiting material from a decade ago has become, somewhat comically, a predictable exercise, although it is not without a fair share of challenges, all of which I am willing to forge a new path through in order to hopefully reinstate something in its best possible iteration, and maybe, if I'm lucky, rediscover what possessed me to do these things in the first place. CEDAR MAST is an anomalous ship in a nonlinear sea, and I've done my very best to update and maintain it in order to see it off for another ten years - perhaps when that time has passed, we will see if I have succeeded.\n\n\n\nN.B. - A very limited edition of 10 copies of the 2xCD-R reissue has been made available for the occasion, first come first serve as always. If you've missed out, and you really can't live with yourself, please get in touch in all the usual ways and I'll see what I can do.",

      "about": "The CMR Pillar Excavation is a new forty-minute session of polymetric ambient techno, courting shades of dub music and drifty generative synthesis across its runtime. It was recorded in late 2022 using only the boot sounds of the Sega Dreamcast video game system in tandem with several different hardware samplers and an array of outboard FX. It was drafted in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Cedar Mast album, and is included in an expanded and remastered edition of that release (  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/cedar-mast-expanded-remastered  ) but I've opted to give it a singular release also, separated from the reissue, in order to both allow it to exist as a new piece of cataloged music, as well as give listeners the opportunity to bypass the reissued decade-old material and simply access what's new.",

      "about": "Ten years ago in April 2013, the Leaf Cloak album was published, and both symbolically as well as aesthetically began what I now consider my post-Analog Botany phase of Coppice Halifax recordings. The album's sessions were long and varied, yielding no less than two full-length albums of original takes, a remix album and a beatless ambient companion piece, as well as numerous stray mixes that would be released piecemeal in the years to come. Somewhere in that frenzied process, I'd begun work on yet another variant of the Leaf Cloak sound, bringing together samples from all prior versions into a new set of shapes that would feel familiar, but also sit apart from the rest of the mixes. These pieces would never be finished until this year, as I approached the tenth anniversary of the Leaf Cloak album, and now they have finally arrived - a Blue Cloak, aptly named from beneath the downpours of this very rainy Spring season. \n\n\n\nBlue Cloak is three sidelong (in vinyl terms) assemblages of ambient music, analog textures and noise, dub rhythms and basslines, and a wealth of filter-warped and delay-spattered chords. It was created using elements from all six Leaf Cloak tracks, tape loops harvested from the Chemist Cloak bent-cassette dubs and even some of the hardware that was used on the original sessions, such as the Roland SH-32 synthesizer and the Korg ER-1/Boss DR-660/DR-880 drum machines. \n\n\n\nThe resultant recordings accomplish finally what I set out to do a decade ago, to make deeper and more tangential pieces of dubby atmosphere and groove that referred to Leaf Cloak in topical ways, while also using the parts and processes to create completely new sounds. In many ways, I am glad I did not finish the work I started until now, as my current fascinations with polymetric sequencing and generative synthesis have helped to inform the work in ways that would simply not have been possible all those years ago. \n\n\n\nBlue Cloak is also intended as a herald for the imminent Leaf Cloak reissue set that I hope to complete preparations for by the end of Summer. The plan is to assemble a box set that collects Leaf Cloak, Ash Cloak and Chemist Cloak alongside Blue Cloak and perhaps a fifth disc of stray mixes and other ephemera from the period. The beatless fantasist pastorale Mistmorning, a split project with close friend and frequent collaborator Zwei Kreise, will also see a reissue, which may or may not include expanded material also. For the moment, Blue Cloak felt appropriate to be issued ahead of these arrangements, for the Spring season, and simply as a proper album in its own right. \n\n\n\nHappy Spring from Coppice Halifax, and I hope you'll join me in wishing Leaf Cloak a happy tenth anniversary also!",

      "about": "Somewhat surprisingly, it has already been four and a half years since the twelfth volume in the Cmx series was issued. For one reason (or several), I've been preoccupied enough with other albums and projects that continuing this archival thread of remix collections slipped away from me. With Autumn's leafy breeze now fully within the lungs of the valley, I could not be happier to sit down and assemble another compilation of Coppice mixes, so here's what Cmx thirteen contains: \n\n\n\nOpening the album, as is the usual Cmx custom, is an original cut - the 'Rust Flex' mix of Appleblue Dram, a hardware live set from May 2018 (see:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/appleblue-dram  ) which was originally issued at Arctic Dub in Portugal on a 2019 compilation. This mix and master of the track has never been released up to now, with the Arctic Dub compilation having been mastered by the label at the time. Trainspotters will note a *lot* more low end is present in this version. \n\n\n\nNext is a ten-minute dub techno space-out I constructed for Specta Ciera (aka Drexon Field) for his superb Terrain Scan LP issued at Recycled Plastics in 2019. This mix was built using sampled sections from all over the Terrain Scan album, but primarily used melodic information from 'Star Sector' and 'Pattern Scanner', and echoes the kind of post-Analog Botany dub I was making in 18 and 19. Until now, it has only been made available as a bonus track on the Terrain Scan CD-R. \n\n\n\nAt number three, we have the inimitable Foamek, with one of two mixes I made for his totally essential On Doing/Being Ordinary companion disc, Avalon (Remixes). My 'Dripping Lawn' mix is the longest track presented here, at nearly 18 minutes, and careens through late-night coastline cruises with neon highs and shadowy lows, recontextualizing Foamek's vocal samples into a DX-like space chorus, and running a Kompakt-inspired bassline beneath the proceedings. \n\n\n\nFourth is the heaviest and most aggressive of the six tracks offered here, my 'Triadic Phaseout' of Substak's 'Index', which nearly resembles something like Bike more than a CH cut, but I'm sure I had my reasons in Summer 2018. This one was a disc-exclusive cut for the CD-R edition of Index, although it made a brief appearance on one of the Conference Call compilations at RP after the fact. Lots of polymeter that amounts to an almost drum and bass rave up, thick and angular with plenty of DSP warping and break chopping. \n\n\n\nAfter the romp of the Substak mix, it felt pertinent to pull the intensity back a bit and my remix of Arbee's 'Chaine' more than accomplishes this need. Originally issued on Polysemie III, at Unknown Tone Records in early 2020, this version of the remix is my own master, previously unreleased. Filled with warbling tape spool effects and low-bit Akai sampler sounding passages of bass and synth, this mix recalls my perennial influences from Mille Plateaux atmospherics and early Vladislav Delay records. A lovely off-grid spattering of noise and melody that dovetails the album beautifully into the spacious closer...\n\n\n\nAnd closing the set is my 'Lunar Debris' mix for Dérive Dub (aka Dimitar Dodovsky) on his Notte Variations album at Recycled Plastics, in early 2019. Like tracks #2 and 4, this mix was also a disc-exclusive bonus cut on the CD-R edition of Notte Variations, and has remained offline until now. A breezy night-time dub with elemental textures woven throughout, taking influence from all the Echospace material I was listening to almost constantly at the time, specifically Phase 90 and Variant.",

      "about": "What seems like a shorter volume of only four tracks for the fourteenth Cmx album is in fact a deceptively deep 67 minutes of ambient techno and minimal dub music. Opening with a previously unreleased mix of 'Refocus' that was shelved in the archives as a rehearsal, Cmx XIV establishes the foggy Gaussian mood that will follow throughout the duration. The second cut is a rare mix for Response=Signal, which was included only as a bonus track on the CD-R release at Recycled Plastics, and this mix meanders polymetrically through a soft haze, inspired by Dettinger and Wolfgang Voigt's M:I:5 material, among other Profan recordings. Following this is the Sunthaw mix of Parallelism's 'Ice Ghosts,' previously unreleased until now, and perfect to curl up inside while the Winter cold stays outside. Closing the set is the expansive 35-minute April Valley Nights mix of Foamek's 'Avalon' - also a disc-exclusive bonus track at Recycled Plastics - which offers a spacious and psychedelic pasture of new wave rave bass, crumbling tape loop textures and a persistent heartbeat of a waterlogged drum machine.",

The digital audio offered here has been captured from one of the dubbed tapes, and the tapes themselves may or may not still contain audible remnants of religious zealotry. A lively analog accompaniment to a nightly hash pipe and a breezy Spring-greened porch.",

      "about": "Where to begin? For myself, and many of you, the words \"Ocean Lion\" conjure up a world of sound and texture that feels distinct from many of my other recordings. The project began in the Spring of 2008, as the first two tracks on what would become the first Ocean Lion album, recorded as a birthday gift for my friend Erik, whose music remains an important influence on my own. In the time since then, I've recorded two more volumes under the heading, the second being more of a Pawleys Island-adjacent dub techno outing, and the third being a triptych of beatless ambient excursions, which is already almost seven years behind me, unbelievably. \n\n\n\nI always knew I'd return to Ocean Lion, that I envisioned it from the start as a four-volume run, inspired by the then-canon of Wolfgang Voigt's first four GAS albums, but I never could quite grasp the where and when of those visitations, with Ocean Lion material surfacing and receding like the tide itself, ignorant of my desires, blind to any time passing at all. It is with this notion in mind that Ocean Lion IV arrived - I fondly think of it less as me diving into the sea, and more that I've been pulled beneath the waves by the undertow and displaced into its permanent blue kingdoms. Several friends and listeners brought Ocean Lion into our conversations, unbeknownst to one another, and as always, the universe never fails to communicate to me what I ought to be doing, so here I am again, standing on this shore, exhausted. \n\n\n\nI've brought with me four ornate bottles this time, filled with the seduction of purple liquors retrieved from fabled shipwrecks, equal parts melancholic longing, faded memory and the sweet poison of nostalgia. These I have poured for myself across two weeks of brain-fried evenings, sitting in my studio, consumed by the stress of the modern world and my forever changing placement within it. I can no longer tell whether or not these things are for me, or if I've simply been compelled to bring them up to the surface again for some other reason yet to be discovered. Ocean Lion, as ever, simply is. \n\n\n\nLooking back at the series up to this point, it's almost unrecognizable now, with IV bearing so many different feelings and atmospheres that once again, what I think of as Ocean Lion is changing even when I cannot detect it. I found myself asking questions like \"Can a Coppice Halifax album have so many guitars?\" and \"Am I content with this being the end of this series?\" I think of Sun Cast, and things like Pawleys Island or River Mural before and after it, and realize that I have long ago made my peace with the fact that my work is one big Venn diagram that overlaps in gradient percentages with itself, that lines and boundaries change, or have been revealed to be absent to begin with. The dubby basslines from the first album have returned, covered in distorted guitar barnacles and coral shapes, while the subdued motorik rhythms have floated fully to the surface, sunburnt and waterlogged like chunks of driftwood. Like pinhole stars in an ink-black sky, notes of synthesizers and samplers have pointillistically scattered and coalesced into polymetric arrangements, ornately decorating the frothing sea like a glittering crown. \n\n\n\nBy the end, we're left with a plaintive strum on ten bronze strings, wavering across the breeze like an echo of a lost love, somewhere off the coast of the nearest strand's doomed civilization. The clouds part and the waves calm, just enough for the sad sunshine to peek through and remind us of all the wonderful things we used to know, all the curious thoughts we used to ponder, before draping an overcast shroud across us once again in this cosmic evening, weighing heavily upon us with that abyssal gravity, as we sink again beneath the tidal pull, alone and together all at once, desperate and displeased with whoever we are.\n\n\n\nBut is this the end? Artistically, it is up to me to decide, but I have to be honest with you, as I often am, and candidly admit that even I don't know. This line of work is not as obvious as others, with the linearity and completeness that so many other vocations offer. Instead I'm left with the turn of a page, and another empty new one, and sometimes the book sits there accumulating dust for years while I am off in other pursuits, while other times, I already know what I will write before I begin. For now, let's just enjoy this small golden hour together before the sun sets, and we'll say that we'd like to see each other again, even if we don't completely know that it will happen. The green hills of tomorrow are always alive with nascent unspoken wisdoms, unaware that they too will become the empty valleys of memory, so perhaps we'll find ourselves there, or perhaps we won't.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nPrevious entries in the Ocean Lion series: \n\n\n\nOcean Lion -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-lion\n\n Ocean Lion II -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-lion-ii\n\n Ocean Lion III, Part I -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-lion-iii-part-one\n\n Ocean Lion III, Part II -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-lion-iii-part-two\n\n Ocean Lion III, Part III -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/ocean-lion-iii-part-three\n\n Lioness -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/lioness\n\n Lioness II -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/lioness-ii",

      "about": "Autumn Contrast was a beatless dub session recorded in late 2019, and released at the now closed Arctic Dub label in February 2020 as part of their sixth label compilation. With the much-anticipated return of the titular season this year (my favorite of the seasons, somewhat unsurprisingly), I felt compelled to put together a release of the full session, which includes the \"composted\" mix (later issued on Filtered Artifacts III) and a previously unreleased 40-minute version - the lion-maned KMS Dub - completing the circle, giving Autumn Contrast a proper release here in the ABX catalog. \n\n\n\nSonically, the session was led by the Korg MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer, which unspooled shimmering dub chords through the standard outboard FX rig in the studio at that time (BBE Two Timer analog delay, Alesis Quadraverb, Boss SL-20 slicer and RV-3, Moogerfoogers, Digitech Whammy 4), and augmented by vintage drum machines from Korg (KPR-77) and Roland (TR-626) after they were resampled via an Akai S2800 12-bit sampler. Basslines came from a Korg Volca Sample and an Arturia Microbrute, and field recordings were incorporated via a Roberts 450A reel to reel and additional delays/flangers/etc. Trainspotters will note that the original version of Autumn Contrast is presented last in the track sequence - this decision reflects the original order the tracks were recorded in, illustrating how sometimes the piece chosen from a given session for release is the last take attempted. \n\n\n\nHappy Autumn from the White Pillar Workshop!",

      "about": "Almost exactly one year prior (to the day), REFLECTOR was given a 10th anniversary remaster and reissue, augmented by four new pieces - designated as RELICT - that transfigured the original source material in new ways, a full decade after the initial sessions. As many things in my creative landscape are, REFLECTOR was itself a branching work from an album called RADIANS, which was recorded prior to REFLECTOR but issued a year after it at Recycled Plastics - owing to a delay in record label schedules (isn't there always?) - and so in some strange sense, we're able to celebrate these albums being reinstated in an order reversed from their point of origin, and I've just got to laugh, because it has always felt more obvious that REFLECTOR became the \"canonical\" version of these compositions, rather than RADIANS, and even ten years later, I cannot divorce the material from that interpretation. \n\n\n\nSonically, RADIANS was one of the post-ANALOG BOTANY/PAWLEYS ISLAND albums that further explored the format of dub techno and psychedelic ambience, \"drone techno\" as a few people liked to refer to it at that moment in time, and looking back, I've never been 100% happy with the original mastering on the album. RADIANS was an exciting record to make, playful and filled with all manner of bubbling vocoder chords, spasms of noise and textural grit, incessant and almost motorik rhythmic forms, and to my ears now feels much more like a transitional work than a cogent through-line of any sort. I am more than pleased that I have finally managed a mastering pass on the material that feels more substantial and comfortable than it has prior to this. \n\n\n\nFollowing in the same template laid out by the REFLECTOR reissue, I've once again revisited the RADIANS source material in the form of four new RELICT sessions, although a number of notable differences followed in the resultant recordings. The most obvious change is the higher tempos present in these new tracks, along with a generally more dialed-back level of reverberation, instead favoring spatial effects like chorus, delays of various disciplines and even some granular processing, which hopefully opened up the stereo field enough to allow these nascent waters to draw new river lines across the Halifaxian map. RADIANS itself was notable at the time for containing some faster than usual tempos within the CH catalog, and so it is my desire to reflect this thinking in my re-visitation of the material.\n\n\n\nLongtime listeners will note the absence of three remixes drafted for RADIANS, by Ohrwert, Contemporary Vision and Emi Ono, and these mixes have been omitted from the reissue edition in order to maintain a more cohesive feel in the runtime between the original album and the new RELICT recordings. Those interested in obtaining these three mixes can still listen to/purchase them at Recycled Plastics. \n\n\n\nAs before, the expanded edition of RADIANS has been given a new physical reissue, with a holographic 3x3\" cover sticker to match the REFLECTOR reissue, making the two double-albums a complete mirror image of one another. Both photographs used for the REFLECTOR and RADIANS reissue editions were taken beside the outside wall of the White Pillar studio door, echoing the original design of spattered paint and textured stone given to both editions of REFLECTOR at Entropy Records in France. For the occasion, the REFLECTOR 2xCD-R has been reinstated with an additional 10 copies, so that newcomers can pick up both albums at once if they so desire:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/reflector-10th-anniversary-expanded-remaster",

      "about": "'Sinking Magenta' is an EP collecting three different shades of Halifaxian acreage, each from a different session, and designed with a different purpose in mind. \n\n\n\nThe title track was recorded in August of 2021 for inclusion on a compilation at Adventurous Music, and I've wanted to make a single or EP for it since then. The second track is an alternative mix of 'Varia' from the Porch Hash Variations sessions in April of 2021, and was given a subsequent release at Cold Fiction as part of their annual Futur[e]cho compilation later that year. The closing track - 'Mansfield Flares' - is a previously unreleased session that tangentially grew out of Milieu's Passage Five album in Autumn 2019, initially recorded as a smeared and impressionistic Ocean Lion-adjacent dub and shelved away for later reference, and then more rigorously filled out in sporadic updates since then, with this final mix illustrating a lot of polymetric composition and even some wild drum programming that you can tell was done during the sessions for The Flower to Disappear.\n\n\n\nAll three of these recordings link together through their shared nature with Milieu recordings, either in provenance or in process, and like other releases that follow this path (see: River Mural) I relish the chance to blur the lines between my projects where and when I can, because it feels as if these compositions are always moving in two different directions at once. The EP is also texturally fitting for the anticipation and colorful excitement I feel as Spring slowly emerges from the thrall of a bitter Winter, and it is always my sincere hope that my music provides an apt elemental counterpart to your experiences with the natural world.",

Perhaps, in its speechless wordless mind, it knew what was to come, and remained inert, knowing that when the world moved on, it would be found and reclaimed, migrated here like some alien jewel that transfixed the gaze of hapless travelers, so weary from all the running, so willing to lie down and rest in the black washes of sedative, emanating from this infernal artifact. \n\n\n\nThis recording comes recommended to listeners who enjoyed Verdant Acre, Slow Earth Ritual and any number of the earlier CH canon of heavy dub and surrealistic textural weather.",

      "about": "Conceived in late 2020, Astral Salons issued nine EPs and three LPs, one per month, for the entirety of 2021. The series manifested from a number of reference points - nine expired Polaroids taken during the total solar eclipse on August 21st 2017 (as well as ten Instax photos taken the same day) provided a visual stimulus, while my desire to 'return' to a serial format of ambient techno EPs, in the vein of Static Pharming, provided the thematic details. \n\n\n\nFrom there, focus was placed on a few different methods of synthesis and specific machines or effects processors that would aid in the work - samplers such as Korg's ES-1 and Volca Sample, Akai's S2800, the Boss RC-20, as well as monosynths such as the Arturia Microbrute and Korg Monologue, polysynths like the Roland SH-32 and Juno 106, Arturia's Microfreak, and FM synthesizers like the Yamaha TX81Z and the Korg Volca FM. All of these things were utilized in conjunction with a Vesta Fire MR-10B multitrack tape machine, a Tascam DP-008EX multitrack digital recorder, external FX devices like the Pioneer SR202W spring reverb, Alesis Quadraverb, PVDJ Grabber and many more effects/modulation opportunities within my growing R-EW Audioholistics modular system. Clearly, while this would be Coppice Halifax playing ambient techno music, it would be done in a way that I'd not really done it before, and that was important for a project that's been trying to find a way since 2005. \n\n\n\nMusically, things began where you may have expected them to, with bouncy rhythms and spacious chords, but there was already a seed of something a bit more out there, the \"astral\" side of the music perhaps, shaped by my interest in amplitude modulation via VCAs, gate programming and the migration of almost microtonal tape material harvested from prior sessions like Silhouettes. As the series progressed, however, it came more and more into focus, with complex polymetric composition taking the lead, as well as bolder textures of FM synth and even vocal processing emerging throughout. By the end of the final three full-length \"Tributaries\" that close the set, it was easy to see that progress had been made, a path had once again been carved out, although, as a close friend put it, it was difficult to remember where we started by the time we found ourselves at the end. \n\n\n\nI think there's something to that last sentiment, the notion that repetitive and hypnotic music, techno and psychedelic music specifically, displaces the listening mind from a state of awareness and takes it somewhere else, somewhere more vividly colored, where the feeling of the vibration provides the subconscious with environmental information, spatial awareness, temperature and so on. Not quite an out of body experience, but perhaps, an out of mind experience? I don't quite know enough about biology or physiology to comment definitively upon it, but I am certain that the Astral Salons recordings are doorways to other places, outside of time, and that anyone even somewhat familiar with Coppice Halifax recordings will find a lot to love on these twelve pieces. They've been made with joy, curiosity and playful experimentalism, and certainly have made such a distinct mark in my catalog that I am now moving forward with CH recordings that I think of as \"post-Salons\" recordings. \n\n\n\nSomething is always changing, and something else is always remaining the same, but you can never quite know which is which, can you?",

      "about": "ORIGINAL RELEASE COPY, JULY 28 2012: \n\n\n\n\"In October of 2011, the massive concept double-album Pawleys Island was issued first on an intimate edition of 20 copies on 2x cassette tape. During the creation and recording of the Pawleys songs, I realized just how much love and expression I funneled into the melodies and composition, despite the album largely being carried in a very rhythmic techno-inspired vehicle. Taking these thoughts into consideration along with the fact that the nostalgic territories Pawleys mined were just as connected to records like Selected Ambient Works II, Walter Carlos' Sonic Seasonings and early orchestral influences like Satie and Debussy, it became clear to me that there was a beautiful ambient album hiding beneath the waves of Pawleys Island. Dedicating myself to the pursuit of such a notion, I began recording this album of ambient versions of Pawleys pieces somewhere near the last 1/4 of the recording sessions for the album proper.\n\n\n\nI think it is important to note that the songs on Inland By Night are not merely beatless counterparts of PI material, rather they are entirely their own identities, memories and locations. The movements from PI will no doubt be recognizable, although they are considerably altered in pace, processing, tone and color, and both sides have been backed by an assemblage of field recordings: the exact length of a car drive from the beach in Surfside to my father's home in rural Loris, complete with the subtle sounds of tire traction on pavement, layered carefully alongside recordings of the sun rising at dawn over a humid marsh. Inland By Night is an approximated reimagining of those same Pawleys Island memories. Stoned, worn out from a long night of work or partying (or both) and driving home in the early morning hours to sleep and dream of the blissful shores I would one day tread in my creative travels. So here we are, years later, together in longing for that same happy sleep.\"\n\n\n\n10TH ANNIVERSARY, REFLECTIONS ON LAND, NOVEMBER 1 2022: \n\n\n\n'Has it really been ten years already?' is a question I find myself asking far too often these days, and I shudder to think how aged I'll feel my work has become in ten more years. Truly, life has changed immensely for me and for my music, across the last decade, and recordings like Inland only serve to highlight this disparity. For all of its fixation on self-analysis and location reference, the work I did on Inland (and by extension, Pawleys Island) feels less important now than it did before. Perhaps, this is because I have already done the work? And in doing so, I've come to some kind of terms with what it was attempting to organize and frame? Or, perhaps I am ten years older, and there's no longer a sense that I should keep these memories around, or write everything down, proverbially speaking. The past is only ever the past, so is there really a point in focusing on it to this degree? \n\n\n\nBut you, dear listener, did not come here to read my babbling philosophizing, at least I hope you didn't. You came here because this album meant something to you before, and you, like me, are probably wondering what it might mean to you now. Or, you're simply unaware of it, which is really the practical reason for me reinstating what I think of as 'key works' in the name of highlighting their intended importance, and for the posterity of keeping these things available to newcomers. To you, whoever you are, and wherever you may positionally be in relation to my music, I would like to say that Inland is very much like a photograph of a place and a time, but not so much a person, as I felt it may have been more of a self-portrait at that time. It is a melodic ambient album that crystallizes specific locations, temperatures and events from the last landscape I inhabited before I moved to Columbia with the love of my life, and left my nascent debris behind forever. There are field recordings from Loris and light trails from North Myrtle Beach, burnt into the tracks in equal measure, and listening to these arrangements now feels even more like a dream than it probably did ten years ago. \n\n\n\nI'm glad these things are behind me now, ultimately. I feel happy, lucky even, that I was able to express these things long ago, because it also means that I have not had to carry them around with me while I've been raising a daughter. Inland is like all of my so-called autobiographical compositions (and there aren't that many), a book that is half-remembered and placed on a shelf in a uniform fashion, accumulating dust from every calendar day that passes without being opened, and when the time comes for me to find that book again, and thumb through its pages, the thing that I notice about it is the distance now present between the me that produced the work and the me reappraising it. And to be candid, I'm okay with that too - I am more than content to let these things be what they are (and perhaps always were), and not try to imprint upon them some level of importance or meaning that isn't really there.\n\n\n\n'Hindsight is 20/20' as my father always liked to tell me, and while I've long felt that it is the lot of the artist to take liberties with the world we find ourselves in, in order to make it not better or worse, but simply more bearable, I also feel that it is important not to editorialize the past too much. What happened, happened. And I am glad that it did. I am also glad that it is over and done with. Regardless of how I feel about it today, I would not be here if I did not first come from somewhere else, and at 39 years old it is more apparent than it has ever been that I am always coming from somewhere, on my way to somewhere else. \n\n\n\nInland by Night is itself, in name and form, a document of motion, a tracing of a line on a map from the sea to the trees, and what I didn't know ten years ago, that I am only realizing now, is that this line never stopped moving. It continued onward to Columbia, the heart of the Carolinas, further still up on a Northwestern arc, through the Blue Ridge mountains, and past the peaks of the Appalachians, and settled instead within a Midwestern river valley, dressed in all four seasons, a hearth in the Far Hills that I could not know would feel so complete to me, until I arrived.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nN.B. - This edition of Inland by Night has not been remastered, but instead, augmented with the addition of a live recording from October 2021, 'Valley in Repose', which used the R-EW Audioholistics modular system (alongside a few other synthesizers) to transfigure tape loops from the Pawleys/IBN composition 'Barefoot Stargazer' into an extended reprise, a ghostly echo of a decade past that wakes up in the bottom of the leafy ravine, still remembering the cloudy treelines in a blue dream, and burns itself up in the rays of the dawning sun. \n\n\n\n'Valley in Repose' is also being made available separately, for those who already possess Inland by Night and do not wish to purchase it a second time (  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/valley-in-repose  ). \n\n\n\nAdditionally, no less than three rehearsal takes of 'Repose' have been identified while assembling this reissue, and have themselves been given a separate release bearing the name 'Migration' (  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/migration  )",

      "about": "PULVERIZER is, perhaps like BY A RIVER before it, a psychedelic ambient techno session that exists purely in the wake of the ASTRAL SALONS series. A fully polymetric composition, built out of a revolving set of rhythms, melodic passages and basslines that never overlap in quite the same way, due to their differing bar lengths. Techno has always been defined by hypnotic (and even surrealistic) sound experiences, and I feel that reconsidering the fundamentals of the structures and tropes of the genre itself, at the molecular level, is a way forward into new and vivid lands. It is my interest to further explore and develop polymetric forms within the techno template as a working method, and see where these near-generative systems take the music as they become more and more involved. \n\n\n\nMusically, PULVERIZER began with raw samples from a piezoelectric microphone, held with rubber bands to an aluminum grinder for marijuana plantmatter. In the stoner community, it is a popular practice to place a coin inside the chamber that holds the ground up flower, and shake it vigorously, pushing the trichomes (small THC-concentrated deposits in the leaves) through a secondary screen, into a lower chamber that collects them into a powdery sticky substance called kief. My grandfather, born to Italian immigrants in New York, collected many different foreign coins when he was enlisted in the service, in WWII, and when I was a small boy he gave me a cigar box filled with them. I picked out a Franc from 1932 and cleaned it up for use in my aluminum grinder, and almost immediately hatched the idea to record the pings with a piezo, and use them as trigger sources within my modular system. \n\n\n\nWhat you hear then, is a pasture of dub chords, generated with the voice of a vocoder, and triggered by these impulses from the 1932 Franc. With this sonic bed laid before me, I went to work shaping more melodies, bass, rhythms and so on, once again finding the statue inside the stone, feeling as if I was not creating or constructing, but merely locating existing peripheries within these triggered chords. All of the rhythms, besides two drum breaks that enter in the second half, are built with vintage Yamaha, Korg and Roland drum machines (Yammy RX11, RX21L, Korg KPR77, Roland TR505) and most of the overlaid lead sections were made using Yamaha TX81Z and Korg Volca FM synthesizers, while the arpeggiator in the ending is from a Roland SH-32 digital polysynth. \n\n\n\nThe entire session was dubbed and mixed while stoned on the same kief that the triggers originated from, but mastered and finalized while sober (because I'm still not yet solid enough to fully complete the equation while under the influence). While it remains my preference to work sober, and only check mixes for changes while under any chemical influence, PULVERIZER could be seen as a small exception to this ethos, as it was designed from top to bottom in anticipation of the 4/20 stoner's holiday. Whether or not you're a weed geek like I am shouldn't matter, as the only real point of celebrating marijuana on a calendar date is to hopefully draw attention to the beneficial nature of finding something that works for you as an individual, and perhaps normalizing it just a little bit more. With medicinal and recreational usage, as well as full decriminalization, we can embrace something more natural and beneficial, with a slight bend toward psychedelic experiences, serving to jailbreak a bit of empathy in our baby animal brains, and maybe even leave behind more harmful vices like alcohol, nicotine and pharmaceuticals. However you get through the night, that's up to you - I hope PULVERIZER and the wider Coppice Halifax catalog enriches your passage.",

      "about": "The second set of Pharmlands sessions, like the first, were built out of a long and convoluted process, transfiguring the raw chordal oceans of the fourth year of Workingman's Drone into something more dubbed and psychedelic. Using adjacent utilities, like a Yamaha RX11 drum machine, and multiple samplers (Korg Volca, Korg ES-1, Akai S2800) it was possible to return to the \"template\" I established with the first Pharmlands session, migrating the new drone composts into a familiar setting, and seeing what sprung forth from the Urth. In this way, Pharmlands II directly resumes where Pharmlands left us before, like a reliable harvester machine, freshly oiled and pump-primed, blades sharpened, ready to reap another season's golden fields along a well-tread path in the dirt. \n\n\n\nLongtime listeners will find a wealth of sonic landscaping here, with plenty of sub-bass tropicalia to recall past lives such as Ocean Lion, Verdant Acre, Green Shape and Ferrolog. The wash of detritus and filtered noise that shimmers around the soundwaves may also bring to mind Impressionistic jaunts such as Dripping Earth and Static Pharming - the latter being a de-facto influence in breaking ground on Pharmlands to begin with. Pharmlands recordings are designed with a flexible listening utility in mind - loud volumes, low volumes, headphones or open-air acoustics. It bends and melts according to the space it inhabits, and I am happy to let it carry me where it will.",

      "about": "**UPDATE APRIL 2024*** River Mural has been remastered, and given a beautiful physical edition for the first time ever. A factory duplicated CD with a new cover painted by Greg Lawhun is available on its own, or in the \"River Lux\" bundle that also includes Milieu's Mural Hex CD-R and Across the Surface of the Water 2xCD-R - both River Mural-adjacent works. If you previously purchased River Mural here, this release has been updated free of charge with the new remastered audio and painted cover - cheers!\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nRiver Mural began as an unexpected session of chordal dub forms, emanating from Behringer's reproduction of the Blue Marvin ARP 2600 analog synthesizer (operating alongside my R-EW modular system), and seven takes were recorded, each somewhat similar in terms of the patching, but distinct enough from each other to represent variations. From here, I migrated the sessions into my DAW for finer detailing and overdub work - initially planned as some basslines and drum machine programming, perhaps some FX and filtering - and very quickly, the album that sits before you now, the *real* River Mural, coalesced into being. \n\n\n\nRiver Mural is something I'm proud of having done, but not for any of the usual reasons. Having just recently completed what can only be described as a months-long gauntlet of intense and exhausting composition work for The Flower to Disappear, I was certain that, as before, I'd need some time away from composed music again before being able to sit down and write anything worthwhile. Usually, this is where things like the Deep Earth and Vibratelepathos series are essential for me to explore generative and unorthodox ideas, recharging my creative batteries, so to speak, and once I've spent enough time in that method of working, I get the itch all over again, and dive back into something more programmatic and composed. River Mural defies this notion completely, being completed, start to finish, in less than one week, and so close on the heels of The Flower to Disappear, which was released on June 23rd, only two months ago. It is because of recordings like this, which come together seemingly on their own, and fast, that I am often riddled with second-guesses and doubts, asking myself whether or not I am truly happy with something, or if I'm only momentarily satisfied, and yet somehow, River Mural feels more accomplished and defined, even considering those things. \n\n\n\nI cannot quite explain what I feel so connected to in these pieces. They feel as if they were made reactively, me going in to find the relative keys and possible melodic motifs that would harmonically work with the ARP sessions, and instead of finding something more dub techno, I found these gorgeous melodic developments, which now only serve to cast even more uncertainty on the already deeply held sense that I am not actually *making* anything, but rather, *finding* it. The title is a multifaceted one, referring topically to a mural painted on the side of a white brick building next to the Waccamaw river in Conway, South Carolina, which I passed by most every day I lived there growing up, becoming less and less the thing that it actually was - a painting of a steamboat on a building wall - and more and more some intangible piece of the fabric that made up the substance of my entire world...as much a part of the atmosphere as the temperature, or the river itself. Thematically, the name refers to my current philosophical outlook regarding creative work (and for the deep divers among you, I've penned an essay about that here:  weltlandschaft.bandcamp.com/album/heaven-is-a-glass-forever-machine  ) which, in summary, posits that no creative thought can ever be considered finished, that the creative act is an impulsive act of expression undertaken simply for the joy (or other emotional response) of doing so, and that in considering this, I can be free to express myself outside of any external constructs such as public expectations, format limitations and so on. \n\n\n\nSo, the River Mural is just that - an exploration of something to what seemed to be its logical terminus, only to find that where I ended up was somewhere entirely other than where I set out to go. This is so often the nature of the creative act, especially my own numerous tangents within it, and as I have continued down this path beside the river, I have become more and more content with things simply being what they already are, not pushing too hard, or trying to say something \"profound\" every time I hit the record button. The profundity is in the act of doing it at all, the recording is simply a document of that process having come to pass. And, as is also my usual with these passages of copy, I end up discussing so many facets of what precipitated the recordings, and hardly pay any attention to what those recordings actually sound like. \n\n\n\nThe surrealism of that element is yet another part of what makes River Mural feel unique - like Tigress, Pink Acre and Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker before it, River Mural feels in parts that it is not a Coppice Halifax album at all, but rather, a Milieu album. I contemplated issuing it as I did Sun Cast - billing it as Milieu & Coppice Halifax - but in the end, it came down to percentages, and I think the greater percentage of what's here resembles CH more, but as I said above, these things can only ever be what they already are, and what they are is music made by the same one mind, two ears, two hands, two eyes, regardless of whatever organizational dividers I choose to place upon it. Perhaps, one day, there will be no escaping this, and I will simply issue all the things I record under my birthname and let aliases be damned. For now, know that I am very aware of the in-between-worlds nature of River Mural, and I enjoy that aspect of it very much. \n\n\n\nIn this way, putting the word \"mural\" into the title is appropriate, because it genuinely feels like the Conway mural of my youth, something more than what actuality would imply, a part of an ambient world where the only meanings and definitions that exist are those that I place emphasis on, and so that white brick wall, decorated in eroded paint by some artist whose name I still today do not know, could be all that remains now of that small town by the river, the rest of the real world simply vaporized in a flash of redundancy, cast into the sunny river waters like carefree stones, Earth to Earth, as it always is.",

      "about": "The shore is different now, things are not where I quite remembered them to be, and at low tide it's possible to see a ruined temple just beneath the waves at the edge of the sand. I set up a small camp for the night, and pass out reading an old yellowed paperback. The sun breaks the next day, prying open my slumbering eyelids, and an overwhelming sensation of being surrounded by exotic colors and equatorial perfumes comes on fast. Before I can find my footing, I'm pulled beneath the waves again in the undertow. Held fast beneath the surface, I'm stopped from being displaced further out into the sea by the eroded but anchored stone walls of the ruin. Panic sets in, but just when I feel as if I cannot hold my breath any longer, a strange weightlessness comes over me and I realize I don't need to. \n\n\n\nThe sun ripples down in fluttering lines from above the sea, casting surrealistic phosphenes across the temple's marbled stone pillars, giving vague outlines of what the structure may have looked like before nature reclaimed it. Orange and blue weave in and out, pulsing with a steadily accumulating chordal sound that paralyzes me in a pleasant but otherwise indescribable claustrophobia. I cannot tell how long I've been under the water, as nothing feels real anymore, but disconnected, as if I'm seeing things from a vantage point outside of my body. There are no longer any sensations to determine where my skin ends, and where the sea begins. \n\n\n\nSomething begins to ebb me slowly back toward the surface, to the shore. Am I dying? Am I hallucinating? Something, a voiceless soundless thought manifests in my mind - just odd shapes and angular but deliberate phrases - and I begin to sense that I have not been entirely alone, here in the ocean. With this, I'm thrust back above the waves, now diminished beneath a sinking purple sun, in a moment that is neither before nor after. A transfiguration, a pocket universe that seems to evade both time and space, has stolen me away and returned me to the sand. I have been momentarily borrowed, in some kind of communion or conversation - or a conversion? Convergence? The words come slowly back to my pulverized mind, like a child knowing deep down what to say but unable to form the syllables on the tongue to say it. \n\n\n\nBy the time I feel stable enough to stand, with the haze around me fizzled away, I cannot remember the sensation anymore. I look at my hands, covered in glimmering beach sand, and reach up to an aching throbbing head, filled with the hot fruit of a scrambled brain. My paperback lies split open, pages down on the sand, wedged between my chest and the ground. I bend down to pick the book up, looking with mild curiosity at what page I'd find, and I'm speechless as my fried brain cannot quite process what my eyes are seeing: The pages no longer have any words on them, despite the cover remaining what it was - an old Pohl anthology called \"Star 3\" - but instead, an array of symbols, holding my gaze unnaturally. \n\n\n\nThe more I look, and try to determine what they are, the more they burn into my mind, taking with them any sense of certainty, any idea that might logically explain what is happening. It's all I can do to quickly shut the book, and in that moment, I'm struck by a blinding flash of light, as if a camera went off in my face. As the brightness fades, the book is gone - not fallen from my shaking hands, but gone. Another feeling approaches, from deep in my chest, a knowing dawning awareness that I am once again alone. \n\n\n\nStanding here on a beach, the stars above slowly peeking out of the inky black firmament, I can only think of the waves, recursive and mindless, compelled to forever clamber back up to the land, only to be taken away again, and I feel lucky that I am not like them. I dust off my clothes, look in the opposite direction at the green bearded valley further inland, and begin to walk back home.",

      "about": "Following the extensive overdubs necessary to complete PULVERIZER for an April 20th release date, curiosity won out (as it always does) and I decided to approach the various dubbed sections like a sandbox to play in, and with only some slight adjustments to the same machines used for the rhythms and bass, a completely new piece of music materialized. \n\n\n\nANTIDOTE is a fiftyfive-minute dub out, filled with several layers of chordal synthesizer structures, foggy melodic composition and polymetric drum and bass programming. Recalling prior recordings such as FERROLOG or even aspects of the OCEAN LION series, ANTIDOTE seems to inhabit familiar terrain in the Halifaxian acreage, while still possessing arrangement, mixing and processing traits that set it apart from anything that may have come before it. \n\n\n\nInitially, the intent was to attach ANTIDOTE to PULVERIZER, as a more ambient \"come down\" after the psychedelic peaks of PULVERIZER, but after some consideration, the decision was made to keep the two separate, to not only outline their differences rather than their similarities, but to let each stand more singularly alone in the catalog. With all things in my creative process, there are analogs to every moment, and while the versions and variations are never the same as their original counterparts, it is fascinating to examine the many tributaries that diverge from only a handful of ideas. It is as if time of day, temperature and barometric pressure are themselves enough elemental force to influence what may be derived from the same hands, acting on the same ideas, with the same tools. The more I learn, the less I know.",

      "about": "Migration consists of eight ambient pieces, extracted from three different rehearsal sessions that were recorded in preparation for Pawleys Island's 10th anniversary release party, which was broadcast live on October 29, 2021. The initial plan, upon rediscovering these rehearsals while organizing the release of the broadcast itself (see: Valley in Repose), was to append them to a solo release of Valley in Repose, but after delving a bit deeper into the audio in order to figure out what sections could be suitable for release, it became clear that this was altogether a different album of music. \n\n\n\nWhile aspects of Migration's provenance sometimes emerge clearly, the majority of this material creeps in like a fog, with fragments of melody and chordal shifts occasionally surfacing. For longtime listeners, Migration perhaps most resembles prior recordings like Ocean Lion III or even aspects of the Deep Earth triple-album Kosma. Following on those tripartite works, Migration does not differ, as the collective runtime fills out a full three-discs of sound. A triptych of triptychs. \n\n\n\nThese details aside, Migration can simply be a warm bed to drift to sleep on, manifesting somewhere between the Halifaxian coastline and the deep green valley next to the White Pillar Workshop. A softened edge of ambient fabric to drape over the Autumn season.",

      "about": "DUSK RELICT is a double-album of two deep techno meditations, undertaken during a snow-flurried final gasp of Winter. Mining from the source sounds harvested during last year's DUSK VERSIONS remastered reissue, a distinctly Halifaxian palette is used to weave one last warm blanket in the dimming of the coldest season, a long sleep of resignation, willing and resolute in the need to be put to rest so that newer and greener things may come to fruition. It's been a difficult Winter, between the continued pandemic, the war in Europe and of course the tumultuous transitions in my personal life, and for this reason it felt not just apt, but essential, to mark the passage of the season with two definitive lines of demarcation - a view to the past, and a view to whatever comes next.",

      "about": "Premiering on the Deep Breakfast podcast series in Italy (  soundcloud.com/deepbreakfastseries/deep-breakfast-054-coppice-halifax  ) are new longform recordings by Coppice Halifax, for/from a series of works titled Halifaxian Cantos. As the title might imply, these pieces represent the wordless prose of the Halifaxian continent, intimate and minimalistic devotionals sung to the seasons, the sea and the stars beyond them. Coppice Halifax has long maintained an ethos of acting as Aquarius the water-bearer, bringing forth decorative vessels of elemental splendor for both sustenance and reflection, and these Cantos have taken shape via this same approach, using a near-generative process that deifies and transmutes orchestral provenance into the almost infinite. A microcosmic study in ambient techno, drone music and process-driven synthesis, Halifaxian Cantos further explore and christen the unmapped lands of the Halifaxian landscape, offering a recorded output that is both tranquil and evocative in their wake. Longtime CH listeners will appreciate noticeable references to Verdant Acre, Reflector, Ferrolog, Dripping Earth and the now-numerous Arborist's Excavations in these works.\n\n\n\nN.B. (2022/02/08): It's difficult to accept that it's already been almost a full year since Cantos III, and not having looked at a calendar prior to penning this copy, something within me is not surprised to know that I found my way back to this path somewhat cyclically - snowed under, all but praying for that first gasp of green Spring to burst forth from the ice. Bach's music holds many contexts and meanings for me personally, and among them is absolutely a sense of allowing creative impulse to run freely, in the hope that it will bring you closer to god, whoever or whatever god may actually be - and what could be more representative of the divine than Spring itself? A season of violent rebirth, the manifestation of life by unseen hands, reclaiming its dominion over the land, the air and the sea. A refutation of the void, a temporary reprieve from death and decay, a recursive returning to follow old age's quiet end. So here we are again, hearing these wordless hymnals evaporated into the sun, feeling as if we have been here before, but unable to really say for sure. The Cantos thrum onward, upward, knowing no bounds.\n\n\n\nN.B. March 2022 - It has been almost exactly one year since I last explored this avenue of my work on Cantos III. This fourth volume diverges from prior volumes in many ways, the most obvious being that there are eight distinct sections of Bach's fourth cantata with which to compost, as opposed to the six sections of the first three cantatas. This volume feels as if it is between emotions to me - standing on a wavering line between light and darkness, not fully in either part of the world, existing in a tenuous state of imbalance and asymmetry. Parts of it still recall the triumphant fanfares of the first two volumes, and others reach for (but do not quite grasp) the abyssal depths of the third. Perhaps it is simply a state of transition I'm observing, or perhaps I am actually imprinting upon these pieces that sensation. The world is a tense and uncertain place, moreso than it has ever been in my lifetime, and much as I cannot be anything but what I already am, my work cannot ever exist as anything but what it already is. Somewhere in this clouded mirror, I may yet find a face, though whether or not I will recognize it is anyone's guess.",

      "about": "Autochromata IV follows three volumes of dense minimal techno and generatively processed drone music, the last of which was issued five years ago, during the Summer of 2017. As a series, Autochromata was always designed to remain open-ended, and focus on deliberate use of lossy file conversions, low-bitrate audio and heavily artifacted sound, often culled from other studio sessions and reprocessed into a Halifaxian shape, draped over techno rhythms and sub bass. \n\n\n\nThis fourth iteration continues on that path, with fifty minutes of deep dubby techno pulses that phase in and out of focus beneath layers of tape-eroded ambience and heavily weathered FM synthesizers. In many ways, Autochromata IV also directly picks up where the recently completed Astral Salons series finished its work, while also recalling much earlier CH sessions such as Cornucopiad or Earthworks.",

Elastic minimal techno that can be enjoyed in the intimacy of soft headphones or felt in the chest through a public address system, like all the techno-minded Halifaxian recordings. \n\n\n\nThe pulse is only an anchor, as close or as distant as you'd like it to be, a drowsy-eyed tether to the center of the Urth, rotating and repeating itself until the mindless oscillation gives way to hallucinatory visions of the divine.",

      "about": "Another year, another series, another branch in the long path of exploring my creative continents. 2021 brings us to ASTRAL SALONS, a nine-section series of monthly EP installments that land somewhere between STATIC PHARMING and SILHOUETTES, bridging the corporeal and the cosmic in concise twenty-minute jaunts that are designed to groove and meander in equal measure, and hopefully do not overstay their welcome. The digital 4x12\" FERINE ALEMBIX could be seen as a precursor for this series, as those sessions put me back in the mood to produce an EP series again, and further, ASTRAL SALONS are not just informed by their more \"modest\" runtimes, but also a very fresh and unique approach to modulation, stereo panning and sonic depth-of-field that I've played with in the past, but haven't yet focused so completely upon until now.\n\n\n\nPaired with these sessions are nine Polaroids shot using expired film, on the day of the August 21st, 2017 total solar eclipse. I felt that these images were appropriate analogs for the concept of the series, being surrealist and psychedelic multi-layered pieces with deliberately lossy artifacting, overexposed processing and overlaps of FX processes in motion that leave \"holes\" in the sound field. The photographs are presented as they were developed, with only some contrasting and digital cleanup work done in post, again mirroring my studio process for the ASTRAL SALONS sessions.\n\n\n\n**A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR 09/21: Extemporal Phase is the ninth of nine planned EPs in the Astral Salons series. While this EP is indeed the final of the PHASE designated catalog entries, three more adjacent/supplemental recordings are planned to fill out the remainder of the calendar year. These pieces will diverge from the Astral Salons blueprint slightly, and as such, are being given the designation of \"Tributaries,\" and can be expected to explore certain details and aspects of Astral Salons sessions in greater focus.",

      "about": "Following the completion of the nine phases in the ASTRAL SALONS series, it felt strange to run a monthly series for only three-quarters of the year, when all prior monthly serials have been a full 12 month run. So, the idea was drafted earlier in the Spring to finish out the series with three extended encore releases, each a full album-length session of Halifaxian deep listening that would contrast against the more melodic and densely-designed EPs with a more minimalistic approach.\n\n\n\nWith this in mind, I'm happy to publish TRIBUTARY THREE of THREE in the epilogue of ASTRAL SALONS. This volume, VERMILION PHASE, echoes the previous two phases (COBALT/QUARTZ) in that it recalls the prior season within a piece recorded following its passing. Here, VERMILION PHASE utilizes a field recording of leaves blown by the wind during the first week Autumn here in the valley, reflecting on the decline of a busy year as it descends into frozen stillness. The tributaries that have run across the Halifaxian map for the last twelve months have accumulated into a wise and untamed river, terminating here and now at our feet, their tenuous streams and blue longing almost unrecognizable in this rush of white noise and weathered Earth. Musically brimming with melodic passages and sweeping chordal arcs, VERMILION feels much like an extended reprise of EXTEMPORAL PHASE, especially given the prominent use of similar FM synthesizers to create bass and lead sounds. Bubbling over with references to map points all over the Halifaxian continent, from Solus to Ocean Lion, the recent Woven triptych and even the Analog Botany series, VERMILION is filled with a palpable sense of resolution and resolve. \n\n\n\nFrom here to who-knows-where: an ASTRAL SALONS collection with or without bonus material may or may not yet be issued in '22.",

      "about": "DUSK VERSIONS was originally recorded during the same sessions in 2010 undertaken for material that was issued on split releases with Axs and Ohrwert at the now-defunct Other Heights label in 2011. At the time, it was an exercise in finality and closure, seeking to simmer down the oft-revisited Analog Botany series cut \"Dusk\" and solidify it into a night ritual of subdued bass, dub rhythms and softened chords reverberating in digital spaces large and small. Using classic dub compilation albums such as Echospace's Grandbend and Vantage Isle as a partial template, \"Dusk\" was explored and transfigured in every possible way, resulting in a tableaux of sonic matter that orbited a single setting sun, but never presented it directly or clearly. These were other peripheral dusks, sunsets on other worlds, in other times, reachable only through careful navigation with a key in the shape of a flat white circle. \n\n\n\nToday, ten years later, DUSK VERSIONS is again an exercise in closure, this time having to unexpectedly handle this reissue as some kind of sendoff for my late canine Charly, who was perfectly suited to his portrait on the album cover, taken with my Holga CFN120 camera in the golden hour, in the living room of my old place across the street from the Columbia water tower. I'd have no idea that the year DUSK VERSIONS would celebrate a 10th anniversary, Charly would himself pass on after a seven-year battle with various health problems. This expanded reissue is subsequently being dedicated to his memory - long may he roam the windy fields of the distant planets that DUSK VERSIONS conveys, chasing after cats and squirrels until he contentedly passes out beneath the warmest blanketing sunbeam. \n\n\n\nBereavement aside, I would like to also highlight how happy I am with this particular remaster and reissue, among the many others that have slowly come to celebrate their tenth (or later) birthdays. I'm not quite sure what makes it so special to me, but I can confidently state that this is the best DUSK VERSIONS has ever sounded. Perhaps it's just down to the decade of dubbing and mastering I've since done, all the trials and all the errors charting a path forward, for better and for worse, into whatever part of my peculiar artistic journey I currently reside. It is my sincere hope that DUSK VERSIONS provides you with many more nightly rituals, with or without substances of your choosing, and I raise a sip of whisky to Charly and ask you to join me in our happy farewell of another long and arduous year. Perhaps I'll see you around another sun, setting on another bedroom carpet, in another ten years. \n\n\n\nFor the trainspotters, extra care has been taken to include all relevant versions of \"Dusk\" that are not themselves remixes by other producers (there are several by Ohrwert, Grad_U, Axs, Quantic, Zzzzra and others omitted here - these mixes are included on the still available Spring Blend album:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/spring-blend  ). Here you shall find a remastered set of the original two \"Dusk\" tracks from Analog Botany 12, the entire six-track Dusk Versions album that was originally published at Recycled Plastics, both takes of Spring Blend (which originated from the same sessions), the bonus 3\" EP of \"Dusk\" variations included in some copies of the Analog Botany 13x3\" box set (including the extended cut of \"Overgrowth\" in both beatless and original mixes), and closing the double-disc affair is a brand new half-hour \"Excavation\" of \"Dusk\" - revisiting the original source materials and tape loops with modern hands, ears and equipment.",

      "about": "Following the completion of the nine phases in the ASTRAL SALONS series, it felt strange to run a monthly series for only three-quarters of the year, when all prior monthly serials have been a full 12 month run. So, the idea was drafted earlier in the Spring to finish out the series with three extended encore releases, each a full album-length session of Halifaxian deep listening that would contrast against the more melodic and densely-designed EPs with a more minimalistic approach. \n\n\n\nWith this in mind, I'm happy to publish TRIBUTARY ONE of THREE in the epilogue of ASTRAL SALONS. This volume, COBALT PHASE, consists of a late Summer-recalling of Spring's vibrant blues and greens, a rain-softened paean to the bubbling drips and streams that gradually slink down through the valleys and drains and eventually coalesce into train-lines of river water. Eroded and filter-passed chordal sections from prior CH sessions play out across long tape loops, routed through the knowing and transfigurative ecosystem of the R-EW Audioholistics modular system, cast like surrealistic hills and forests against a gradient skyline made of a pulsing cicada wall in the sun white sun, ebbed forward and balanced by a rhythmic structure conveyed on a digital Korg sampler and analog Arturia monosynth. COBALT PHASE conjures up blurry visions of past excavations such as WHITEHOPE, HALIFAXIAN CANTOS, DRIPPING EARTH, SILHOUETTES and my two extended remixes for VARIANT at his ECHOSPACE label, and would appeal to fans of those works.",

      "about": "REFLECTOR was originally issued in two limited editions at the now-defunct French label Entropy - the first edition was a blue paint-spattered disc held inside a tall and thin silver case, and the second edition came in a more \"standardized\" digipak with a pop-out feature that ejected the disc when you opened the gatefold - and since 2012 or thereabouts, it has remained out of print. In that time, I've been told by a good many people that REFLECTOR is a favorite of theirs from the Halifaxian continent, and although I myself can't say I share that level of enthusiasm about it, I have always acknowledged how singular it felt within that landscape. \n\n\n\nREFLECTOR began as nothing more than extended minimalist versions of the four tracks on RADIANS, which was scheduled for release at several different labels before ending up published at Recycled Plastics, and the focus of the session was to reduce the RADIANS tracks down to their barest of elements and reiterate their tonal-matter across a very simple and restrained path. At the time, I was doing this because I felt that RADIANS could have been better, although I enjoyed those tracks enough to leave them be and instead attempting fully separate second passes with the source material. From the molecular level upward, REFLECTOR is named such simply because it reflected its lineage in RADIANS while clearly inhabiting a different space. \n\n\n\nSo, what did I change, in my transition from the session elements that built RADIANS, to the drastically altered monoliths of REFLECTOR? To begin, chordal synth patches were bounced through several generations of tape degradation, before being re-filtered themselves to bring out new contours and overtones. Drums were sampled at intentionally low bitrates and rendered down to mono. Bass elements were migrated into the session in a more pure sine-tone fashion, but were hardly used at all in the final work (only the fourth and final track contains a proper bassline at all). \n\n\n\nReduce, refine, reshape, reduce again was more or less the working methodology, and in the end, the resultant four tracks resembled a few different shades of CH releases yet to come - Whitehope's multiple iterations, the Earthworks albums and the Autochromata series all spring to mind - while also recalling prior droned-out albums like Ocean Lion, Pacific Opal Hex and Winter Blurring. It felt almost immediately as if it were the missing junction point between many different poles of my work, while still itself remaining hard to define. \n\n\n\nTen years after, it's an interesting note to leave the 2021 year on - almost a last-minute ceremony to schedule before the next tide sweeps these miserable months away. I find my relationship with REFLECTOR is even more alienated than ever, with the original tracks sounding almost completely different from how my mind remembers their sound. Until I sat down to work on remastering it this year, I hadn't listened to REFLECTOR in a few years. I remember it being very loop-fixated and hypnotically hovering through all the bass work, but the actual shape and pacing and temperature of the whole thing feels utterly unrecognizable to me. You'd think this sensation would happen more often with my back catalog, given how much of it there is now, but to be honest with you, REFLECTOR feels as unique in my mind now as it did then. \n\n\n\nFor the occasion of this 10th anniversary celebration, I've revisited REFLECTOR not just for a new-coat-of-paint remaster, but to put my hands back down into the soil and see what I might build using modern tools and my current production habits. A single session was held for every track on REFLECTOR, completing the triptych of this material now manifesting in the form of three different four-track albums, from RADIANS to REFLECTOR to RELICT, a full reimagining of these four stellar bodies using only the original source materials that built REFLECTOR a decade ago. \n\n\n\nRELICT bridges the distance between RADIANS' vocoder chord and dub-spatter techno and REFLECTOR's droned out loop-pastures, with melodic patches of polymetrically sequenced chords over a bed of warm bass, kick drum anchors and resonator drones. The RELICT session, as many modern CH sessions do, yielded more new curiosities than resolutions, so a branching release from this point of origin with RELICT will follow at some point in 2022. \n\n\n\nFor now, both REFLECTOR and RELICT offer a look in both directions - flawed recall of the past and hopeful estimation of the future - and together they summarize many of my current emotions and considerations about the 2021 year, and the new era of Milieu Music that is soon to follow.",

      "about": "WOVEN is a new Halifaxian landscape to explore, either intimately with headphones or physically with loudspeakers, followed like a tangential path from the ASTRAL SALONS sessions throughout the 2021 year. A triptych of pieces, not unlike previous issuances like A BLUE FUME, PACIFIC OPAL HEX or SNOW VESSEL, WOVEN offers three variations on a single approach, all while naming none as the definitive original work. In this way, the album is left open-ended to further investigation and production work, despite being published here as a finished product. \n\n\n\nOn a deeper level, the compositions presented on WOVEN are very much in a shared state between the Halifaxian and Milieu worlds, much in the same way SUN CAST deliberately blurred the boundaries between the two projects. WOVEN seeks to further indicate that any such boundaries between creative output are arbitrary and constructed, as the mind and tools utilized to create it are the same ones used to create the rest of the varied and colorful Milieu Music catalog (as ridiculous as that implication really is) - putting forth the notion that it is best to enjoy the shared space between ideas, rather than trying to keep fixed lines of trespass rigidly surrounding them.\n\n\n\nWOVEN is literally and figuratively both Milieu and CH, and neither of them, although for ease of cataloguing, I've elected to use CH as the sole moniker on the label, as most of the shapes conveyed here resemble more techno and dub profiles when taken as a whole. Perhaps, in another where and when, WOVEN is a Milieu album, or a split title, or none of these. The peripheral considerations of what WOVEN attempts to do are interesting to think about, but ultimately, overshadowed by the recordings themselves. \n\n\n\nMusically, WOVEN operates on a complex system of incommensurable sequencing work, made possible by digital audio workstations and extensive use of odd-numbered and incongruent polymeter, although it is my intent to also present these systems not as the entirety of WOVEN's listening experience, but rather, a foundation upon which new and distinct melodic passages may be explored, that rhythms and grooves elasticize and mutate over time, where a truly hypnotic soundfield of psychedelic audio events and textures can flourish in a completely accessible way. Polymeter has long been a standard and accepted method of composing for other genres of music, from jazz to metal to chamber music, but I myself have yet to find it so purposefully (and hopefully, eloquently) utilized in melody-driven electronic dance music. Perhaps I'm only now becoming aware of some other long-known aspect of composition work, and for that (as well as a whole host of other reasons), I am fully willing to admit to being a slow learner who has likely spent far too much time isolated from many different ideas that the artistic world and history have to offer. \n\n\n\nRegardless of my feelings on the subject, and all technical and conceptual jargon set aside, it is my sincere hope that these pastures of sound that have enthralled my senses and excited my mind with more and more new ideas than I had when I began working, also manage to connect on either a topical and/or a subconscious level for you too. WOVEN is one of the rare instances in my constant method of working that makes me stop and listen a little more, before moving on to the next phase of satisfying my impulsive curiosities, and I am much more content with it now being a shared experience.",

Here, QUARTZ PHASE utilizes a field recording of an intense thunderstorm in June (following the touchdown of a tornado nearby) to conjure up the Summer heat and humidity alongside a pulsing dub rhythm, rainsoaked chords and splashy percussion. Topical (some may say obvious) influences on QUARTZ PHASE are Pub's classics \"Summer\" and \"Lunch\" as well as Deepchord's varied and prolific 12\"s on Soma, all channeled through a very Halifaxian landscape, painted with raw elements like yellow sunshine, blue rainwater and red electricity. A Summer blanket of deep techno and ambient dub to curl up with as the Autumn blows its leafy wind through the valley, happy to be remembered in keeping the warmer weather at a comfortable distance.",

      "about": "Ten years ago, in a humid Carolinian October in 2011, I issued the first edition of Pawleys Island - an album that represents many different things, personally and creatively, in the Halifaxian landscape. A decade passing over this double-album seems to have phased it none, as I don't mind admitting that Pawleys has remained such a staple of interest in the Milieu Music catalog that it has not once gone out of print since it was first released. The first edition was a double-cassette, housed in a very finite amount of dustproof audiobook cases that were mailed to me by a very generous librarian friend in New Zealand, whose library was emptying out a lot of old cassette stock. This edition came and went very quickly, leading almost immediately to a 2xCD-R edition, which has since returned through three different iterations, and is still available today. \n\n\n\nSo, how then do you celebrate a 10th anniversary for a special record that has never gone out of circulation? Making this process more difficult is the additional fact that there are more or less zero outtakes or extra material from Pawleys' sessions, considering the entirety of the 2010 Analog Botany series of 12 monthly EPs was the creative process I designed to \"filter out\" my favorite tracks across a whole year of recording, which were then built into Pawleys Island in 2011. Analog Botany, in and of itself, is all Pawleys Island outtakes, and vice versa. \n\n\n\nAfter months of consideration, the decision was made to simply return to the principal format of the release - a double-cassette reissue for 2021. Initially, I attempted to dig out the original master cassettes to dub new copies from, but being in storage for 10 years, in three different studios (two of which were sweltering and humid rooms in the deep South), the time and transport has not been kind to them. Other financial and material roadblocks emerged as well - tape duplication is far too expensive in 2021 to be done professionally, and even blank cassettes purchased in bulk are much more expensive than they used to be. After locating a stash of suitable tapes for sale second-hand in England, I was ecstatic to jump back into a new dub of Pawleys. I cleaned the heads of my Alesis TapeLink deck and my much older JVC KD-A11 deck in preparation, and even arranged a brand new set of master dubs, somewhat revised to allow for less high-end distortion and some ducking/clipping that was present on the original tapes, and went to work dubbing each side one copy at a time. Two months and eighty 60-minute sides later, I have a reissued double-cassette edition in the same 20-copy print run as the first one in 2011. \n\n\n\nThat is where the similarities end, however. Between my second-hand cassettes of unknown origin shipped from across the Atlantic, my aging tape machines and, for all I know, the incongruity of adapting Carolinian techno to Ohioan electronics in climes and elevation levels 600 miles separated, these 20 re-dubs of Pawleys Island manifested with their age and weathering in full focus. At first, this frustrated me - why can't anything in the analog world ever be easy? After a few weeks of relistening, redubbing, trying different signal-flow options and various other methods, I realized Pawleys still sounds good on crumbly and inconsistent cassette tape. I even began to wonder if perhaps it sounded renewed in this light, as paradoxically opposed as that interpretation may be? \n\n\n\nSo what you see and hear before you is not a picture-perfect reiteration of the past. It is by no means crystal clear, high-fidelity or ageless. This is the sound of Pawleys Island, ten years wizened, calling out from beneath waves of ferric noise and analog mutation. It echoes the very real-world Pawleys Island, which these days is a corporation-curated vacation spot in an area of nothing but corporate interests and yearly tourism money - not at all the subtropical and sun-cast fantasy I remember from my childhood, running around marshy shores in swim trunks with a sand pail and a plastic shovel, digging up clams and crabs and crawfish, chasing my sister with tigertails and passing out in a blissful Summer haze on the van ride back home again. \n\n\n\nThat Pawleys Island is long gone, and likely already was even before I moved away from the state in 2016. Much like the electric plant's twin stacks next to Lake Busbee being demolished, the lake drained out into swampland, Pawleys Island is now a place that only really exists here, on these two eroded cassette tapes, a comfortable escape route taken across spooled brown lines that wobble and bend just like the dirt roads I biked down so many times, bound inland, by night. \n\n\n\nWhat remains is this tableaux of sonic matter, smeared names on a rain-soaked map, fuzzy radio reception, melodies dripping out of a car speaker, a memorial of so many sad nights of teenage longing, the emptiness of vapid parties, the pointless and boundless beach parties happening only because there was never anything else to do. The forever heavy sensation that the real world, full of real and sincere experiences, was just out of reach. A dangerous borderland of modernity that seemed to laugh down at this little coastline of people, drinking and smoking and pilling themselves senseless, because the boredom of not knowing yourself was too much to bear. I didn't make Pawleys until years after I'd moved away from the beach, I couldn't have - it had to manifest when and where it did, a year before I would become a father, during what was in many ways the height of my salad days, though you can never really know those are over until they've slipped away. There's a naivete present in these recordings, a portrait of a place and time painted out beautifully with all of the sorrow left out, perhaps even stirring the notion that Pawleys Island is out there still, a hidden everglade waiting to be happened upon by inebriated teenagers who cannot discern what's a blurry hallucination and what isn't. This album is for them, joyfully ignorant of the life that awaits them, dancing on the graves of lovestruck soldiers and hurricane-swept ruins, where tomorrow never comes. I'm glad to be away and apart from these things and these people now, even if I was one of them in what seems like another lifetime before this one. \n\n\n\nPawleys Island thrums on, heart-beating kick drums and Mellon Collie chords flooding over my bedroom carpet like a high tide rushing in, Atlantic seawater filling up a midwestern valley, soon enough carrying me back down into the sea like some dream-flume bound by the guilty gravities of Deep Earth itself. Happy tenth birthday - we'll see what the water washes up in another ten years.",

      "about": "Originally recorded in Spring of 2021, without any impetus to do so, these two variations on material from the White Pillar sessions were laid to tape and subsequently shelved for a future release. Revisiting them now, in November, when the wind has turned cold and wet, and all the green leaves that were coming to life when these pieces were recorded are now piled up across my lawn in dripping patches of orange, brown and purple, brings to mind a sense of real distance being traveled, and this feels appropriate to address, given the state of intense transition I've been going through this Autumn. \n\n\n\nWPX VERSIONS exists in a unique state that is neither present nor past - it recalls other shapes and times, conveyed through the ever-changing prism of my studio equipment's configuration, and yet it more accurately resembles the ASTRAL SALONS catalog, rather than the White Pillar series it originates from. Perhaps these lines being drawn around projects are detected only by my ears, which must certainly be worn out after so many years of constant need being placed upon them, so I submit these recordings to you in the hopes that they bring you happiness and fantasist escapism at the end of another very long, very dark and very difficult year.",

      "about": "\"We feel the long pulsation, ebb and flow of endless motion, the tones of unseen mystery, the vague and vast suggestions of the\n\nbriny world, the liquid-flowing syllables, the perfume, the faint creaking of the cordage, the melancholy rhythm, the boundless vista and the horizon far and dim are all here, and this is ocean's poem.\"\n\n\n\n-Whitman, 1900\n\n\n\nLust's Nightly Glories was an alternative arrangement of the Coastal Reveries album, which was privately commissioned in 2012 by visual artist and designer Dylan Fisher. It was created for the purpose of providing a more ambient and minimalist portrayal of the Coastal Reveries material, where many of the higher frequency bands were reduced, details were smoothed over and various other post-processing decisions were made concerning pitch, sequencing and texture. Additionally, the album features a completely different backdrop from Coastal Reveries, a blend of field recordings, white and pink noise generators, self-oscillating FX75B flange and other tangible sounds designed to provide a wide lens space for the ambient tonal material to spread out inside. At the time of its creation, it was offered to Fisher alongside Coastal Reveries as a bonus item, an extra bit of gratitude for such a gracious commission, and over time it has taken on more and more gravity in my memory, now feeling as if it can provide an equally potent counterpoint to Coastal Reveries. It was this feeling that informed my decision to offer Lust's Nightly Glories as its own separately reissued release, rather than a bonus disc for Coastal Reveries, and now, almost a decade later, I'm happy to finally give it a distinct place in my catalog for public consumption and consideration.",

      "about": "When the 10th anniversary of the original COASTAL REVERIES session approached, and the first public edition of the album was being updated with a current remastering job, I felt compelled to explore the source material a bit more intimately, as I have for several other remasters, in the interest of producing something new with/from the sonic compost. The result of that tangent is FAMILIAR SHORES, a double-album collecting two longform sessions of excavation that transfigure melodic and field recording content from COASTAL REVERIES over/under a warm sinewave bassline and a kick-drum heartbeat. The two pieces presented here could be considered a missing link between COASTAL REVERIES and things like VERDANT ACRE or OCEAN LION - they are subtropical, saltwater-splashed affairs that still feel terrestrial enough in their Earthy rhythms and chordal longing to indicate that they are not fully oceanic, but stranded on the beach, gazing out to an empty sea, perhaps even considering walking into the waves without a single glance back. FAMILIAR SHORES are aptly named, as they conjure up a sensation of having been here before, despite being altogether unmapped locations. Another romantic excursion up one of the many coastlines of the Halifaxian continent, marked in the travelogue, as the sun sets slowly on another long droned Summer, our footprints almost surely erased as the tide rolls back in.",

      "about": "Following the field-recording triptych Porch Hash Logbook, an exercise in acoustic minimalism and wordless diaries, I pursued a tangent of exploring the possible applications of these field recordings within the framework of dub music. Forming an ouroboros of sorts, these tracks transfigure the sound of THC-doused outdoors into smoky and syrupy deep techno.\n\n\n\nThe recordings were routed through various channels of my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, as well as the vocoder within the Arturia Microfreak and reverberation units such as the Alesis Quadraverb, the Pioneer SR-202W and the Lexicon Alex. Over and under these processing scenarios, I played a Korg ES-1 sampler, which handled basic drumkit and bassline duties, and the final summed mix was sent into a DAW with numerous automation and modulation envelopes, rhythmic gates and slicers and additional FX. Finally, live takes were recorded wherein I'd nudge and pull on the gates and tempo grid, setting into motion many interesting mutations of the source material.\n\n\n\nSonically, these pieces are influenced by early Vladislav Delay, many records in the Chain Reaction catalog, many of Rod Modell's records for Soma, Intrusion, wzrdryAV and JS Zeiter. They are deep and dubbed out compost, with sounds that will likely appeal to fans of Leaf Cloak, Pharmlands/Static Pharming and Verdant Acre.\n\n\n\nThese sessions were immediately followed by a subsequent session of more minimalistic reductions, which are being released separately with the appended label \"Porch Compost\" - to be issued on May 7.",

      "about": "Coastal Reveries was the first of its kind - a privately commissioned work, drafted by Dylan Fisher, a multidisciplinary visual artist in New York, in 2012 - and until now, it has remained unreleased. Although details are foggy, since my daughter was born in April of that same year, I do recall Fisher asking me to create something with a detailed level of specificity in mind. He asked for a recording that could inhabit similar soundworlds as High Hawaiian Fog, Ocean Lion and perhaps other map-points like Verdant Acre - all of these, moments within my catalog that seem to resurface on a regular basis - and I did my damnedest at that moment in time to revisit those spaces, rather than attempt to recreate them. \n\n\n\nIn truth, I find the act of remaking not just tedious, but impossible, for any creative mind that is truly inspired, and especially my own, which seems to thrive on tangents, peripheries, wandering exploration...the act of doing has always been far more rewarding for me than any level of familiarity or nostalgia one might expect to come along with re-approaching prior ideas. So, I'm certain that my acceptance of Fisher's commission came along with such a caveat, that I may not be able to fully find my way back the way I came, and that while I could almost guarantee that the resultant recordings would resemble aspects of the things he'd named, they would likely diverge from those albums just as much. \n\n\n\nSo, off to work I went, and again, memory being unreliable, I want to say I worked on it all through that Summer and Autumn, because one way or another, I'd finished the album by December, and delivered it to Fisher in both physical and digital capacities, with a signed and dated certificate of authenticity, should he ever decide to sell his copy. The sessions remain a blur for me, and all I can really say with certainty now about them is that I was sampling a vinyl box set of Mantovani material primarily, echoing the orchestral sampling present on High Hawaiian Fog, although the provenance for those tracks varied from Delius and Dvorak to Lee Hazlewood, far less singular and far more experimental on a foundational level. For Coastal Reveries, I wanted something that felt a bit more romantic, 1960s exotica, and Mediterranean honeymoon eloping, rather than Atlantic/southern American nautical fantasy. \n\n\n\nThe latter still managed to inform the vantage point of the recordings, however, with all seven tracks named for shorelines in the Carolinas - my way of acknowledging that this entire thing was a vision of longing for and imagining those European waves and ports, channeling them more as a voyeuristic conjurer rather than a seasoned traveler. By the time I'd completed the recordings, I felt genuinely as if this was a Halifaxian album for lovers, a seafoamed score for beached dalliances beneath fluffy white clouds, no doubt filled with the harp-strums of Cupid...these Coastal Reveries would be manifest in both mythical love and animal lust. To accentuate this approach, I penned a modest amount of copy to accompany the record, which was more or less a prosaic scene of sex on the beach, albeit surrealistic and abstract in many of the same ways my writing remains today. \n\n\n\nAfter a few years, Fisher gave me his blessing to publicly release Coastal Reveries, and plans were made to issue it at Wil Ru Records in Portland, the very same label that brought High Hawaiian Fog to the wider world, but soon after this, WR fell out of the business of issuing new music, and Coastal Reveries was shelved indefinitely. Today, almost nine years later, Reveries has been remastered from the original session tapes, and given a beautiful new visual design by Eric Adrian Lee, a name many listeners will already be familiar with from his work on High Hawaiian Fog, Sun Cast, Summer's Parting Ways and many more albums that are immensely important to me for personal reasons. Eric is a master, perhaps even THE master, of depicting scenes of romance, both bawdy and pastoral, and conveying this oceanic longing through the lens of his lush visual compositions. Lee's design work for Reveries is the perfect companion to the music, and I hope my prose (reprinted on the inner gatefold) lends itself favorably to the listening experience also. \n\n\n\nSo, as part of my celebration of my 38th year on this mad Earth, where truth continues to be even more surrealistic than the fictions I summon, I am more than happy to offer you Coastal Reveries, another chapter in the subtropical odyssey I've apparently been writing, not endless, but certainly without an ending in sight or mind. This music would appeal to fans of High Hawaiian Fog, Ocean Lion, Tigress and Sun Cast, but also maintains distinct connections to recordings like Verdant Acre, My Earths and even more modern excursions like Dripping Earth and Silhouettes. Included with your purchase are both indexed and seamless presentations of the album, and following this release will be a few others that are Coastal Reveries-adjacent, from June onward. \n\n\n\n\"There's only one thing you can do with a girl like this. Walk naked into the sea together as the sun sets. Make love once... Then die.\"\n\n\n\n-Mick Travis, 1968",

      "about": "PHOTOSTASIS is an unexpected return to the form and function of STATIC PHYSICS, a 2013 double-album of CH excavations, which mined, repurposed and transfigured sounds from other CH and even Milieu sources. The two tracks presented here explore deep dub techno tangents that rearrange their sonic provenance at the molecular level, aided by the addition of some very Halifaxian sampler/monosynth/drum machine work. This is minimalist techno for the dusky ends of Summer days, a paean to the Golden Hour that may be enjoyed alongside a porch chair, a cold lager or a well-packed spliff. It moves, it doesn't - the music echoes the words printed on the labels, conveying a sense of blissful stillness.",

      "about": "Following the field-recording triptych Porch Hash Logbook, an exercise in acoustic minimalism and wordless diaries, I pursued a tangent of exploring the possible applications of these field recordings within the framework of dub music. Forming an ouroboros of sorts, these tracks transfigure the sound of THC-doused outdoors into smoky and syrupy deep techno.\n\n\n\nThe recordings were routed through various channels of my R-EW Audioholistics modular system, as well as the vocoder within the Arturia Microfreak and reverberation units such as the Alesis Quadraverb, the Pioneer SR-202W and the Lexicon Alex. Over and under these processing scenarios, I played a Korg ES-1 sampler, which handled basic drumkit and bassline duties, and the final summed mix was sent into a DAW with numerous automation and modulation envelopes, rhythmic gates and slicers and additional FX. Finally, live takes were recorded wherein I'd nudge and pull on the gates and tempo grid, setting into motion many interesting mutations of the source material.\n\n\n\nSonically, these pieces are influenced by early Vladislav Delay, many records in the Chain Reaction catalog, many of Rod Modell's records for Soma, Intrusion, wzrdryAV and JS Zeiter. They are deep and dubbed out compost, with sounds that will likely appeal to fans of Leaf Cloak, Pharmlands/Static Pharming and Verdant Acre.\n\n\n\nThese sessions were immediately followed by a subsequent session of more minimalistic reductions, which are being released separately with the appended label \"Porch Compost\" - to be issued on May 7.",

      "about": "Three tracks, sporadically manifesting from the ashes of another minimal techno session from years past (see: Growth Markers -  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/growth-markers-phase-six-rhythmic-processing-recontextualization  ), that in many ways provide a bridge to other peripheral projects (such as Bike or even Vhom) as well as opening a new path forward for CH to explore. Inspired heavily by the minimalist techno of Mika Vainio / Ø, early SND, the first Sistol album, Thomas Brinkmann, LP5-era AE, Torsten Profrock and modern-era Omit recordings, CVX3 represents the typically glacial metabolic development of a longform CH album, redressed in sounds and events that are much more micro than macro, pointillist and welcoming of spaces and pauses, while still completely embracing of gridded rhythmic dynamism. CVX3 expresses many of these things while also managing to resemble almost nothing from the mainstream CH catalog, save for Deep Earth recordings, which these may very well owe the entirety of their structural makeup to. Greyscale electronic isolationism for minds looking to be momentarily erased.",

      "about": "AURORAL PHASES consists of two beatless pieces that manifested peripherally during the SILHOUETTES sessions earlier in the Summer. They reflect both the atmospheric texture of SILHOUETTES and the melodic provenance of STATUETTES, the latter being transfigured through my generative process to create the former. These two recordings were included only on a strictly limited edition of 8 copies (four numbered, and four 'artist print' copies) of the 12xCD-R deluxe boxed variant of SILHOUETTES II, and now that this edition is sold out, I felt it was only fair to make AURORAL PHASES available publicly, since I am never interested in deliberately keeping material hard to obtain. Musically, they are deeply calming pieces that I find work well on their own, outside of being appended to SILHOUETTES, and recall aspects of Milieu's ongoing VIBRATELEPATHOS series (((  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ))) in how they were created as well as their sonic personalities. \n\n\n\nNOTE: If you are one of the eight owners of the 12xCD-R SILHOUETTES II set, please only purchase this release if you absolutely must own it. I am planning, subsequent to the AURORAL PHASES release, to send all eight of you free download codes to add this release to your collections. Your continued support is appreciated.",

      "about": "SOFTWATER PINWHEEL is a four-track extended play, plucked from the archives and mastered for a proper release. Four versions of the same piece, initially created using a Yamaha QY-70 in tandem with several other key pieces of hardware, including Korg ER-1 and Boss DR-550/660 drum machines, the Korg ES-1 sampler and a small array of Volca synthesizers, such as the Keys analog polysynth (which I no longer possess) and the Bass analog mono. Altogether, SOFTWATER recalls extended singles such as MARAIS, JEL GUN and aspects of the ANALOG BOTANY series. It conveys a subdued atmosphere of dub chords and spaced-out synth accompaniment over heavy subharmonic bass and rhythms that alternate between a Voigt-esque schaffel and a more precise minimal techno attitude. The first two tracks were recorded in January 2016, in the Botany Bay studio, while the third and fourth tracks were alternate approaches to the same pieces, laid to tape in 2017 after relocating to the White Pillar Workshop in Ohio. Special thanks is owed to Atoll Intercom Systems, who not only designed the beautiful and evocative cover image used here, but also assisted in the arrangement and final sequencing of this release.",

      "about": "This album contains eight versions of material from the concurrent Milieu album Memory Maker, which offers up a new and unique audio format on clear plastic disks. The album was conceived and recorded entirely within the dream-state and projected telepathically onto the clear disks in realtime. When the decision was made to remix this strange audio, some transfiguration was necessary in order to facilitate a truly clear and deep CH sound, resulting in the manifestation of these equally mystical black plastic disks. The pandemic has made the world an increasingly strange place to live and make music in, so it follows that the impulses and ideas uncovered while asleep in that world would be just as alien and unfamiliar.

      "about": "Premiering on the Deep Breakfast podcast series in Italy (  soundcloud.com/deepbreakfastseries/deep-breakfast-054-coppice-halifax  ) are new longform recordings by Coppice Halifax, for/from a series of works titled Halifaxian Cantos. As the title might imply, these pieces represent the wordless prose of the Halifaxian continent, intimate and minimalistic devotionals sung to the seasons, the sea and the stars beyond them. Coppice Halifax has long maintained an ethos of acting as Aquarius the water-bearer, bringing forth decorative vessels of elemental splendor for both sustenance and reflection, and these Cantos have taken shape via this same approach, using a near-generative process that deifies and transmutes orchestral provenance into the almost infinite. A microcosmic study in ambient techno, drone music and process-driven synthesis, Halifaxian Cantos further explore and christen the unmapped lands of the Halifaxian landscape, offering a recorded output that is both tranquil and evocative in their wake. Longtime CH listeners will appreciate noticeable references to Verdant Acre, Reflector, Ferrolog, Dripping Earth and the now-numerous Arborist's Excavations in these works. \n\n\n\nN.B. (3/3/21): This third volume of the Cantos continues the path charted by the first two, and in some ways, diverges a bit into Wagnerian abyssals that feel at times excessively dark and, only moments later, triumphant and beautiful. This may yet be a more divisive volume of the series, but much like things such as Verdant Acre or Dripping Earth before it, Halifaxian Cantos reflects the asymmetry and organic dissonance commonly found in the natural world, by using a process that attempts to transfigure existing compositions from Bach with a human touch, somewhere buried beneath all of the automation and generative effects. What this means is that, at a molecular level, all of the joy, the sadness and everything in between that exists within Bach's work is here amplified and elongated considerably, to be illustrated by massively deep trenches of isolation and depression, and unfathomably high peaks of white mountaintops kissed by sunshine, and titanic waves that carry us back and forth between the two on the currents of time and space.",

      "about": "Winter is a severe season, at least much more so than it was (or wasn't at all) in the subtropics of South Carolina. I often feel as if I've inherited the seasons themselves, living here in Ohio, and snow falling never fails to make me feel like I'm living in a fantasy world. Reeling from the joy of looking out of my windows and seeing blankets of white, I took the occasion to jam out some equally joyous and frenetic Halifaxian dance tracks. These two pieces manifested as Winter Arch and White Drum, and felt like the Winter answer to Autumn's Ferine Alembix, in how raw and huge they came out on the tape. They were a lot of fun, start to finish, and I didn't want to obsess too heavily over them, preferring instead to simply fire them off for Bandcamp Friday, mixer to table, smoke em if you've got em. These are electric and alive sessions, and hopefully convey some of the pent-up energy and excitement that I've been saving for live performances that could presumably happen after the pandemic recedes, and like Ferine Alembix, the grittiness and compressor-abuse present in these mixes recalls a very classic Coppice Halifax aesthetic, one I feel completely comfortable with whenever the occasion permits it. If there's been one good thing about staying inside for so long with this pandemic going around, it is that I have been justified in falling down my own creative rabbit hole even further, by virtue of having nowhere else to go anyway...so setting up elaborate roller coaster rides like these just to zoom through them over and over again all by myself isn't so much a depressing prospect as an immensely enthralling one. As my wife is often fond of quoting: \"Can't go mad, ain't got time\"",

      "about": "DUSTY ACRE offers up two Halifaxian reconstitutions of source material from Milieu's A DUSTY BOX OF OLD MEMORIES album, arranged during the remastering process in July of 2015. These pieces, not entirely distant or dissimilar to things like VERDANT ACRE or URCEOLATMOSPHERION, recall the tape-bleached Casio palette used on the original Milieu recordings, juxtaposed against a mutant-parametric drum kit and bassline, generated using various loopers and low-bit samplers at the time. Overgrown and wildly tangential, these sessions will appeal to fans of albums like A BLUE FUME, CORNUCOPIAD or ELUVIAN II. \n\n\n\nNOTE: For listeners looking to hear the entire remastered A DUSTY BOX OF OLD MEMORIES album, these two mixes are appended as a second disc in the limited edition 2xCD-R set, available at the Milieu page:  milieumusic.bandcamp.com/album/a-dusty-box-of-old-memories-expanded-remastered",

      "about": "Improvised and broadcast live on Twitch on the evening of February 15th, 2018, this final entry in the White Pillar series was originally shelved for possible release at another label, but given the circumstances of 2020 and the general landscape of many label operations right now, I've decided to just issue White Pillar X here. \n\n\n\nThe entirety of the White Pillar sessions were informal and improvisational recordings that were designed for learning, growing, observing and adjusting to a new physical space after I relocated from the Botany Bay studio in the subtropics, to the titular new basement space in October of 2016. Six-hundred miles of distance, changes in barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed and elevation all factored into the music I'd make here, as did the new organizational workflow of having two six-foot long table tops to spread out all of my machines. It was nice to have a series of sessions that were only ever intended to explore the new spaces a bit, without any concerns over commercial viability or relationships to prior works, and somewhat ironically, the recordings themselves manifested as very cohesive dub techno pieces, a clear through-line able to be traced from WPW000 to WPW010 here. \n\n\n\nSonically, there is a lot of analog synthesis and processing happening, with splashes of digital FX and some PCM drum sampling. You can hear a lot of my favorite romplers like the Boss DR-660 and Yamaha RY-20 taking precedence, as well as machines I did not possess until I relocated and had more tabletop space to use, such as the Korg MS-20 and Grass C-TCM. Everything is sequenced on the machines' internal sequencers themselves, no external MIDI brains or computer involvement whatsoever. For trainspotters who are interested in seeing the live session, the broadcast was captured and archived here:  youtu.be/iJ0DAGS4WD8\n\n\n\n Looking back on this session now, I find it immensely interesting, as the White Pillar studio has since evolved and rearranged itself several times over since it was generated. I enjoy a lot of the funky moments and I love hearing the Korg Volca Keys in a few lead moments, as this unit later burned out in an electrical storm and has not been replaced. White Pillar X is a solid dub techno monument in the CH continent, and a fitting end to the long-running series. \n\n\n\n**NOTE: In addition to White Pillar X being issued solo, I've assembled a 6xCD collector's edition box set that compiles all eleven WPW catalog releases, plus several alternative mixes and three previously unreleased takes. You can check that out here:",

      "about": "In celebration of the reissue of 2008's long out of print drone-triptych POROUS VARIATIONS, I've revisited the session tapes and used some modern-age Halifaxian alchemy to render the woodsy resonations and monolithic bass down into so many grains of glittering sand that wash up on a familiar shore. Primarily sampling the POROUS VARIATIONS cut 'Sequoian', I felt compelled to process these old growths into sturdy stained boards, reassembled into a vessel that sets out to sea after the advancing ocean tide begins to subtract a little too much from the landscape. If none of this makes any sense, I can only apologize, because it all feels perfectly aligned in my mind's eye. Coppice Halifax as a project, even as a name, has always been meant to invoke the most vivid elements from oceanic and forestial locations, and something about working with POROUS VARIATIONS again felt very connected to that initial ethos. As you listen to this huge session, it should slowly become apparent that the towering trees and green canopies eventually and inevitably give way to rising sea levels, humidities, salty sunbeams rippling across bow and broken wave. It begins in the deep woods and ends adrift somewhere in the Atlantic. A truly liminal piece of work that could only ever exist between the two very different worlds of my work as Coppice Halifax, and my work under my birthname.\n\n\n\n**NOTE: For listeners unfamiliar with the massive POROUS VARIATIONS album who wish to take the full trip, a special ltd. edition 4xCD-R box set, which includes this deep mix, awaits you here:  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/porous-variations-expanded-remastered",

      "about": "Another year, another series, another branch in the long path of exploring my creative continents. 2021 brings us to ASTRAL SALONS, a nine-section series of monthly EP installments that land somewhere between STATIC PHARMING and SILHOUETTES, bridging the corporeal and the cosmic in concise twenty-minute jaunts that are designed to groove and meander in equal measure, and hopefully do not overstay their welcome. The digital 4x12\" FERINE ALEMBIX could be seen as a precursor for this series, as those sessions put me back in the mood to produce an EP series again, and further, ASTRAL SALONS are not just informed by their more \"modest\" runtimes, but also a very fresh and unique approach to modulation, stereo panning and sonic depth-of-field that I've played with in the past, but haven't yet focused so completely upon until now. \n\n\n\nPaired with these sessions are nine Polaroids shot using expired film, on the day of the August 21st, 2017 total solar eclipse. I felt that these images were appropriate analogs for the concept of the series, being surrealist and psychedelic multi-layered pieces with deliberately lossy artifacting, overexposed processing and overlaps of FX processes in motion that leave \"holes\" in the sound field. The photographs are presented as they were developed, with only some contrasting and digital cleanup work done in post, again mirroring my studio process for the ASTRAL SALONS sessions.",

      "about": "After relocating my studio from Botany Bay in the subtropics of central South Carolina to a chilly basement nestled in a wind-swept Ohio valley, a decision was made (partially out of necessity) to create a path forward in the new space, christening it as I went, with recordings that were designed to explore the room, the new configuration of hardware, the possibilities in workflow and of course observe the myriad of ways that my creative impulses could be affected by differences in elevation, temperature, barometric pressure and humidity. \n\n\n\nIn South Carolina, there is only ever one season - an endless Summer, a green Hell - but arriving in Ohio, it was immediately and abundantly clear how different everything felt. There was breeze, almost constantly, the grass was a finer texture than the severe jungle-blades in the south, and the seasons had phases that were pronounced and defined. Additionally, my new space was within relative proximity to things like NASA Glenn, the Serpent Mound and Wright-Patterson AFB (where they supposedly moved the Area 51 crash debris), and with my Deep Earth series already underway, it was suddenly within reach and consideration to commune with these things by way of radio bands and an invisible feeling in the air that was newness itself.\n\n\n\nAlthough the White Pillar sessions were initially drafted as a somewhat experimental offshoot of Deep Earth, intended to be even more free-form than those recordings, existing only to serve the new studio space first and foremost, to highlight whatever strengths and weaknesses needed to now be accounted for, it soon became obvious to me that the studio's namesake catalog would be a cogent sound, singular and defined from moment to moment. In this way, it succeeded far beyond any of my preconceptions in presenting the shape of things to come. \n\n\n\nSonically, the White Pillar sessions utilize a lot of live AM radio band reception, channeled through a number of FX devices both analog and digital, alongside improvisations conducted on a wide array of hardware, from analog synthesizers like the Arturia Microbrute and Korg MS-20 to digital rompler rhythm machines like the Boss DR-660 and Yamaha RY-20. More unique textural things entered the fray also, such as a fetal doppler, piezoelectric microphones attached to pipes in the basement's ceiling, walkie-talkie transmissions from my daughter's bedroom two floors above and even my then-recently acquired Grass Click-Tone Control Module, a piece of medical equipment that I repurposed into a tone generator. All of these things flowed into the veins of a Peavey FX2 24-channel mixing desk, christened \"King Stevie\" by none other than close friend and influence Stephen Hitchell (who was a guiding mentor in choosing the right mixer when I'd finally outgrown my Mackie), and manifested in deep shades of dub techno, ambient drifts, majestic hills and valleys of chord sweeps and thick, soil-caked rhythms. \n\n\n\nMany of these recordings not only served to outline what was possible in the new White Pillar studio space, but also presaged many of my generative processes and experiments that would go on to inform the assembly of my first modular system, the R-EW Audioholistics processing path. Listening back to the recordings now, I cannot think of a better method of breaking new ground in a new state, both mental and geographical, and I feel that the entire project holds together in extremely cohesive and enjoyable ways. \n\n\n\nThis collection totals almost seven hours of material, and includes all ten numbered entries in the WPW catalog, the precursor EP WPW000, four alternative takes and three previously unreleased \"Triadics\" of Pillar Ø. Thirty tracks laid across six discs for a highly immersive experience.",

      "about": "As the outwardly expanding DEEP EARTH series soon enters its sixth consecutive year, I felt it was pertinent to look back and reorganize some of the earlier material into an accessible and affordable entry point for the series. The musical content of DEEP EARTH has always been leaning toward the experimental, but with feet mostly planted in the minimal techno and ambient worlds that Coppice Halifax tends to explore. As such, any of the first three years of DEEP EARTH are as appropriate to begin with, and that is why I will be offering these URTH REDUX assemblages. Each volume of URTH REDUX contains all twelve monthly installments of one year long leg of DEEP EARTH. Streamlined, efficient, free of any bonus outtakes or peripheral explorations or alternative realities bleeding through - this is DEEP EARTH distilled and concentrated, and packaged in a collectible set that will not break the bank. Each URTH REDUX set comes banded together as twelve separate discs in white jackets with title stickers on the front, and sometimes including the \"secret messages\" from first editions of these releases on the back, all held snugly together between two thick square matboard panels that are labeled and ink stamped. A huge amount of material, priced at a large discount, and offered without the need to subscribe to the full series.\n\n\n\nFor more information about DEEP EARTH as well as the perks of subscriptions:  malfokusita.bandcamp.com",

      "about": "SACRAL PHASES consists of two beatless pieces that manifested peripherally during the SILHOUETTES sessions earlier in the Summer. They reflect both the atmospheric texture of SILHOUETTES and the melodic provenance of STATUETTES, the latter being transfigured through my generative process to create the former. These two recordings were included only on a strictly limited edition of 8 copies (four numbered, and four 'artist print' copies) of the 12xCD-R deluxe boxed variant of SILHOUETTES, and now that this edition is sold out, I felt it was only fair to make SACRAL PHASES available publicly, since I am never interested in deliberately keeping material hard to obtain. Musically, they are deeply calming pieces that I find work well on their own, outside of being appended to SILHOUETTES, and recall aspects of Milieu's ongoing VIBRATELEPATHOS series (((  vibratelepathos.bandcamp.com  ))) in how they were created as well as their sonic personalities. \n\n\n\nNOTE: If you are one of the eight owners of the 12xCD-R SILHOUETTES set, please only purchase this release if you absolutely must own it. I am planning, subsequent to the SACRAL PHASES release, to send all eight of you free download codes to add this release to your collections. Your continued support is appreciated.",

      "about": "A deeply transfigurative excavation of my NOXIOUS VARIATIONS album, issued in 2009 under my birthname, rearranged here at the molecular level, from the skeletal, noisy and feedback-crusted experiments of the NOXIOUS sessions to a psychedelic evocation of a pastoral landscape, heavy with humidity and Southern sunlight. Primarily sourced from the NOXIOUS piece 'At Forest's Edge, Water Laps Over The Rocks', this expansive reinterpretation goes through several phases of crumbling dub techno chords, long bent lines of something resembling a synthesizer lead and many different shades and amalgams of both, with all elements in some type of process or movement between poles for the duration. A vibrant piece of ambient techno that recalls many of the textural ideas that Coppice Halifax as a project was designed to explore, and a lush counterpoint to the wild and overgrown images of the natural world at play on NOXIOUS VARIATIONS.\n\n\n\n**NOTE: For listeners unfamiliar with the NOXIOUS VARIATIONS album who wish to take the full trip, a special ltd. edition 2xCD-R box set, which includes this deep mix, awaits you here:  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/noxious-variations-expanded-remastered",

      "about": "Following the publication of the first half of the expansive Silhouettes session in September, the second half arrives just in time to close the book on 2020. With another ten Umbral Phases, Silhouettes II continues and concludes the bridge built between Milieu's Statuettes recordings and the Halifaxian Cantos, and establishes a unique through-line between the two very different projects...although these sessions happened so easily and naturally that I do wonder how much I was \"establishing\" anything, instead merely illuminating something that was already there to begin with. \n\n\n\nLike the prior ten Phases, these variations mutate and transfigure only a few simple rhythmic and melodic elements into whole new soundworlds, recalling my work ethic on prior CH monuments such as Dripping Earth and Night's Moisture. Silhouettes is a deceptively minimal collection of sounds, and most if not all of the variance that can be observed between Phases is owed to the fact that each session's tonal content (minus a bass monosynth) is derived completely from the original tape masters for a different Statuettes piece. With those shapes aligned and established, the rest of the changes from Phase to Phase were topographical in nature - a BPM shift, a bass line that only ever fills in empty spaces, textural alterations on drum parts and real-time modulation of certain effects processors. The result is, hopefully a set of recordings that feels complete and linear but also manages to offer diverse moods and atmospheric conditions. \n\n\n\nNOTE: As with the first Silhouettes set, there are two editions: A 10xCD-R bagged set which is a slightly larger run and priced more moderately, and a deluxe 12xCD-R boxed set that contains two additional sessions (Auroral Phase I & II) not present in other editions, with a shorter pressing run (a numbered set of four copies, and four more \"Artist's Proof\" copies for latecomers), offering a special option for collectors.",

FERINE ALEMBIX are sessions of burnt out elemental recall, doused in smoke, urgent crusts of Halifaxian tectonics thrust ever upward. What does this mean? What does anything ever mean? In the green face of the tree-lined valley I laugh and exhale and spit, Earth to Earth, returning, remembering, reconsidering. Fingers dirty with the thick resins of porch perspectives. A chair beside a window, looking out into the negotiated and acceptable overgrowths in a picturesque neighborhood street. For a moment, which could itself be many moments, years and universes zoomed in upon with the scrutin-eye of vaporized gods, the forest returns, blooms and leaves and stalks defiantly resistant of change and human hands, mocking and refuting the oblong vessels, orange inside like a candlelit coffin, welcoming you and I as guests in this great opened house. I laugh again, and make a joke, but neither of us can hear it as my words are swallowed up by a swirling, expanding breath of forestial celebration. Lungs full of wind, stars peeking out from behind clouds like some sea-sprayed beach above our heads. Another night, another dream, another alter to throw ourselves upon in wild delight. The curtains of evening are drawn across the landscape and beneath these canopies we melt, rendered down to sweet oils and quiet pigments, a vibrant pool of lucid navigation that we'll swim up to the surface of tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, barely remembering.",

      "about": "After the years of work that resulted in two volumes of ambient compositions called STATUETTES, the curiosity to explore these recordings at the molecular level became too much to resist, and several different tangential sessions took place wherein the Statuettes material was melted down and reprocessed through several digital and analog systems, generative modular paths and FX processors, and used in performative ways reminiscent of the HALIFAXIAN CANTOS recordings. Casting shadows from the objects and structures built on STATUETTES, these SILHOUETTES are new lands and weather systems that recall their far off provenance alongside a Korg ES-1 sampler, a Memphis Blue Beat drum machine and a Behringer MS-1 analog monosynth. \n\n\n\nThese recordings were originally drafted simply for the pleasure of doing them, to satisfy impulses and curiosities that naturally spring up around my work as I close in on completing different projects, but I've now decided to collect them, gloss them over with a nice cozy mastering pass and release them here in an effort to raise a bit of cash for a new modular synthesizer case, as I've already outgrown my first two cases. Due to this, SILHOUETTES will only be produced in a physical edition of 10 copies, unless/until more copies are necessary.\n\n\n\nNOTE: The special \"boxed\" edition of SILHOUETTES contains two additional discs of material - SACRAL PHASE I & II - sidereal recordings that were neither wholly separated from the recording process nor completely in line with the main \"phases\"",

FERINE ALEMBIX are sessions of burnt out elemental recall, doused in smoke, urgent crusts of Halifaxian tectonics thrust ever upward. What does this mean? What does anything ever mean? In the green face of the tree-lined valley I laugh and exhale and spit, Earth to Earth, returning, remembering, reconsidering. Fingers dirty with the thick resins of porch perspectives. A chair beside a window, looking out into the negotiated and acceptable overgrowths in a picturesque neighborhood street. For a moment, which could itself be many moments, years and universes zoomed in upon with the scrutin-eye of vaporized gods, the forest returns, blooms and leaves and stalks defiantly resistant of change and human hands, mocking and refuting the oblong vessels, orange inside like a candlelit coffin, welcoming you and I as guests in this great opened house. I laugh again, and make a joke, but neither of us can hear it as my words are swallowed up by a swirling, expanding breath of forestial celebration. Lungs full of wind, stars peeking out from behind clouds like some sea-sprayed beach above our heads. Another night, another dream, another alter to throw ourselves upon in wild delight. The curtains of evening are drawn across the landscape and beneath these canopies we melt, rendered down to sweet oils and quiet pigments, a vibrant pool of lucid navigation that we'll swim up to the surface of tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, barely remembering.",

      "about": "A Halifaxian transfiguration of \"Pagan Horn\" from my Diamond Tears On Slate album, produced and published under my birthname. This mix was drafted for the occasion of the 10th anniversary expanded reissue of DTOS, and is being made available digitally by itself for listeners who do not wish to buy a deluxe multi-disc edition in order to obtain a new CH recording. It was created using the original four-track session tapes from DTOS as the sole audio source, and is in alignment with the many prior CH remixes of Milieu and BG recordings, previously collected as Arborist's Excavations, that appear on the Arboreal Digest reissue catalog entries. \n\n\n\nTo purchase this mix, as well as the expanded DTOS album, on a 2xCD-R set, please visit the Brian Grainger Bandcamp page:  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-tears-on-slate-expanded-reissue",

Appearing here, and continuing the mutation of SILVERINE via their own unique approaches to my studio's sound palette, are...\n\n\n\nZWEI KREISE, previously known as AXS, providing the most counterpoint interpretation of the cut yet, recalling classic records from DIN, MAS and other early 00s imprints...\n\n\n\nSUBSTAK, reprising his appearance on the BLUESHADE MIXES, offering a beatless and serene view of the eroded keyboard melodies in the original, here isolated and beautifully undisturbed...\n\n\n\nTHEE WOLF CODE, aka MOSCA, rinsing the sample pack in a short but effective jungle mix, cleansing the palate with brute force...\n\n\n\nARBEE, mulching and modulating the source material via a custom-build modular synthesizer, which occasionally drips out plumes of inky sound, dubbed bass and a very restrained groove...\n\n\n\nDUSKLARK, aka FOREST SATELLITE, transfiguring the chords and bass of the original into something wholly his own, a wistful bus ride with rainy windows, while you miss someone you're far away from...\n\n\n\nCOPPICE HALIFAX, closing the curtain on the entire affair with a fifteen-minute bedroom carpeted mix that wouldn't be out of place on MILKWHITE PLASTIC GALAXY MAKER, Q TRAX or PINK/PLASTIC ACRE...\n\n\n\n...PROGRAM REPEATS ON SIDE ONE / BLUESHADE MIXES... \n\n\n\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/silverine-blueshade-mixes",

      "about": "SILVERINE came into existence in the same way things like RIVER TABLEAUX, RAFT, VALLEYFOAM and ICED WHITE did - drafted as sessions of deep techno destined for issuance at Cold Fiction's recurring Futur[e]cho compilation series. To date, CH has been a participant in all ten volumes of this series, and the tenth volume is what conjured SILVERINE from the dim lamps, cable nests and warm machines in the White Pillar Workshop earlier this year. \n\n\n\nThis release contains the full SILVERINE session, with all four of the progressively deeper and more mutated versions of the cut, filling out sixty-six minutes of dub techno that feels like it belongs somewhere in the spectrum of sound between VERDANT ACRE, URCEOLATMOSPHERION and LEAF CLOAK. Perceptive listeners will recognize certain production tricks and even palette selections that were utilized in the SILVERINE session, such as the \"burnt chord\" sound that originated with LEAF CLOAK. \n\n\n\nSUPPORT COLD FICTION'S COMPILATION HERE, WHICH INCLUDES MIX #1 OF SILVERINE:  cfmlabel.bandcamp.com/album/futur-e-cho-2020",

      "about": "AUDIOHOLISTICS was a live set that was performed on March 20, 2020, shortly after the pandemic began. It was intended to be a live event at a coffee shop in Yellow Springs, Ohio, but after public safety became a concern, the show was canceled and the decision was made to broadcast the set live on Twitch instead. \n\n\n\nSonically, the set was designed to be the live iteration of the style of CH recordings like MILKWHITE PLASTIC GALAXY MAKER and PINK/PLASTIC ACRE, with elements that focus on melodic braindance and ambient techno from the mid 1990s, with obvious reference points to things like Warp's Artificial Intelligence series or the early Rephlex catalog. In addition to this, there are still moments of a more \"modern\" CH sound, with aspects of dub techno (via the ANALOG BOTANY series or PAWLEYS ISLAND) present alongside some drone synthesis that recalls things like LEAF CLOAK or even STATIC PHYSICS. \n\n\n\nAfter finishing the live set, the going idea was to stash the recordings in favor of sitting down for a few proper studio sessions and building out individual tracks using many of the sections, to perhaps assemble a full album with them. As time went on, however, and I revisited the recordings of the set itself (and two rehearsals that were also recorded), I discovered that I much preferred these sections of melody and groove in their momentary development, within the momentum of the live set itself, rather than as isolated compositions. They felt more purposeful as part of the whole process and performance, so individualizing them felt unnecessary. \n\n\n\nSo I've finally sat down with these recordings and done my best to master them, which is always a challenge with translating live recordings from things that are designed to work in a live experience versus things that are meant to be studio creations. The full set from March 20th is included here, in both indexed (separated) form and as an unedited single file (which is available as a courtesy to paying supporters here), and this set is augmented by the presence of two earlier rehearsals, which themselves highlight how much of AUDIOHOLISTICS was pattern-based improvisation and not structured or planned. The first rehearsal was a room recording, informally made, so the audio quality is not optimal, but this recording was included here to give a better indication of what it sounded like as it happened in an acoustic space, and not too dissimilar from what it may have sounded like at the Yellow Springs coffee shop, if that were to have happened. The second rehearsal was recorded from Twitch, to test volume and bass levels in OBS (the software used to organize live streaming) and to make certain compensations after taking into consideration the compression and loss that inevitably occurs when you stream audio online. \n\n\n\nAll three sets are unique and similar in many ways, and work together to form a cohesive picture of both Coppice Halifax as a live action, and the small array of drum machines, samplers and synthesizers (dubbed the Microbotany rig) used to convey it.",

      "about": "Originally recorded at Botany Bay between 2012-2013, this extended and dubbed out version of Opal (from Pacific Opal Hex) found a small release in Autumn 2019 as a bonus disc with a limited edition of the 8xCD Deep Works retrospective box set. With the pandemic now sweeping the globe and digital audio taking precedence over physical ritual out of sheer necessity, I have decided to offer Opal (Droned) as a digital release in the name of accessibility. It comes at an apt moment, as the Pacific Opal Hex album is also finally available on the CH Bandcamp platform, so between these two releases, there are now two full hours plus of tropical dubby mid-tempo deep listening. Both the P.O.H. album and this version of Opal exist within the same universe as Ocean Lion, High Hawaiian Fog and Tigress, so for listeners who enjoy those recordings, this is a trip well worth taking.",

They truly embody the ethos of \"Compost, not composition\" and illustrate generative processing and synthesis concepts that result in brand new Halifaxian deep techno works, grown and built entirely from the provenance of my Anthelion recordings under my birthname. Everything you hear is resultant from the Anthelion source material, including the rhythms and bass tones, generated via careful equalization, filtering and pitch FX, where a complex system of moving parts transfigures incoming audio (either tonal or atonal) into these shapes and techno-oriented structures that play out across lengthy, immersive listening experiences. \n\n\n\nAs the Anthelion series of seasonally and elementally inspired recordings continues, so too will the Compost recordings that mutate that originating sound with alchemical magicks in the White Pillar Workshop. This is the first volume of what could be many more like it.",

      "about": "Originally recorded as a beatless and extended alternative mix of \"Equatorial Haze\" from High Hawaiian Fog, Arctic Liner Disintegration appeared briefly in physical form as a bonus 3\" mini-CDR included with preorders of the High Hawaiian Fog LP. Having also been subsequently included in the Collected Drone Works double-album compilation, this solo release is the first time it has appeared in its own time and space on Bandcamp. For the occasion, I sporadically decided to attempt a \"dub\" of the track using the original session tape alongside a sampler containing two drum breaks used on \"Equatorial Haze\" and a bass monosynth. The result of this session is \"Arctic Liner Dub\", a brand new perspective on the High Hawaiian Fog sound that seems to be informed a bit more by Tigress. Huge, deep and droned out, it pulls me back to the splashing waves and salty sand of those headspaces.",

      "about": "Finally, after several months of hard-drive scrubbing, USB card digging and master tape seeking, the Compleat edition of Year Four of the ongoing Deep Earth series has arrived. Expanded with five-hours-plus of previously unreleased material in the form of twenty-two brand new recordings, the full set totals 109 tracks across 22 discs - the largest year of Deep Earth thus far. As with prior years, this set orders all twelve public releases chronologically, followed by the twelve subscriber-only releases, and all of these discs are filled out and augmented by the unreleased material as it feels appropriate. Sonically, Deep Earth remains the embodiment of my unmapped and sometimes wildly untamed Halifaxian continent, the fringes and borderlands of the more mainstream and conventional music I usually release outside of the series. It exists as a perenially new concept, filled and fulfilled by the learning of new hardware and synthesis systems, constantly set into motion through improvisations, generative setups and FX-send fantasias, all laid to tape in a dimly lit basement studio. Material offered here ranges from monolithic dub techno, warm pools of ambient synthesizers, electrical drones, industrial noise, medical equipment repurposing, tape experiments, cozy blippy psychedelics and thrumming analog electronics. Deep Earth does not compromise, as is evident here in the length and breadth of the sounds, so I sincerely hope this tome of soundwaves, alien and unfamiliar as they may sometimes be, brings you weeks, months, years...lifetimes...of escapism through pure resonant vibration. \n\n\n\nLISTEN TO CLIPS OF ALL 22 PREVIOUSLY UNRELEASED TRACKS HERE:  soundcloud.com/coppice-halifax/deep-earth-year-four-compleat-unreleased-tracks-sampler\n\n\n\n *NOTE* The yearly subscription to Deep Earth is still currently $222, which nets you twelve subsequent months of everything that gets released in the series, and all four prior years of the series, including this one. Listeners who are curious about Deep Earth are encouraged to investigate subscriptions if they wish to get the most amount of music for their money.",

After moonlighting as a streamable exclusive for Mad Wasp Radio for a few months, the decision was made to offer it in full lossless quality, with proper album art and a limited physical edition. Musically, this set would appeal to fans of previous live CH broadcasts such as GREEN PHARMING, APPLEBLUE DRAM and VIBRAFOAM DUB. It was completely improvised using a number of modern and vintage hardware devices, and zero computers were involved in any step of the process besides the final mastering gloss. Deep, dubby and slow-burn music for the Summer months, even as the cool breezes of Autumn begin to slowly creep in...",

      "about": "FROM THE LABEL, 2011: \"Following in the wake of the oceanic surreal fantasy LP High Hawaiian Fog, Coppice Halifax has returned with an encore, of sorts, to HHF: Pacific Opal Hex. Taking its name from the vinyl-only track on High Hawaiian Fog, this album continues where HHF's closing piece \"Amstar Paradise\" leaves off. Starting with sparse washes of low-tide textures, glittering white noise and pillowy chords that swell and subside like silvery waves wiping the shore. Delay trails begin to accumulate and the textures become more humidified, covered in glistening tropical precipitation. A fullness of harmony emerges, and just when it feels as if the crescendo has finally hit its apex, a slow, warm bassline enters like a sun-bleached cruise liner sailing across a tranquil purple horizon line. A pulsing, erotic rhythm subtly forms and suddenly that far-off woodblock sound you thought was a rope tapping on a mast turns into a simple, stately beat. Five minutes turn into ten, and ten to twenty, as this endless orgasmic cloud continues to surf along in slo-mo on a psychedelic plateau of blue water and breeze. If seawater, nostalgia and endorphins could be distilled into a drug, it would bear the name Pacific Opal Hex, and be served in a snifter with a balloon of nitrous oxide on the side.\"\n\n\n\nFROM THE WR PROMO SHEET, 2011: \"After a long day shooting for his new film “Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key“, Italian movie star and fashion trendsetter Ivan Rassimov retreats to his on-set trailer. Ah, but this is not just a trailer – it is a luxury home away from home. Yes, Ivan can still enjoy Hungarian cognac and fine opera from the comfort of his Nitrous series living room set, designed by the reclusive E. A. Lee. Premier upholstery meets European craftsmanship to provide the most spacious and comfortable furniture available! Take it from Ivan: “The Nitrous is like style – you either have it, or you don’t”…\n\n\n\nOther testimonials:\n\n“So comfy, I bought two!” – Daria Nicolodi\n\n“I can’t believe it was only twenty bucks!” – John Saxon\n\n“When I sleep on the Nitrous couch I dream of golden guitars!” – Alessandro Alessandroni\n\n“Need a new sofa?

This includes the vinyl-only track \"Pacific Opal Hex\" and different mixes of \"Equatorial Haze\", \"Royal Purple Pageant\" and \"Amstar Paradise\" \n\n\n\nFrom the back cover of the LP: \"This record is not just a record, it is a porthole to another dimension. Glossy black spirals sing like sirens and lull you into a zero-gravity coma. Swirling strings, dusty organs and sun-warmed bass melt into a haze of foamy waves and blue skies. As you soak up the tropical radiation, you find yourself on an endless beach, with a cruise ship sinking slowly on the purple horizon. The sun too becomes swallowed into the permanent blue sea like a golden egg, giving way to hundreds of pinholes in the velvety black sky above you. Wind softly blows through palm tress in the distance, and the droning repetitions of low tide begin to wrap around you. Your heartbeat becomes a muted kickdrum, reverbs trail off, and beat by beat, you are returned to your comfy bedroom. Were you really here, all that time? Put the needle down, one more time, just to find out...\" \n\n\n\nFrom the WR press release: \"Roll out the red carpet, all the way down to the bottom of the sea, for the first Coppice Halifax album ever laid to the vinyl format, High Hawaiian Fog. Six dense constructions of seawater and sand, etched into two black sides, recalling influences such as GAS, Casino Versus Japan, The Caretaker and even Brian’s work as Milieu. Soaking wet reverbs gloss softly over creaking, rusty chords that bend and sway beneath the compressed pressure of an airtight bass drum. Light flecks across the surfaces like glitter and textures dance and play inside the slow-motion underwater beauty pageant for mermen and maids on opiates. This is womblike psychedelic techno made by scraping the bones of Stravinsky, Satie, Mussorgsky, Smetana, Debussy and Delius across drum machines on a plush carpeted dancehall, long since overgrown and forgotten by the sea on a silent cruise liner’s wreckage. Sunny and sad music for your hi-fi and subconscious.\"",

      "about": "Geographically, POST PROCESS exists in the previously untraveled space between VAPOROUS POST (itself a transfiguration of DRIPPING EARTH) and overgrown dub monoliths like VERDANT ACRE and URCEOLATMOSPHERION. It consists of eight mixes built using \"partials\" from the ANTHELION sessions (partials are my personal slang for sound files and other processing elements that are singular pieces intended for a specific role in the mixing of a larger piece), with many different types of multilayered FX wash and pitch/pan mulching, cast against a drum machine (Korg DS-10), a sampler (Korg ES-1) and a bass monosynth (Korg Volca Kick). In the generatively-sporadic spirit of recordings like NEPENTHESOL and PHYLLEX, POST PROCESS illustrates an almost careless freedom with sound-as-sandbox, focusing on a solid bass and rhythm groove that the rest of the tonal elements must bend around. \n\n\n\nThe purpose of the entire session was simply to see what might happen if these ANTHELION partials were able to be utilized in a more musical capacity, and once the first couple tracks were underway, the organic and sometimes swampy voice of POST PROCESS began to proliferate like moss and mushrooms around dead oak trees. POST PROCESS is presented as a dub techno album that does not really ascribe to most of the hallmarks of dub or techno music - rather, the dub manifests via the presence of spring reverb boxes, tape hiss, multigenerational loss from sounds that have been overdubbed and overdubbed again, and the fact that in a skeletal sense, all eight cuts are versions of the same piece of music. \n\n\n\nThese recordings are recommended for fans of Coppice Halifax's heavier dub recordings, as well as listeners interested in hearing a parallel path to certain parts of the Deep Earth series.",

      "about": "DEEPWOODS MIXTURE is a live set of Halifaxian composted techno, mulched together from various different releases and tape sessions into a singular, pulsing entity, similar in approach to COMPOSTING TECHNIQUES FOR MORE FRUITFUL GARDENING, although a bit more in the 4/4 techno department. Originally, this session was laid to tape at the invitation of the Deep Breakfast podcast series in Italy, but until now it has been unavailable in lossless quality, or on any physical edition. Listeners are encouraged to explore the DEEPWOODS MIXTURE in a variety of settings, from headphones, to bedtime, from cruising in a car to sitting on a porch. Substance-enhanced, but never derived, 100% pure. Does what it says on the tin.",

      "about": "My Earths is a Coppice Halifax recording that has been referred to and rumored for about six years now, with an edit of the track \"Eroded Visage\" appearing on the Vaporized Forest Index 10th anniversary CH compilation, out of time and context. It was scheduled for release at two different labels outside of Milieu Music, and neither plan materialized. Finally, it now arrives as a weathered artifact from the past, which still manages to feel modern and unique among the current crop of Halifaxian farming, and the implied apocalyptic tone present beneath much of the material, titles and visuals weighs heavily on me as I type this, shuttered away in my basement, fearful of the future. \n\n\n\nStill, My Earths conveys a detached kind of voyeurism and escapist fantasy, populated by the perspective of an interloper who passed through our world on their way to somewhere further out - the impressions they would have with such an experience, experiencing humanity from behind a window, all our histories and romances evaporated by some unknown event, reduced to cracked recordings and burnt books, stone ruins swallowed up by overgrown environments, everything reclaimed and recycled - the entropy of cosmic compost. All of these images are things I've perhaps come to terms with as I've aged as an artist, the idea that your sentiment betrays the longevity and agelessness that you want creative work to have, and when you go back to that acre where it all looked so picturesque and inspiring a decade ago, your memory's erosion becomes clear, the lie of nostalgia becomes sour and you must accept past moments as the buried objects that they are.\n\n\n\nAnd so that is what I attempt to illustrate here: An imperialistic claim of ownership on my remote and unreachable memorials of myself and my view of the world, an acceptance of the things I've tried to say, the ways I've tried to say them, being muddled and worn down by what comes after, and how it feels as if these decisions came not from me, but from another life lived in another place entirely, not just a difference in time but also in dimension. They are all still here, trailing echoes of footprints treading through a Carolinian dirt road. My Earths, seen from the vantage point of superposition, where they all exist and they've all moved on and they will all spin on their looped axes until comets and collisions smooth them down to a pale marble, a bone-white heart, a grain of sand...pulled into the ebbing tide of the void and washed up on the edge of another shore, on another island, in another sea. \n\n\n\nThe four recordings offered here are filled with representations of these things...the white noise of the sea, the grit and grain of tape detritus, the beating heart of kick drum and bass pulse, the wordless and melancholic whale song transfigured into subconscious opera. Four paintings of the Halifaxian pathos, dashed upon a white pillar that was once a part of another great work, now drifting in an empty landscape, left for someone else to discover.",

      "about": "FROM THE LABEL, 2011: \"Coppice Halifax's Vapor Acre features nearly 80 minutes of dense hypnotic dub-techno bathed in warm synth washes and cool field recordings. A sound-scape ideal for spaced out extended relaxation. Also featuring two massive remixes by Ndru and Radere.\" \n\n\n\nFROM THE ARTIST, 2020: \"Vapor Acre is a collection of tracks that were somewhat tangential explorations recorded after the Analog Botany series and Pawleys Island sessions came to a close. At the time, I was using \"acre\" as a shorthand descriptor for the process and structure of these recordings, much like bluesmen used the word \"blues\" or rave music used the term \"acid.\" Each Acre offered a view of a place and time, usually influenced by temperature and elemental forces, and other tracks laid to tape within this ethos were issued on split releases with Ohrwert and Axs at the time. Thematically, I was also conscious of these pieces' relation to (and differentiation from) Verdant Acre, which was being recorded at the same moment in time. \n\n\n\nAs these tracks were recorded at the very end of my time in the Rolling Knoll studio, a small CD-R was released containing five of them, sent out as a bonus promotional item with orders shipped from Milieu Music at the time. The WR cassette release expanded Vapor Acre to six original tracks, augmented by two new extended remixes by Ndru and Radere (the latter of whom I released a split CD-R with titled ABX2 in 2009). The first edition of the tape went out of print, and a second edition with different colored labels shipped with a bonus digital download of \"VSS Acre\", the only cut in this set recorded at Botany Bay. All nine tracks have been assembled here, and stand solidly as a monument that exists somewhere between Analog Botany, Leaf Cloak and Verdant Acre.\"",

      "about": "While going through tapes, thumb drives and old masters looking for other unrelated things, new cultivars are sometimes intermittently discovered. (Some hills are never seen). This half-hour deep Pharming-class cut is such an excursion, an unexpected but illuminating Coppice Halifax live techno treatment of the Milieu cut \"Evapour\" from the Daughter album. While the original track was built using a combination of FM synthesis and analog filtering/EQ, this take composts the source audio through the usual CH machinations and sends it in a completely different direction, with the addition of multiple drum machines, a bass monosynth and a Roland SH-32 playing those dripping cloud chord sequences. A bit of unexpected feelgood, at a time when I (and likely you) could use it the most. If you can't go out for some sunshine, then Coppice Halifax will bring the sunshine to you.",

      "about": "FILTERED ARTIFACTS III collects twelve alternative variants of CH tracks, originally issued across the final twelve volumes of the VALLEY FILTER sampler series (#25-36), which were distributed in the form of Bandcamp codes included inside physical orders during the 2019 year. These recordings are, like the first two volumes of FILTERED ARTIFACTS, specifically arranged to follow an album-like narrative, despite their backgrounds coming from multiple different sessions and equipment setups. As with many of the CH reworks/reconstitutions, these pieces may not even outwardly resemble their namesake tracks, offering a new perspective on many of the albums and EPs in the CH back catalog. Further expanding and canonizing this compilation are two previously unreleased tracks - dream-composted versions of Appleblue Dram and Autumn Contrast, respectively - bringing ARTIFACTS III up to an impressive 2.5 hour runtime. Fourteen cuts that are equal parts deep techno, analog experimentation, tape-crusted textures and disconnected melodic bliss, perfect for the advent of a new and vibrant Spring season.",

      "about": "In the latter half of 2019, a talented Finnish painter privately commissioned me to write and record an album that sounded like \"High Hawaiian Fog at sunset\" alongside a few other particular reference points, such as the Ocean Lion recordings. Tigress, a two-hour double-album, is what followed in the last months of the year, keeping me warm in the studio as the temperatures outside went from cool to colder and the leaves fell beneath the weight of Winter rainfall. I finally finished the work in January, and at the request of the patron whose support and initiative willed it into existence, I am issuing it publicly as well. Sonically, Tigress resembles the wave-stained shorelines and sunken orchestras of albums like High Hawaiian Fog and Ocean Lion, but is also designed to be much more dynamic and dense, with many different moving parts that initially do not reveal themselves in the sun-coated sea wash of melodic haze. Sun Cast, Swaying Palms and Pawleys Island are all close enough to be felt, if not heard, as well. \n\n\n\nIndeed, the ship has left port, the tide has come rushing back in, bringing with it artifacts from tragic wrecks and merfolk magicks hidden inside colorful shells, as the sun finally sets upon an orange sand island, and we stand beneath the gradually inkstained sky, hand in hand, watching the light sink beneath the surface, claimed once more by the longing of seafoam ghosts and beautiful sirens, dowsing the light in a thousand salty tears, dispersing it as glitter-crested waves that gently crash upon our knees. You and I both know there's never any going back, that nothing can ever be the sweet sameness of that oft-romanced before, that the swamp takes everything back eventually...but the rusting bells of memory call us just the same, heralding that hopeless search back to the softened lens of our nostalgic recall, chiming in perfect unison their distant hail, pulling us out onto the waves again like the lonesome sirens, for one more trip to those golden ruins beneath the empty sea.",

      "about": "I've been running creatively wild with the Deep Earth series (  malfokusita.bandcamp.com  ) for over four years now, and throughout January, I had several different sessions with different gear configurations in a sifting process to decide how I should begin Year Five of this tangential but uniquely presented series.\n\n\n\nThe third session, presented here, consisted of a prepared dictation-grade cassette using the Vesta Fire MR-10B (a British four-track tape machine from the mid-1980s) that assembled four different recordings of a Sangean shortwave radio tuned to 448hZ, each at a different pitch, modulated slightly by an under-powered Danelectro tremolo unit. This cassette was then routed through my more standardized FX array and Peavey mixer, alongside a Yamaha MR10 drum machine (itself processed by the Steiner-Parker filter in an Arturia Microbrute monosynth), and the four pitches of shortwave radio were \"played\" off the tape machine like a four-voice synthesizer. Five different sessions like this came to pass, each one with the cassette played back either forward or reverse, with or without the machine's onboard dbx noise reduction activated (which itself acts as a sort of low-pass filter). The fifth and final session ended up beatless, and became VARMO, the 49th Deep Earth catalog release and the opening recording of the series' fifth year. \n\n\n\nThese first four mixes, under normal circumstances, would have likely been shelved until 2021, when assembly work would begin for the \"Compleat\" box set of Deep Earth: Year Five, but considering that these mixes alone would amount to another four discs of any set, I decided to isolate them and issue them here, outside of the Deep Earth series. This release is not the first time this has happened, with Deep Earth session recordings ending up outside the series with MARAIS and certain parts of the SOUTH SENTRAL POSITRONIX album, as well as the ACCUMULATION DUBS record. It provides an interesting outer counterpoint to the series, which is often very insular and monochromatic, set clearly apart from the rest of the Milieu Music catalog, which is often more varied and colorful. \n\n\n\nMusically, WARM EARTH VARIATIONS resemble recordings like REFLECTOR, WINTER BLURRING and MONUMENT, and display specific influences of mine such as GAS, Variant and Deepchord, while somehow sounding like none of them in this particular instance. 3.5 hours of longform deep listening with a beat.",

      "about": "Slow Earth Ritual is a confluence of many different tributaries, running through the Halifaxian continent. It celebrates the hundredth release in the ABX subcatalog of post-Analog Botany recordings. It revisits, in sonic and photographic terms, the winding and tangential paths of Verdant Acre. It returns to the invocation of oceanic and forestial elements in the Coppice Halifax name itself. It is the culmination of a collaborative process with a close friend, confidante and longtime influence on the CH output, Stephen Hitchell of Echospace. \n\n\n\nWith this release, Stephen and I agreed to start with the aural compost of the Verdant Acre series - a dense ambient techno monolith replete with shades of GAS, Pole, The Caretaker, Andrew Deutsch, Rod Modell and of course Hitchell himself. We met each other in the Acre, across foggy time and midwestern space, and it all felt like we'd been there before, somehow. Using his Variant vessel (which I've done two extensive remixes for in recent years) Hitchell brought the falling stars and cosmic cultivars with him to my sentimental estate. For my part, I excavated a surreal structure from deep under the black forest dirt, an Earthen temple fashioned from igneous stone, petrified wood and the bones of long perished woolly mammoths.\n\n\n\nTogether, we transfigured the past into something that is not the past, the present or the future. Music that feels familiar, yet exists outside of time, suspending itself in an endless oscillation of vibration and rhythmic pulse. Unearthing these artifacts from past explorations with Variant is both an honor and a pleasure. It is worthy work that I feel will yield fruitful listening (and potentially subsequent crops) for years to come. Hitchell has unified the ocean of (Echo)space with my deification of unmapped vaporized forestry, both of us plunging lethargic and reckless into the frontier's long night. Slow Earth Ritual canonizes his creative work as a part of my own, and returns me to my own native soil in the process.",

      "about": "A comprehensive collection of all twelve EPs from the 2009 Analog Botany series. Over four hours of melodic, organic ambient and dub techno, inspired by pioneers such as Basic Channel, DeepChord, Monolake, Wolfgang Voigt and Plastikman, among others. This series was the first step outside of the \"traditional\" CH sound, which was established in 2006 as a Milieu side-project for ambient techno with an emphasis on textural experimentation and spacious, analog atmospherics. While the earlier works sounded more degraded, covered in tape hiss and compressors, the AB series presented a cleaner, glossier CH, focusing still on textures and analog sounds, but bringing a tight low end and rhythmic element that wouldn't be out of place on a dancefloor. Since the completion of this series, Coppice Halifax has gone on to release several EPs in the \"Botanical\" vein, as well as appearing on splits with Radere, CN, The House In The Woods, Axs and Ohrwert.",

      "about": "PHARMLANDS is a set of twelve CH live cuts, each nearly a half-hour in length, that revisit the STATIC PHARMING series by way of transfiguring source synthesis from the fourth year of my WORKINGMAN'S DRONE series alongside a bass monosynth, a couple drum machines and a slew of analog/digital FX processing. In a method of working that recalls DRIPPING EARTH and GREEN SHAPE, the sessions for PHARMLANDS are each a different shade/perspective/iteration/version of the same singular idea, ambient techno and dub ethos by way of near-generative synthesis and signal processing-as-composition. Collected here, they form a monolith in the Halifaxian landscape that is sure to appeal to longtime listeners as well as newcomers to the sound, being both abstracted and accessible in the same twelve breaths.",

Each loop is designed for seamless infinite repetitions, similar to a locked groove on a vinyl record, and playback is suggested on digital audio software (or some physical component systems) that enable track repeating without gaps. These loops are also ideal for those of you with interests in DJ mixing, as they are all ready to be dropped into programs such as Ableton Live and mixed/processed in endless variations. A very limited physical component of this release was issued earlier on, but is completely out of print now.",

      "about": "When I approached Axs to ask him to produce a remix for the Cedar Mast remix effort, I didn't expect him to enjoy mixing the source material to such a degree that he'd generate remixed versions of every song on the original album. Like me, Axs is a very prolific creator when he becomes fascinated with a sound or an idea, and so it only felt appropriate to section off these five remixes for a proper release. The interesting thing is that, when considered as a whole, Axs' five remixes present the source material in such a newly configured and colorful way that what we're hearing is essentially a new album, conceived in both the Coppice Halifax and Axs universes. It is not surprising, then, that Axs and I went on to work more closely on several other projects, all of which will hopefully be released in the coming months. For now, listeners can enjoy the stimulating sounds of Cedar Mast, re-tooled by Axs into a fantastic techno album with both dub and dancefloor influences.",

One-hundred percent of the sounds used to create these pieces came from Zander One's original track. These remixes were principally created live with various pieces of hardware, FX devices and computer, and laid to warm cassette tape. Cascading chord stabs and thin membranes of white noise succulently coat a field of round rhythmic forms. Globules of kick drum and sub bass coalesce with one another and counterpoint percussion is formed from the vaporous air itself.\n\n\n\nListen/download/buy Echoate by Zander One here: \n\nrecycledplastics.bandcamp.com/album/echoate/",

      "about": "Along with several other current and forthcoming Coppice Halifax releases, this split project with Submersion ushers in a fresh and unique approach to techno as a genre. Combining elements of heavy drones, field recordings and excessive analog processing with throbbing kick-drum rhythms, dense compression and dubby chord punctuations, Dilate/Erode is a massive exercise in deep sonic exploration and experimentation. Sometimes, as atonal as it is musical, meandering chords drift around icy textures and windy hums as a bass pulses metronomically like a heartbeat heard inside the womb. The two artists' contributions intertwine so seamlessly and naturally that one might be hard pressed to tell the difference without a tracklist, and special attention has been given to creating an immersive atmosphere over and under the songs using mutated field recordings by both artists. Presented in a very limited edition of just 50 copies, with the first 25 containing an exclusive second CD-R of the field recordings and atmospheres minus the music.",

      "about": "Cedar Mast is the result of an experiment undertaken during the Summer of 2012 at Botany Bay. Having a longtime fondness for video games, and by association, video gaming consoles of years past, it occurred to me how much I always loved the bootup/menu sounds made by the Sega Dreamcast system. My wife bought me a brand new system for my 29th birthday, since our old unit had long since died, and I took the opportunity to sample all of the native sounds the machine makes when there isn't a boot disc inside. As many of you familiar with the Dreamcast will know, these sounds consist of wet, chorus-laden bleeps and chord stabs, which seemed like the perfect ingredients for making techno tracks...and so Cedar Mast was conceived and subsequently created. Everything you hear in these five tracks that is not a drum machine (which is to say, all of the melodies, pads, basslines and even bits of percussion) has been created using only those original sounds from the Sega Dreamcast. \n\n\n\nThe concept of these recordings ended up proving quite accessible and interesting to a lot of other producers I know, so as I write this, a massive remix effort is already underway, and will be released within the year if all goes well.",

      "about": "Pulling from the provenance of the Sega Dreamcast's boot screen and menu sounds once again, eleven talented producers have contributed thirteen lovingly crafted remix works for the Cedar Mast remix album. To introduce and unveil the album, I've created a rebuild of my own, using the same source material samples that all eleven artists were tasked to use exclusively in creating these remixes. Musically, these tracks come in from all sides of the globe and contain very drastically different interpretations of the same source materials. \n\n\n\nLamont Kohner, a new pseudonym for Patrick Benolkin (aka Electricwest and Eluder), rinses out a plodding dark and slow techno atmosphere with ominous bass, which transitions beautifully to the contrasting dub techno sunshine of Textural Being's redo. Arbee and Tawdry Otter (aka Adrien75) both turned in two remixes, with Arbee's bearing his signature mutated bedroom electronic sound and Tawdry Otter opting for two flavors of swanky dub and dancefloor. Federsen hails from California with his completely analog-delay and vintage gear-constructed remake, and Dissolved transports a glowing irradiated lab specimen with perky beat programming from Vancouver. Mental Health Consumer keeps things short and sweet with one of the more modestly lengthed mixes of the collection, all bubbly and quaint. Optic_ drops in from the Netherlands with a blistering housey techno romper, giving way to Customer's disassemblage/reassemblage that brings to mind the loopy psychedelia of early Pub. Zzzzra imports his own special brand of French dub techno groove, and hands off the album's closer to Ocralab, who turns in the most minimal and alien remixes of the set. \n\n\n\nAltogether, the Cedar Mixes assemble to create a whole larger than the sum of their parts, and effectively a lovely mutation/meditation on the sounds of the Sega Dreamcast is brought to life.",

      "about": "C is a unique Coppice Halifax release that is somewhere between and EP and an album. It is something that, were the Milieu Music budget to allow it, would ideally be released on 12\" vinyl. Heavily inspired by psychedelic techno works by Dettinger and Jonas Bering in the early days of Kompakt, as well as newer synth-led music like Luke Abbott. C contains three tracks, which is no small coincidence considering my longtime fascination with threes and conceptual symmetries working their way into music. The music is a well seasoned blend of minimal grooves and textural pitter-patter anchoring a cloud cover of pads and chords that get so bright it almost sounds like a panic attack at times. There's also some nice thick arpy basslines and some unique rhythmic sounds that were created with samples of fireworks and rocks breaking beneath a hammer. A large emphasis has been placed on live mixing and micro-shifts in delay rates and saturations, flanging, panning and other processing, rather than compositional movements. \n\n\n\nAvailable only on a limited edition of 50 copies packaged in black or white cardboard jackets with red or white foam sticker covers.",

Zwei Kreise's \"Channelwood Distillation\" is a near half-hour of beautiful chord formations that slither around in a swamplike haze, anchored by a pulsing dub bassline and lightly painted over with some of ZK's own chilly electric piano melodies. The \"Stoneship Threshold\", built by Coppice Halifax, is perhaps as large and heavy as the title might indicate - massive pillars of impenetrable drones slowly expand and contract to reveal a flickering center of spattered delays and dubby organ stabs. The entire affair is over 76 minutes in length, making for some seriously deep listening. If Leaf Cloak was meant for the sunset, Mistmorning is meant for that still and silent time right before sunrise, when everything is calm and the world hasn't awoken yet.",

      "about": "As with all the seasons, none are complete without an atmospherically affected album at Milieu Music. Winter Blurring is exactly what the title indicates, and more - it is a longform construct of distilled cold and chilly dampness, melted down and rendered inert via warmth-generating rhythms and bass. Soft tints of orange and red crackles play at a screen of frozen chords and glassy drones, and the fuzz of fuzzy blankets gently covers up the drums, removing all corners and hard angles in favor of round eroded edges. Winter Blurring is also a literal crossover piece, taking a significant amount of its source sound from the final EP of this year's Workingman's Drone series, Ten Thousand Winters. As that series ends, and the new Static Pharming series begins, it only felt natural and appropriate to create a single bookend piece for both of them, making Winter Blurring just as much a drone piece as a dub techno one.",

This release is a special limited edition physical pressing of the two Coppice Halifax remix constructs for Ratio, a double fantasy of lush pads, airy open atmospheres, radiant drones and organic rhythms. Clocking in at a massive 32 minutes, Glacial Fortress is yet another example of just how deep the CH submersible is able to go these days, as it was created using ONLY source sound from DeepWarmth's original track (this remixing code has been the CH mantra for the last year or so). Dub techno drifting along at the rate of melting icecaps, blurry and spacious. The second mix, Evaporant, hearkens back to the first Ocean Lion album in 2008.

      "about": "Sleeping Under Furs is an informally assembled album that collects eight alternate versions of Coppice Halifax material from Vapor Acre, the Analog Botany series and the recent Leaf Cloak album. With an emphasis on heavier rhythms and thick bass movements, these versions were originally developed for live performances and club environments. As with many reworks in the CH universe, the source material is mutated and renewed, making almost completely new tracks out of the original sounds. Fans of past albums like Midnight Snax and Verdant Versions will find a lot to like here, and listeners who are familiar with the source material in question will likely enjoy this tangential walk through the CH backwoods as well.",

      "about": "Night Soil is an unplanned and sporadically assembled album, consisting of tracks built from Leaf Cloak outtakes (principally alternate versions of \"Night Grove\") that have been melted down and transfigured into something entirely new, and a little alien. Augmenting these constructs are three new remixes of Leaf Cloak material, carefully produced by Axs, Zander One and DeepWarmth, in that order. A backdrop of vacant acoustics, geiger-counter textures and flanged analog noise is the perfect setting for the gritty and greasy reggae-dub influenced tracks to work through their paces. Oil slick covered machine parts sit in irradiated glowing puddles, clanging out their mindless rhythms from across a post-apocalyptic mutant landscape. Long abandoned sheet metal shacks whine when the wind hits their angle just right, and empty radio bands crackle hopelessly for no one. This is the sound of nightfall after the world has ended, jagged and destroyed and forever restless.",

      "about": "Blue Shape, a designator assigned to remixes drafted for Zander One, a close friend and talented midwestern producer. Since issuing his debut album Echoate at my Recycled Plastics imprint, back in 2012, I've remixed Zander One eight times - each subsequent attempt becoming more familiar with the details of his sound. Since my remixes adhere to a strict rule of only using the source material to construct the entire mix, Blue Shape is literally Zander One with the atoms rearranged, alchemically displaced and distilled down to forms that may not have been evident in the original tracks.\n\n\n\nOriginally collecting the three \"Iceberg\" remixes on a 3\" CD-R, which was issued in a limited run of 16 copies when Echoate was released, Blue Shape is expanded here to a double-album length, collecting all three original \"Iceberg\" versions, the fifteen-minute psychedelic dub-out of \"Memory Faded\" (from the Echonine remix album), the seventeen-minute winter monolith excavation of \"Isolation\" from his Inner Horizon album, the bronzed, baroque and Cylobian take on \"Hazel Canticle\" (released at Shimmering Moods) and the hazy and waterlogged subtropical mix of \"Waves\" (released under his Endless Oceans alias). New to this set is a mammoth hour-long remix for \"Dreamwave\", from his newest Visions album on Sequel Sound. An edit of this mix was played during recent Z1 live sets, but the full 67-minute piece has not yet seen any form of release, until now. \n\n\n\nCH remixing Z1 will likely not end here, with these eight mixes. Let this expanded edition stand as a milemarker in the endless white snow plains of Z1's Ohio home, and a focused study in remixing as composition. Swirling blue and white psychedelic dubs for the cooler months.",

      "about": "Leaf Cloak is the newest iteration of the melodic dub techno sound that I set out to refine in the Analog Botany series back in 2009. The sound has been reduced (Inland By Night), expanded (Reclaimed Acres) and diversified with elements of other genres (Pawleys Island), and now it sounds as if it is equal parts of all three possibilities. Buoyant helium-filled drums underline emotive chord stabs and subtly groovy bass progressions, while bluish-purple strains of sunset pads lower the tracks into even deeper depths, indicated by several analog and digital delays and reverbs. Lush really is the word here, as Leaf Cloak is intended to be the techno equivalent of a quiet backyard in the summertime, as night sets in. Accessible, ear-tickling and still clubby enough for a dancefloor. Three variants on this album are also scheduled, including a remix album with remixes by Lamont Kohner, aspect., Zander One, DeepWarmth and others, a split-release of ambient reductions/expansions with Zwei Kreise and a CH revisitation that sees the material submerged in all kinds of aural chemicals.",

The Halifaxian template in 2013 has become a wider and more exploratory one, and translating audio from thought to form is a more and more detailed language with each new recording session. Static Physics represents only the beginning of what is likely going to be a very lengthy mining operation into the cliffs and ruins of years past. Reappropriation of sound as an artifact, rather than a sentimental thought, is key. Only through extensive reduction, transfiguration and mutation can true aural composting - or \"pharming\", in this case - occur.",

      "about": "TENTH ANNIVERSARY COPY 2024: \n\n\n\nIt's now been a decade since I completed this surrealistic monolith while sleep deprived in my Botany Bay loft studio in the subtropics of Columbia. At the time, I'd envisioned a composition that was designed to accompany a night of sleep - specifically, the almost six hours a night that my wife and I could finally rely on our daughter sleeping consistently through in January of '14. Parenthood was incredibly exhausting, and \"Night's Moisture\" as a tired celebration of some much needed rest every evening. This basic idea is reflected in the choice of \"womb-like\" rhythmic forms that resemble slow heartbeats, the filtered out drowsy chords that come and go, and the incorporation of field recordings from the very same backyard shed that is photographed on the cover. For the occasion of the tenth anniversary reissue, I've updated the disc face and sticker design on the physical edition a bit, and thanks to the changes in Bandcamp's file size limitations, I am finally able to offer the full five and one-half hour recording without any breaks in the runtime, as a single file. Additionally, \"Night's Moisture\" has been reduced to a \"nice price\" (night's price?) with more affordable digital and physical editions, hopefully bringing a humid night of Halifaxian dreaming to a new audience that may not have been around for it the first time. \n\n\n\nORIGINAL COPY 2014: \n\n\n\nLike several longform Halifaxian pieces before it, Night's Moisture is an experiment in depth and immersion. Taking cues from Winter Blurring, Verdant Overgrowth and the recent wallpaper piece Aeriformic Forests, Night's Moisture clocks in at just under six hours long - a megalith in the Halifaxian woods. Designed to be a seamless non-repeating listening experience for sleeping to, it slowly but dutifully moves through different phases instead of being a static piece. Loops of different lengths overlap in new places every time they recur, much like Eno's original plans for certain types of ambient music, giving Moisture an organically growing and shifting feel, despite the repetitions. Processed field recordings of my backyard at night, as well as delicate layers of white noise and textural room sounds form the backdrop behind the orchestral compost that the elongated chords and tonalities emerge from. Womblike rhythms with nearly no treble, which resemble a human heartbeat at times, burble in and out of the stereo field, occasionally bumping into each other, and a stately but effective two-note bassline appears in places to anchor the piece from complete endless drift and to give some of the melodic parts resolution. Night's Moisture is a massive sonic sculpture, made for comfortable listening through either waking or sleeping mind states, and compatible with both headphones and larger scale stereo systems. \n\n\n\nNight's Moisture is available as a digital download, or packaged with a CD-R that contains a special composite 80-minute mix of the piece, exclusively for the physical format. Also, following sometime soon will be a separate release of more techno/less ambient versions/mixes of the material.",

      "about": "Recorded during the same dream-state session as Whitehope, these three versions subtly mutate and tangentially explore the hour long centerpiece track on the CD-R. When ripping the tape the recordings were laid to, it became apparent that the cassette itself was degrading the audio more than usual. Having tested the rest of the cassettes I ordered in the same batch, I determined that all of them shared this odd trait. The tapes record and play back just fine, yet they seem to process the audio in interesting ways that actually add to the quality of the music. So I decided to release this cassette version of the album, on intentionally degraded black cassettes, essentially making this the \"black\" version of Whitehope. The nature of the cassette degradation means that no two copies of the cassette will sound alike, and future listens may reveal deeper grades of degradation, making for a truly unique and transforming listening experience. Deep analog forests of cloudy techno!",

      "about": "In 2012, while preparing for the Leaf Cloak album sessions, I recorded a tape of mostly live jams using a lot of the sound palette that would end up shaping Leaf Cloak. Almost immediately after recording these tracks, the cassette was misplaced, and wasn't found until earlier this summer in 2014. My memory led me to think there were only a couple good moments on the tape, but when I ripped the audio, I found almost 50 minutes of raw atmospheric techno that mirrored the Leaf Cloak album perfectly in some places, and went in the opposite direction from it in others. I named the tracks Chemist Cloak, as the music sounded as if it were dipped in corrosive chemicals and then altered in strange ways. A lot of the content on Chemist Cloak ended up minimized and restrained on the Leaf Cloak album, which makes this album an interesting \"behind the curtain\" look at how those tracks were made. Even in the shadow of Leaf Cloak, Chemist Cloak is able to stand on its own legs, with solidarity earned via pure impulse and brute force. It is dirty, misshapen in parts and even primal at times. A formidable counterpoint to the gentle backyard rural techno of Leaf Cloak.",

It was such a hot summer that year, I cannot even remember how this album was created. It was laid to tape and pushed to the back of the shelf, until now. Musically, it resembles a sun-bleached dub techno texture trip, closely comparable to River Tableaux. A deep blanket of fuzzy warmth, welcomed with open arms as I sit in my new basement studio, dug into a wooded ravine, in chilly Dayton.",

      "about": "Raft is one of the rare beatless Coppice Halifax tracks, brought into existence by the request of the Cold Fiction label, for inclusion on their Light Clouds compilation of ambient music. When I completed the session, I knew I wanted to go back to the tapes later with a full techno treatment in mind, and this album collects all four of my additional revisions. Raft itself is something that might fit into Inland By Night - melodic pads with subtle stabs that are obviously inspired by dub music, and a lot of texture and grit filling out the night-time pastoral backdrop. The following four versions are hypnotic swirls of Impressionist techno, similar to the material on Static Physics and Static Pharming. Longform, deep, droning at times, melodic at others. The twenty minute closing version would probably have counted as an installment of the Static Pharming series, were this release not already in mind during the making of the recordings. An hour of organic ambient techno that works just as well for a nightcap as it does on a heavy duty bass system.",

      "about": "Fissured Beach, or \"Before & After The Long Night\". Recorded in two passes, one being an initial session of drone-tail chasing and reverb smearing fascination, the second being an application of comforting bass and rhythm work in the name of recovery. So it is an exercise in both the appreciation of duality and a milemarker to note that a drastic change has now occurred, obliterating the previous path and forever changing the one you must now take. I know this all sounds rather ambiguous, especially for a release write-up, but it is what it is. I don't have the heart to make it be anything else but itself. Fissured Beach drones on and on, and to me it's beautiful, losing crests of synth chord shimmer in the white noise waves. It's very much in line with the Static Pharming template of long and deep and (somewhere in its bone structure) techno. Something to help me through the new night, where new sleep comes to a new me...yet I rest my head on the same old bed, and wonder if I'll notice the change.",

      "about": "In February, South Carolina was very unexpectedly covered in ice and snow for over a week. Being a sub-tropical zone, this was highly irregular, and as such, I was effectively \"snowed in\", hoping that we wouldn't lose power. Thankfully, we didn't, and what followed was a sporadic recording session inspired by the blanketed white neighborhood outside. The reduction of my rural surroundings to nothing more than lines on empty whiteness, and the quiet that came along with that, was really something to meditate on. It was a nice change to have forced on us for a little while, though I will fully admit to getting pretty stir-crazy by the end. \n\n\n\nSnow Vessel is an iced white equivalent to the summer's Ocean Lion template. Organ pedal bass, drones made of equal parts orchestral sampling and synthesis and crumbly taped-up drum machines are what comprises the special hour long mixture of isolation and fascination. A deep and imagined exploration of wintery sonic sculptures and incidental forms obscured by the snow.",

      "about": "River Tableaux is, like Raft before it, an exploration of sonic possibilities that divide and evolve like distributaries from a lengthy body of moving water. Expanding on the 2014 version of River, which appeared on the Futur[e]cho compilation at Cold Fiction, Tableaux represents a confluence of organic Impressionist techno, even including the original version of River from Inland By Night (appearing here in a slightly altered form as \"River [Inland]\") and mutating into the extended pastoral suite of \"Riverside Acre\". A deep and introspective listening experience for those of us who don't mind nature spilling over into our homes through our speakers.",

      "about": "Several years ago, I imagined a place named Whitehope. It formed in my mind as naturally as any logic or observation might - it almost seemed to already exist. I had to look it up to make sure it didn't. Once the seed had been planted, I imagined even further - what was Whitehope like? It was blurry, slightly warm, sunny with buildings made of smoothed ivory that could either be churches or lighthouses. A lighthouse might make sense, because I knew that Whitehope was an island, surrounded on all sides by a furious bubbling blue sea. It submitted to the ocean waves via rocky crags and clay-colored sand, while inland there were mountains surrounded by rolling green hills and pastoral fields filled with yellow flowers. It all sounded so perfect. I had to etch out some kind of aural tribute to this fictional place, perhaps even something that could stand up to the feeling of actually being there. So I set out on my course to find Whitehope in my instruments and on my tapes. Three different attempts to reach it failed, and landed me in different territories altogether that have themselves been issued under other names. Only when I began to give up on ever finding Whitehope did I arrive there, and when I did, I didn't even know I had made the trip. I had relinquished all hope of constructing my passage to this beautiful place to the fact that some ideas are just too perfect to ever create or attain. Then one night, while chasing some tangential idea in my studio that felt good, I did it. At first it was like remembering a dream - that foggy sensation that something made sense, even though it was not supposed to, and that you just couldn't forget it. I went to sleep that night with my completed recording and when I woke up, I realized what I had done. Cradling the sound of Whitehope are several layers (about a dozen) of oceanic field recordings - sea sound reconstituted into fantasist backdrop. Then nestled deep inside are buoyant stabs of chords that punctuate and propel a coalescing haze of pads, glossing lazily over a subdued rhythm section that could almost be a heartbeat. By the end of the hour, everything chimes together in a shimmering white glow, pure harmony. Now that I've finally reached Whitehope, I don't need to worry about ever leaving it, and neither do you.",

During that time, I'd amassed a fairly large library of attempts at conquering it, until I finally completed it on ABX33. Collected here are five such attempts, including a live performance of the piece at Conundrum Music Hall last December. These mixes are all Whitehope, I've since realized, albeit from different approaches and perhaps under different weather. Whitehope is not quite a composition, but an idea, an idyllic fantasy of a feeling that manifests as a place. Could there be other aspects of Whitehope out there, yet to be discovered? I firmly believe so. Although all that matters is here and now, right? Not there and then, when I just wrote the previous sentence. Here are five paintings of my imaginary island, in the currency of time and space.",

Cornucopiad is the bounty of my first Autumn recording session in 2014, heralding the return of cool air, the smell of smoky backyards and the turning from green to orange and brown. A celebration of inevitable death and decline, self-sacrifice in the name of composting and subsequent rebirth. Renewal through destruction and regeneration. Three pieces of Impressionist techno that tread the borderline between organic and electronic, as with most things this plentiful year has produced. So, make some coffee, put on a sweater and enjoy the first fruits of my Halifaxian Autumn.",

      "about": "In Spring of 2015, the Atrocious Symphonies label in Madrid contacted me to draft a Coppice Halifax piece that was deep, dark and thick. It was intended for their upcoming Compilation Vol. III cassette (which you can purchase here:  atrocioussymphonies.bandcamp.com/album/atrocious-symphonies-compilation-vol-iii)  and, as with all compilation requests that come my way, I sit down for a session devoted solely to the piece. This often yields much more crop than the compilation has a practical use for, as evidenced by the River Tableaux and Raft albums, and Monument, the piece I created for Atrocious Symphonies, was no exception.\n\n\n\nA single 51 minute excursion through murky spaces, flooded with damp and murmuring drones, punctuated by a watery rhythm generated via controlled modular feedback on analog FX devices. Monument is just what it says on the tin - a pillar of blackness, looming in judgment, with all tonal content created by processing tapes of human dialogue (specifically from the 1980s). There is something remarkably reminiscent of the monolith scenes in 2001, with the disembodied voices of Ligeti echoing throughout the alien location. This piece was also inspired by the processed recordings of NASA's Voyager spacecraft, produced by Brain Mind Research in the early 1990s - those albums have had a profound and lasting effect on my work, and have encouraged me to find melodious qualities in sources that traditionally have none. \n\n\n\nA six-minute edited \"dance mix\" version of Monument was created and released on the Atrocious Symphonies compilation tape, but until now, the full piece has never seen a release. Disembodied alien techno that hangs above the Earth, silently watching - perfect for the colder months.",

      "about": "A comprehensive collection of almost every Coppice Halifax remix released to date, spread across eight packed discs and bookended with a handful of colorful original pieces. The Cmx series started in 2008 as an ongoing open-ended narrative to chart Coppice Halifax's progress through the years, and six years later there's a metric ton of audio to digest. Running the gamut from braindance-influenced ambient techno to deeper dub techno, and everything in between, as well as a few subdued ambient works, the first seven volumes of Cmx contain some of my best moments (and also some of my most unique and expressive) under the Coppice Halifax name. While the series is by no means complete (as I type this, another two and a half hours of CH remixes await release at their various stations) this box set is an essential milemarker for the project, and a testament to my enthusiasm for the remix as an art form.",

      "about": "While prepping the materials needed to assemble the monolithic 24-disc Dripping Earth box set, it was discovered that the company in charge of producing the photographic inserts mistakenly sent me 15 extra copies of the photo I used for \"Sediments\", part 21 of 24. Never one to waste an opportunity, especially one seemingly sent to me by fate, I took this as nature's request for a second look at \"Sediments\". After all, what else can you do with a pile of photos, but fit them to a narrative, even where one doesn't yet belong. \n\n\n\nSo I set to work on my errand, going back to the source tapes and equipment I used to produce \"Sediments\" originally. Much of the Dripping Earth set was created using the same ingredients, but great care was taken to ensure no two minutes of the set were exactly alike. I revived the audio via completely different processing, re-equalizing and mutating and layering it into a much more dense display than it was previously. \"Sediments Reclaimed\" is not so much a remix as it is a complete reconstruction, built from the fragments of the original piece after they have been razed to the ground in total reckless abandon. What I ended up with is closer to something like \"Compost Dub\" than the Dripping Earth series - incredibly mulchy and wet, somehow technoid at its composted core, but also very experimental and over-textured. Something alive to wake you from the Dripping Earth coma!",

      "about": "In the wake of completing the monolithic 24-part Dripping Earth project, my mind was positively burned out. For a solid week, I did nothing musical, and reset my ears with field recordings. So upon reentering the studio and turning my machines on, the idea to do something short and sweet - an EP perhaps - became an attractive possibility. As with all things I do, once I start, it becomes difficult to stop, because my brain is constantly entertaining the \"What if?\" and the \"Maybe\". A mountain is literally and routinely made from a mole-hill, and once again I am off on a tangent...\n\n\n\nPhotovoltaic began as a one-shot session, the 18 minute track \"Selectric\". Built from pieces leftover from the Dripping Earth recordings - a loop here, a stored pattern there - it felt fresh. It was only after I began tearing apart the session recording and playing with FFT processing that I began to expand on the initial idea. Treatments were applied, segments were cut, and another three sessions later, Photovoltaic was its own album with its own identity. \n\n\n\nTopically, it sounds like it would fit right into the Static Pharming template, however upon closer inspection you will find a colorful array of alien sound design, mangled field recordings and strange, overly complicated and stupidly detailed digital post-processing.

      "about": "Appleviolet is a recording session from late 2014 that yielded Malus, a piece of composting techno that warps and builds on a sample from one of my favorite video games, along with four other pieces that tangentially explore the terrain surrounding Malus. The result somewhat resembles my Verdant Acre series, but also delves into more direct dub techno movements in the 'Hollow' and 'Rains' versions. Further still, the 'Black' version sheds overt rhythm elements in favor of texture, temperature and color, until finally imploding on itself across the micro-cosmic 'Malus [Obliterated]' in its half-hour excursion. Embryonic, primordial, organic.",

Grey Shape is a set of pieces that unexpectedly arrived from experimenting with taking the master tapes of Imperial Grey (themselves pieces created in part by transfiguring tapes from the Whitehope live rehearsals) and funneling the sound through different hardware setups. Elaborate comb filtering, sculpting with graphic and shelving equalizers and good old fashioned misuse of compression played major parts in this aural gardening session. The results are thick with compost, with sections that are recognizably from previous sources whirling together in the mix with altogether new sounds. These pieces are also distinctly more oriented to hip-hop tempos, rather than the usual technoid proclivities CH tends to exhibit, although there are aspects of Grey Shape that are absolutely techno, somewhere underneath all the monochromatic fog and polyrhythms. A lurching, looming off-blackness for your stereo to ooze out slowly...",

In short, a similar setup as the Verdant Acre excursions, though much different by the time I finished. \n\n\n\nIn my usual fashion of aural degradation and textural processing, I treated the tape loop heavily with all sorts of eroding and elongating, however no matter what I applied to the loop, the end result would sound beautiful. This became a challenge - overdoing the compression, smearing flange and phasing and detuned chorus everywhere, almost acting recklessly, abusing the tape and testing the strength of the foundation Smetana established in 1879. No matter what I tried, the music defiantly shined that much brighter, resilient beneath the analog loss, poignantly echoing across time the stately horns of the past. \n\n\n\nOnce I realized this fact, the sessions settled into a calm relationship of understanding and love. A soft conversation with an old friend. My choice of the name for the session, before even starting it - Redoubt - along with the source of my tape loop, came into focus as a subconscious celebration of contentment at home. I peppered the tracks with field recordings of my daughter playing with my wife and I in our verdant backyard. I imagined the redoubts in my mind not as fortresses built for military defense, but as safe havens, well worn from warm sun and embracing winds, built to stand up to the ravages of time and gravity by craftsmen long since forgotten.",

      "about": "Principally recorded during the Autumn of 2015, lost via the hard drive crash of Summer 2016, recovered/restored/completed Autumn 2017. Cedar Mastodon is one of a few records that nearly weren't, only recently retrieved and shaped into a final, gorgeous form after being stuck in digital limbo for over a year. As the name implies, Cedar Mastodon was born from the original recording sessions for Cedar Mast - a unique album that was created by using only the boot menu sounds from the Sega Dreamcast, alongside a single drum machine. The Mastodon pieces emerged from the provenance of the Cedar Mast Reduced release (a modest EP of ambient reductions that was issued as a 3\") when the raw Cedar elements rendered off of my equipment and onto the cassettes (that fostered Reduced) were revisited, with longer and deeper passages in mind. Initial sessions yielded five lengthy tracks, and two of these were worked into \"beta\" forms as demos before I lost a massive amount of work in my Summer 2015 hard drive crash. Fast-forward to Summer 2017, and I've finally been able to retrieve the five original beatless recordings from the Mastodon session, and finish my original intended work within the White Pillar Workshop, bringing these pieces into new spaces I never would've previously at Botany Bay. \n\n\n\nMastodon's lengthy walls of whirling ambient sound immediately bring to mind albums like Reflector, and the Static Pharming series, and these comparisons are not incorrect. The emphasis is on the soaring pad chords, constantly unfurling themselves in majestic sunlight and retreating into grey clouds, all while an extensively-patched and processed Yamaha RX11 drum machine marks progress in the waves, with a minimalistic dub bass foundation laid out by a Yamaha QY-70. These are gigantic tracks, not totally unlike the recent Subtropix album, that take their time burning through different elements as they are slowly presented one by one. The final pass on the mix was done via the warm, fat analog circuits of a JVC KD-A11 cassette deck, giving the album a crusty top coat that recalls the textured compressor abuse of the Coppice Halifax self-titled. Huge, warm, wooly and formidable, Cedar Mastodon is sure to keep you lots of contented company this Autumn and Winter.",

      "about": "Originally hidden in a very very small number of copies of the 5xCD-R STATIC PHARMING box sets, AUTOCHROMATA is a triptych of weathered and longform drone techno, intended to canonically relate to STATIC PHYSICS, REFLECTOR and deeper works like FISSURED BEACH or NIGHT'S MOISTURE. Constructed via extensive and mathematically harmonious formulae of processing, making creative use of low-bitrate sampling compression, tape saturation and analog reverbs. These pieces are somehow totally \"other\" while still inhabiting the Halifaxian woods and beaches, standing like secluded ruins of monumental structures long since overgrown or flooded over. Your only anchor in the abyss is a static pulse of a warm sub-bass kick drum, functioning more as a heartbeat than anything musical. AUTOCHROMATA, within this first volume (there are more yet to be issued to the public), focuses on very specific levels of digital and analog audio degradation, albeit in a controlled and directable fashion. Subsequent volumes will continue this approach, albeit with adjusted parameters - subtle shifts in pressure thresholds and depth levels as we map out yet another gigantic body of water. \n\n\n\nRemember: It's not a lake - it's an ocean.",

Recorded in three different sessions across two years, with principal location recording happening when I was away from home. A Blue Fume is melancholic night music, gentle techno for your ears and subconscious to ruminate on when you need the comforting nostalgia of home. Picking up sonically where Rurals left off, these three pieces are like a warm blanket of analog fuzz, tube-treated percussion, buoyant bass and tape-hiss bathed synthesizers. \n\n\n\nA second post-album session of more angular \"dance\" versions exists and will likely see a release in the coming months...",

      "about": "A lengthy, convoluted process that began with a truncated set of thirty-three one-bar loops taken from recently unearthed four-track master tapes for 2009 drone album. These thirty-three bars were then looped and mutated via all manner of analog and digital FX, including (but not limited to) FFT, low-pass filtering, pitch shifting and noise gating. A single drum machine - a ring modulated Boss DR-550 - was introduced into the mix to provide both contrast and counterpoint. Three more very different alternative mixes were produced, each going a little bit further down a tangential path than the others. In the end, Cubic Surf somewhat resembles the dance-oriented processing on Photovoltaic Fragments, and this album could be considered a companion piece to that. Another deeply alien experience for headphone and hi-fi listening.",

      "about": "Originating as a commissioned work for a compilation, Arc Test was fundamentally an experimental session (similar to many others) wherein attempts were made to create entire tracks from the genesis of a single loop. In this case, a four bar loop from a Fela Kuti song was extracted, bounced to tape and subsequently fed to the CH composting machine. The results range from the subtly groovy Arc Test, which made the cut for the compilation in the end, to the more mutant ambient techno of Test Arc, to the absolute isolationist windswept landscapes of Es Tract. \n\n\n\nFurther evidence in support of the notion that Coppice Halifax works begin with an idea (which is the door) and are put into motion by my hands (which are the keys), conveying through the vessel of equipment powered by electric current (which is the voice) and translating this indescribable clustering of energy into describable sound and physically observable form (which becomes the body of work). In short, Coppice Halifax is not created, but channeled and transmuted. Not just anyone could slip into my studio and make these things, of course, but I prefer to view my output as somewhat inevitable, affected by nature, pushed forward and pulled backward by time. As Michaelangelo once said: “In every block of marble I see a statue as plain as though it stood before me, shaped and perfect in attitude and action. I have only to hew away the rough walls that imprison the lovely apparition to reveal it to the other eyes as mine see it.” Thus, my music already exists, albeit in some peripheral dimension or plane of existence, and I am merely opening the door to my possible past and present tense, and subsequently, my future.",

      "about": "Principally recorded during the Autumn of 2015, lost via the hard drive crash of Summer 2016, recovered/restored/completed Autumn 2017. Cedar Mastodon is one of a few records that nearly weren't, only recently retrieved and shaped into a final, gorgeous form after being stuck in digital limbo for over a year. As the name implies, Cedar Mastodon was born from the original recording sessions for Cedar Mast - a unique album that was created by using only the boot menu sounds from the Sega Dreamcast, alongside a single drum machine. The Mastodon pieces emerged from the provenance of the Cedar Mast Reduced release (a modest EP of ambient reductions that was issued as a 3\") when the raw Cedar elements rendered off of my equipment and onto the cassettes (that fostered Reduced) were revisited, with longer and deeper passages in mind. Initial sessions yielded five lengthy tracks, and two of these were worked into \"beta\" forms as demos before I lost a massive amount of work in my Summer 2015 hard drive crash. Fast-forward to Summer 2017, and I've finally been able to retrieve the five original beatless recordings from the Mastodon session, and finish my original intended work within the White Pillar Workshop, bringing these pieces into new spaces I never would've previously at Botany Bay. \n\n\n\nMastodon's lengthy walls of whirling ambient sound immediately bring to mind albums like Reflector, and the Static Pharming series, and these comparisons are not incorrect. The emphasis is on the soaring pad chords, constantly unfurling themselves in majestic sunlight and retreating into grey clouds, all while an extensively-patched and processed Yamaha RX11 drum machine marks progress in the waves, with a minimalistic dub bass foundation laid out by a Yamaha QY-70. These are gigantic tracks, not totally unlike the recent Subtropix album, that take their time burning through different elements as they are slowly presented one by one. The final pass on the mix was done via the warm, fat analog circuits of a JVC KD-A11 cassette deck, giving the album a crusty top coat that recalls the textured compressor abuse of the Coppice Halifax self-titled. Huge, warm, wooly and formidable, Cedar Mastodon is sure to keep you lots of contented company this Autumn and Winter.",

      "about": "RORALAXIS, the ninth commissioned work for Cold Fiction Music, this time for their Futur[e]cho 2016 compilation album, appears here as an expanded work with two additional pieces from the original session. PRELURAL is a modest opening piece, establishing the speed of the pulses, the tint of the colors and the temperature of the waters that are to follow. Built entirely from a single FM-synthesized kick drum and 9 different recordings of appliance and electrical humming, PRELURAL casts a tonal shade over three minutes before moving onward, into the title track. RORALAXIS itself is a 9-minute piece consisting of some of PRELURAL's appliance interference, along with Korg KPR-77 and ER-1 drum machines tethering the atmospheric sound to the rhythm. Extensive tape processing, spring reverb and analog delay boxes dowse the chords (themselves a set of two tape loops harvested from the RURALS session tapes) and give the piece a considerable amount of grit and detritus to find its way out of. In closing, LAXIS creeps in and hangs just above the waterline for 66 minutes. LAXIS combines elements from both previous tracks, processed further via FFT and an Alesis Quadraverb. In this, the rhythms are melted down to an intermittent buoy of ring modulation and bass, while a grandiose wall is erected from the fumes of the appliance loops. Mixed very far away in the stereo distance is a buzzing Nand Drone synth, buried in miles of storm cloud reverb and flange. In some respects, LAXIS is the closest CH has ever come to making \"space music\" in the traditional (new age) sense, although it could also fit into the more experimental CH canon such as NARCOTIC MONTHS or DEEP EARTH. Headphone music for nightly repetitions. \n\n\n\n**EDITOR'S NOTE: RORALAXIS is a free track when you download the FUTUR[E]CHO 2016 compilation at COLD FICTION:  cfmlabel.com",

      "about": "Marais, originally a two-track section of the sprawling analog techno patchwork South Sentral Positronix, was always intended to be released as a single. Many friends who heard the tracks before they were issued even said it was heavy enough that it belonged on vinyl. Never one to sit around and wait, I dashed all that and put SSP out instead, always thinking the time for Marais might still come. \n\n\n\nNeedless to say, this is obviously not a vinyl release, nor are there any plans for such a thing at this point in time (unless some special patron out there would like to see this manifest - please get in touch), so Marais will now exist as its own micro-universe. This 60+ minute album was always just a 3-4 track EP in my mind - and yet, when I went back to the tapes, as it often happens, the rest of the jams from the original sessions really struck me as being worthy of release alongside Marais and its sister version. \n\n\n\nThese other 6 tracks are mostly totally new - the Ext. Mix appeared recently as the leading track on Cmx IX, bubbling along with spatters of rhythmic gating patched through hard-panned analog delays and spring reverb. The Redsummer mix is a far more spacious dub techno affair on a Boss DR110 drum machine and two Korg analog synths, and was likely set aside for consideration in the Deep Earth series at that time, along with the Heathkit mix, which (as it's title implies) drones through several layers of a vintage oscillator from the 1950s, alongside Stylophone, a mutant processed RY20 drum machine and the aforementioned Korg synthesizers. The Version mix, along with the original mix, have both been re-mixed and mastered from the original tapes especially for this album. Finally, closing the release are three deeper cuts: the Night Shift Mix, which blimps up the original drum machine rhythms via old preamps in vintage stereo receivers, and replays them as triplets under Quadraverb-soaked chords. The N-S Dub Augmix, which was apparently heavily edited and reduced for inclusion on South Sentral Positronix as \"No-Ship Dub\" - here it appears in full original form, with a far heavier rhythm section, additional analog delays and a second reprisal jam that mixes out a totally different groove by looping the last few bars of the original and processing them further in the live rig's feedback loop. Ending with the 14 minute Drawbridge Re-Map, which filters out the original chords into a resonator and ring modulation bed of alternating tonal currents, all while the drum machines are slowed to a plodding pace and dispersed in Moogy LPF chunks of sound that tug the droning foreground along. \n\n\n\nLike so many of the other CH releases, the emphasis here on Marais is reprocessing, reconstitution and recontextualization. The Halifaxian universe has for some time now been almost totally self-oscillating in its ability to grow new worlds from the DNA of the old ones, and this album is no exception to that ethos.",

      "about": "Aubreeze is a four-track album of sunny, house-flavored oversaturated electronics. It could almost be considered part of a pair with Aerate, where that release is all bubbles and spacious humidity, Aubreeze is a measured walk through a park as the leaves fall. Taking (perhaps obvious) influences from Mille Plateaux, Shinichi Atobe, Dettinger and Luke Abbott, among others, Aubreeze presents four lengthy psychedelic pieces that ebb slowly across the horizon line, subtly splashing bits of color around as they go. Also, like Aerate, Aubreeze was partially recorded at Botany Bay in South Carolina (Pomwater) and completed after the move into the new studio in Ohio. The title track is in fact the first piece of music written and recorded from the ground up in the new studio.",

      "about": "Aerate is a liminal work that came together intermittently. It started when fellow producer Forest Satellite recorded a remix of Dilate, from the Coppice Halifax & Submersion split-record Dilate / Erode. The remix was such a change in temperature from the dark and humid original, that I felt compelled to actually dig a little deeper, and produce my own version of his remix, which became Aerate. \n\n\n\nAerate was built completely out of harvested moments from the Dilate remix, fed into the Botany Bay studio rig and gently pushed out of two speakers this Summer. Upon returning to the two tracks in Autumn, after moving 559 miles away and establishing a new studio, I was once again tempted to play with the material, this time generating a 40-minute ambient atmosphere that played nicely against the blue of my new basement studio walls. Today, I have decided Aerate is finally a complete work - a small tableau of different colored flowers, picked in different seasons and from different fields. \n\n\n\nWhile a proper inaugural concept work to christen the new studio is forthcoming, the handful of new material that's been generated in this space has all been laced with a wistful fondness for the cool valley air of my new home, and a surreal feeling of disconnection that only comes to you after you finally leave the place you grew up behind.",

These tracks are much less experimental than Polysom, however they still retain plenty of contour and grit between the grid-lines of their techno rhythms. Going from a thick slab of dense dancefloor concrete on 5-HT, to a throbbing pastoral wall of static and warm light on Evoked Fields, finally closing with the lush twenty-minute-plus slow burn of Heavy Swamp, which recalls both the de-rezzed reggae of Jel Gun and the woodsy vinyl looping of Verdant Acre. Somx maintains a solidarity of constant bass hum and sub-level pulses throughout its three-path exhibit, making it a perfect companion for a DJ set, a walk outside or a discrete home stereo experience.",

This volume contains three pieces, like the first volume, that are anchored by hypnotic rhythms and sustained bass notes that intertwine with the waves of processed chords and drones. The first two tracks are notably more energetic and developed than the previous De-Sat tracks, with the opener sounding remarkably close to something from Static Physics, while the third returns to that monochromatic minimalism again. Between the two is a watery dub that connects both ends of the album's spectrum.",

      "about": "For several years I recorded about a dozen different sessions with intent to create an album called Whitehope, a pastoral ambient fantasy with varied degrees of dub and techno. I always got close, but not until late 2014 did I finally record the definitive version. Fast-forward to Autumn 2016 - I've just moved 559 miles from the subtropics to the brisk Far Hills of Ohio, and in unpacking I've unearthed a number of lost or outright forgotten recordings. One such find was a 120m cassette, ornately decorated with purple ink stamps of the CH \"sun\" logo, zero text. Upon playing the tape back, the sound of an almost-there Whitehope crept out of the speakers. This tape contained two extended hour-long sides, beatless and foggy with analog chords, modulating through what sounds like phasers, flange, hissy delays and low pass filtering. Side one seemed to be a bit more melodic than side two, but both have a charm that I cannot deny or even fully identify. It is entirely possible that one of these tape sides was Whitehope for some amount of time, until I had second thoughts, or what I felt were better ideas. That I even found the cassette feels like a stroke of luck. \n\n\n\nIn any case, here are two windswept towers of sound, looming in their majesty and gentle in their comfortable stillness. A soft, predictable and warming balm of Halifaxian ambient music, hopefully providing some relief from this chaotic and dark year.",

      "about": "Commissioned for a compilation release at Argentina's fantastic Temiong label (the same folks who brought you Imperial Grey), Jel Gun is an exotic sounding, almost hip-hop driven dub groove, sprayed in a sexy coat of soft white noise and buoyantly floating just above the horizon line with its sub bassline. For what it's worth, Jel Gun could be considered a sort of precursor to the years-in-the-making-and-imminent-this-year Ocean Lion 3. Tropical heat and humidity for prepared electronics and sun-baked island flavours. Backed with a previously unreleased extended version, this EP (yes, I do still make those) will be your go-to once those Spring showers arrive and you need a quick Halifax fix (Halifix?) without leaving the comfort of your easy chair...",

      "about": "To emphasize the image aspect of the De-Sat variants (which define and direct the Autochromata series and concept), it felt appropriate to experiment with visual representations of the printing capacities of the machines that routinely produce Milieu Music objects. Here, printer heads on two different machines were aligned, their outputs collected and arranged via papercutter and used to frame an alternate beatless low-resolution mix of the recent Autochromata III iteration of De-Sat. Additionally, printer color details were taken from the boxes of bubble mailers used by the label to routinely ship Milieu Music releases to your home, and cut down to be used as album inserts. This piece is, like the recent Ashcan Editions of catalog works, a perfect example of the artist's desire to upcycle materials that might otherwise be discarded, nodding slightly to many artists from past decades (such as those in the Dadaist and Fluxus schools of thought) who used everyday materials to create art that became elevated above the mundane to the mystical, simply by drawing a deliberate frame around it. The true physical article that these items might be a testing run for does not exist - only this proof of concept. To support this idea, the digital version of the sonic content on this disc will only itself be released once the physical copies of this are gone. Until then, it too only exists in a supposition. \n\n\n\nFour copies of this release have been produced, with three being made available for sale here. More eventually may come to exist as time passes, and as new materials collect and give me ideas, but even those ambiguous pieces will certainly bear significant differences in tone, scale and sonic palette compared with these initial proofs.\n\n\n\n**UPDATE: The first three copies have sold out, so the recording has now been issued digitally, as promised. Additionally, after a few requests were made, another 4 copy print run has been issued, with different colored artwork and different stickers.",

This single is the first of three EPs containing dubs skimmed off the top of the White Pillars, and features two tracks: 9v, which bounces with thick drum machine rhythms punctuated by analog chord spatter, and Summerpools, which conveys a deep sonic landscape via isolating both sub-bass and treble frequencies for a unique stereo image.",

      "about": "Upon revisiting my Womb Oscillations box set (released under my birthname the year my daughter was born) for the fifth anniversary reissue, my curiosity in returning to the audio from a production standpoint couldn't be resisted. The original release consisted of both unprocessed and processed recordings of my daughter's prenatal heartbeat via home and hospital ultrasounds, as well as manipulated room recordings of hospital visits throughout her gestation. \n\n\n\nMy current interests in taking old recordings and composting them into new things worked well in this approach, and after some basic prep work rendering aspects of the original audio into a serviceable set of rhythmic events, I completed the entire album in a single session that lasted late into the early morning as the sun rose over the valley. Only the original audio was utilized here to create an album that is equal parts hospital machinery, minimal techno and, perhaps most importantly, a heartbeat. The name Growth Markers was chosen as a way to convey the rhythm's sense of being on a grid, a measurement system, and to relate the growth of my daughter (who is now five years old) through a system of marked changes across time. \n\n\n\nInitially, I intended for Growth Markers to be issued as a bonus sixth disc in the Womb Oscillations reissue box, but after some consideration I decided it was better to leave the original set on its own as a document, and issue this album concurrently but separately. Here, it exists in both universes - as a Halifaxian techno album, topically, and on a deeper level, a sentimental bridge to something much more personal.",

      "about": "Recorded sometime around 2011-2012, these two tracks were created using a single drum machine and several overdubs of a vocoder. All tonal content was generated by feeding field recordings of various places and things into a noise gate with a specific frequency threshold (in order to narrow the amount of sound getting through the gate), and then sending the gate output to the vocoder, which would then use the incoming sound to make chords. In this way, Glissandic plays with nature itself as a generative source, and relays such seemingly random compositional decisions through a system designed to be more musical than the sum of its parts.\n\n\n\nAs an epilogue, Glissandic has been augmented with a third, extended dub for the CD-R edition. This new mix was created live using only the field recordings, vocoder elements and drum machine patterns from tracks A/B as source. Running at over 30 minutes, the \"Composite Dub\" recalls releases such as Narcotic Months and C, owing much to my influences from early Vladislav Delay, Mille Plateaux and Chain Reaction sounds.",

Con. came together in two different live sessions during my first Daytonian Summer in 2017. In many ways, this album is yet another line-treading act between what makes a CH record and what makes a Milieu record. Most of the time, I feel like my projects remain consistent, but every now and again music seems to make itself and I get nowhere by denying it. This is the sound of unrestrained, barely tamed bedroom electronics, bounding playfully through phase after phase of pattern jamming and knob twiddling. Waiting for you at the finish is an ambient Roland arpeggiator piece to dwindle the energy back down to an acceptable level. \n\n\n\nTo keep this very loud and very analog-led sound within that realm, I'm also issuing Argentine Confiture on a very limited (read: 10 copies) 90-minute cassette tape, with a bonus 15-minute track to fill out Side A more evenly.",

      "about": "Two extended pieces recorded to four-track cassette tape as far back as 2011, then forgotten, lost and found after unpacking from a near-600 mile studio relocation. With this much time passed from the point of genesis, it is impossible to discern the true intent of these recordings. Instead, I am focusing on what they seem to functionally do, here in the present.\n\n\n\nThe first piece is a minimal and slowly coalescing drone piece with a peculiar wobbly rhythm, which gives way to blooming sine tones and bass across the 20+ minute length. It resembles an ambient techno retake of the Milieu album Leaves Painted Purple, which was created only two years prior to these sessions. \n\n\n\nThe second piece is a more textured and spacious affair, clocking in at just under 50 minutes, which moves incredibly slowly through an exposition of guitar drone loops, as a KPR-77 drum machine emerges like lights barely seen through fog. By the halfway point, a majestic Lowrey organ motif is unfurled, and a dubbed out pedal bass anchors the track's bottom end, not unlike the three dense tracks on Pacific Opal Hex. \n\n\n\nBoth of these unearthed pieces recall a very specific time in the Halifaxian oeuvre, where long runtimes were still being dabbled with and the vaguely shoegaze influence, heard on records like High Hawaiian Fog, Pacific Opal Hex and the unreleased Coastal Reveries, was still very much in vogue. The title chosen for this album, Biorhexistasis, implies two phases of an elemental process, one which erodes and another that renews and restores. These recordings exist like a fossil retrieved from an epoch long since passed, frozen in time between seasons of change.",

      "about": "Mastodon Dub's two tracks were recorded in early 2016, just a few months before my catastrophic hard drive crash, as a proof of concept for the Cedar Mastodon releases. After time passed, and the source material was lost until this past Summer, these two pieces became a bit of a curiosity for me, as I was finishing Cedar Mastodon with completely different equipment in a completely different studio. These two cuts represent what Cedar Mastodon very likely could have sounded like, if I'd had the chance to finish it at Botany Bay. You can hear certain similarities between these two and their finished versions on Cedar Mastodon 1 - short minimalistic basslines, omnipresent thudding drums, a lot of spacious FX play - and yet these two tracks are themselves completely different as well. An interesting companion piece to the now-finally-issued ABX51/52 set.",

      "about": "The third installment of the ongoing Autochromata series, which utilizes a foundation of low-bitrate and lossy file formats to explore digital texture and unexpected tonal possibilities. This volume began with a provenance of extremely pitch and FFT processed recordings of Erik Satie piano pieces, played backwards from vinyl and sampled at extremely low bitrates. From there, dozens of automation envelopes were designed across the length of the recordings, affecting filters, pitch, stereo separation and reverberation in both musical and non-musical ways, essentially becoming (to some degree) a form of generative music. Length, as ever, is something that goes further and further off the deep end in the White Pillar Workshop, and thanks to the abilities of computing power, extreme runtimes are more and more within reach. What began as 40 minutes of sound mutated across just over half a day, and arrived at 13 and a half hours of seemingly endless Autochromatic microcosms. \n\n\n\nSo then, what does such a forest of sonic overgrowth sound like? To begin, a rhythmic anchor was needed to provide evidence of forward motion, and to maintain the deep pulse of distant Halifaxian life, beyond these light years of alien forests. This was accomplished by sampling (again, at a very low bitrate) the tiny blur of low end frequency pushed out of a cassette deck the moment you press play. This was processed, looped and subsequently layered at three different octaves to create a slowly evolving heart-throb drum sound. From this point, the expanse of generative work begins to approach across what feels like eons, rendering the hands of a pianist performing the compositions of a man who described his work as \"furniture music\" into a gently lapping stream in a pastoral wood, which slowly swells and overflows into a flood of harmony and vibration that takes your field of view down to the molecular level of sound itself. Here, at this depth, you can no longer discern how much time has passed - has it been two minutes or twenty? - and instead are left to focus your senses on what little you're actually able to comprehend: aural DNA strands as massive as galaxies, splitting and multiplying themselves forever. Autochromata III is a demonstration of music at the point of its genesis, illustrating the movement of centuries in a mere thirteen hours.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, an alternate beatless low-resolution mix of De-Sat has been produced here:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/de-sat-ph-apm",

      "about": "Recorded live on the evening of March 10th, 2018, and broadcast via audio/video stream from the White Pillar Workshop to the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club at Patreon. Tone Canal & Continent is the first of its kind, an almost \"proof of concept\" live performance using only a single Korg analog drum machine. Improvising from scratch, starting with a lone bassdrum, and building up a rhythmic microcosm that gradually shifts through three distinct sections. \n\n\n\nThe first of these sections, titled Tone, is a minimal techno exercise that recalls influences such as Studio 1, Pole, Plastikman and Thomas Brinkmann, among others. It leads to the bridge section, a live iteration of the track Canal (which originally appeared on the self-titled Coppice Halifax album in 2008, recorded in 2006) that initially involves bass-heavy dancefloor pulses that begin to break apart like shifting tectonics, spattering out in wet waves of molten earth that eject from the spaces between drum hits, eventually falling to the bubbling sea. The third and final section, titled Continent, is what remains of the turbulence - kicks and toms reduced to filtered smears of 300 Hz wobble, phasing out and trailing off into a haze of mixer feedback and artificially extended reverb tails. The vessel has sunk, and silently drifts down to rest on a black seafloor. All that remains is the purple sky that becomes darker and darker from beneath the waves. \n\n\n\nTone Canal & Continent is a unique piece in the CH acreage, bearing momentary similarities to other recordings, while also establishing a new possible trajectory forward in the realm of live performance and analog potential. The sound of just one drum machine, cleverly programmed and processed in realtime, becomes less and less monochromatic as a sonic presence as the piece develops, with the toms and kick mutating into a strange melodic movement. Augmented only by a noise generator, between-band fuzz from the local AM radio airwaves and a piezoelectric microphone picking up occasional artifacts from a bedside monitor next to my sleeping daughter - these additions providing no substantial tonalities, but an atmosphere, like a curtain backdrop - contrast, depth of shadow, measurable distance in an otherwise unmappable space. Hopefully, despite this being only the initial realization of this idea, it becomes more than the sum of its parts, and will give way to more attempts at music made within this framework.",

      "about": "Green Pharming is a recording of a live in studio Halifaxian improvisation, which was streamed via video/audio broadcasting online on the night of November 18th, 2017, for an invite-only audience of the Milieu Music Fan Club (  www.patreon.com/analogbotany  ). It was created using only hardware, no computers, and has been mastered completely intact, without edits or any post-processing that would obscure the source material.\n\n\n\nMusically, it could be considered the liminal space between the Verdant Acre series and the Static Pharming series, as the title reflects. It utilizes live orchestral vinyl sampling in the same way Verdant Acre did, and transmutes that sound into atmospheric waves that wash over and under a foundation of a Yamaha RY-20 drum machine, a Korg Volca Sample & MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer, an Arturia Microbrute monophonic analog synthesizer, a DSI MoPho monophonic analog synthesizer, a Grass C-TCM generator, a Unisonic receiver and a host of analog and digital FX, such as Moog low pass filter and MIDI MuRF, Boss RV-3 & SL-20, Alesis Quadraverb, BBE Two Timer, Digitech Envelope Filter and Pioneer SR202W spring reverb, all channeled through a Peavey FX2x24 hybrid mixing desk.\n\n\n\nPassing through phases of submerged dub warmth and vibrant psychedelic peaks, Green Pharming is a deep excursion through the ever-familiar Halifaxian sonic lands - drugged blue ambient seas, looming shadowy texture forests and a rhythmic presence as constant as a heartbeat - proving once again that somewhere in my musical subconscious, these locations can be revisited, albeit with varying degrees of clarity. \n\n\n\nTwo editions of this release have been produced - one standard CD-R edition, and a second more limited (only six) edition that includes a one of a kind readymade art assemblage. Additionally, rehearsal/tuning recordings done in preparation for this live set were selectively culled and mutated into a four-EP set called Phyllex, and these EPs will be issued subsequently.",

      "about": "Following ABX78 / Tone Canal & Continent is another recent live Coppice Halifax set - an eight section dub techno floorshaker called Vibrafoam Dub. \n\n\n\nVibrafoam is slightly related to the recently drafted White Pillar 9 release, which has yet to be issued, in that it is built using almost the exact same equipment configuration. Improvised live on hardware alone, in a dark room, this set pushes sub-bass speaker response to a hard limit, exploring heavy low frequencies with the assistance of ring modulation and resonant filters. Above the thick bottom slabs of bass rattle are punctuations of snares, percussion and hi hats, augmented by a surrealistic atmosphere built from the reverb trails of a piezoelectric microphone and a medical tone generator. Subtle color changes waft in and out of the mix, in the form of detuned synthesizer sequences, chord stabs that eventually become longer voices of pads (and vice versa) and a generally restrained melodic sense that presages the minimalism of Tone Canal & Continent, which was actually recorded after Vibrafoam. A deep and sometimes dark dub techno excursion, with strains of the White Pillar series and recent Occur recordings seeping through - and recommended for fans of my work in either of those outlets.",

Retaining the volume and weight of the previous EP, GREENPAINT, Greenfilter processes the source sound in a more lethargic way. Headphone tracks for stoners, comedowns and comas.",

      "about": "Throughout 2017, I discretely circulated twelve Coppice Halifax samplers - one each month - via printed Bandcamp download codes hidden in packages containing shipped CD-Rs and tapes from Milieu Music, Recycled Plastics, CO_RD Tapes and Psoma Psi Phi. This monthly series was called Valley Filter, and functioned as a sort of alternate-universe set of \"what if\" CH albums, where five tracks were picked and organized into cohesive runtimes, despite their disparate origins. Each month, one of these five tracks would be a previously unreleased track, often a version/alt. mix of an album track, taken from the literally hundreds of hours of offcuts/outtakes/etc I have generated through the years. Sometimes, the tracks would simply be in a different key and tempo, or have a different mix than the album version, but other times, the tracks were more or less brand new pieces - parallel universes forever bound to their counterparts in our universe. \n\n\n\nAnd so, here lies a compilation of all twelve exclusive cuts from the 2017 Valley Filter series, augmented by two more unreleased cuts that are exclusive to this set. The word \"filter\" is used here in multiple meanings: First, to imply association with the Valley Filter series, which subsequently refers to the fact that the releases were the collected results of a filtering process, such as gold panning, where only the best cuts were used. Secondly, the word represents the often unsung lead instrument in my studio, the envelope filter. While my mixer is usually considered my main vehicle for creating these Halifaxian microverses, it would be not nearly as sufficient were it not for creative use of filters in both the parametric equalizers, as well as onboard DSP filters I have created custom patches for, and further still my external filter processors by Akai, Moog, Digitech and Boss, and those present in my Korg, Arturia and Dave Smith Instruments analog machines. Filters dictate the physical shape and movement of many of my sounds, from the ground up, and so it only made sense to be able to finally give them the veneration they deserve. If Sunn O))) are a band obsessed with amplifier worship, then Coppice Halifax is the founder of The First Church Of Filter Worship. \n\n\n\nCome in, get comfortable, and melt.",

      "about": "Since starting CH as a project in 2006, I've been asked to produce dozens and dozens of remixes. One of the very first was a remix for longtime friend and influence Dissolved, for his Macrocyclic Blues album  (dissolved.bandcamp.com/album/macrocyclic-blues  ). In the years since then, Coppice Halifax has mutated again and again, shifting through phase after phase of weird and not-so-weird techno, never quite repeating itself but never totally abandoning what came before either.\n\n\n\nThe strains of that first remix for Dissolved ran deep in the project's veins, and it felt familiar all over again when he asked me to produce some remix work for his Hallucino Attics album  (section27.bandcamp.com/album/hallucino-attics-dissolved-re-constructed-2001-2006  ). Unexpectedly, I found so much flex in the material I was working on, that I handed in three remixes, and knew that more were easily possible. \n\n\n\nAfter the release was issued, and had some time to breathe, I approached Dissolved about doing some additional cuts, approaching them this time like the completion of an album proper. That album became what you see here, Etchings In Rust. Appropriately, it begins with a newly remastered version of the very first Dissolved remix (originally Slektramine), and proceeds seamlessly through six more remixes created during 2017 and 2018. These seven tracks recall many classic CH sounds, as well as influences such as early Autechre, mid-nineties industrial music and psychedelic drum and bass, some of which do not tend to manifest very often in the CH palette/palate. They are warm and crunchy, heavy in parts and spacious in others. Melodically they are equal parts Halifaxian and Dissolved, fused at the molecular level and transmuted into a rainbow of tones and tails. \n\n\n\nWith Etchings In Rust complete, the next step is a proper collaboration between Dissolved and CH. If these recordings are any indicator, I'm excited by the prospect of such a blend and hope to explore it soon.",

      "about": "In classic dub fashion, Accumulation Dubs revisits session recordings for the Deep Earth recording Amaso (which translates to \"accumulation\" in Esperanto) and transfigures the material (via further processing and selective overdubbing/erasing/replacing) into four deep dubbed out excursions. Starting with abandoned alternate takes of the original Amaso, which was created almost entirely with the Korg MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer, Accumulation re-processes Amaso's chord structures and rhythmic pulses with Moog and Digitech filters, as well as utilizing the MS-20's external signal processor to further color and reiterate Amaso's tonal profile. Taking influence from Stephen Hitchell's untouchable Intrusion project, as well as Pole's first three LPs and Rhythm & Sound's first few twelves, Accumulation Dubs visits a not often explored reggae-informed dub techno side of the machines and processors I regularly use. It's a slow, heavy and sexy album, perfect for night drives (intimate or solo), or mellow evenings inside, while thunderstorms rumble over the Miami River valley.",

      "about": "Following on the successful depth analyses of longtime friend and collaborator Dissolved's massive remix album Hallucino Attics (which manifested as the Etchings In Rust remixes collection here at Milieu Music), comes another deep Halifaxian long-player for the heads: CYAN EVAPORANT.\n\n\n\nPicking up on cues left by releases like Static Physics, the recent Arborist's Excavations box set and the Autochromata recordings, this 56-minute trip begins with emotive washes of synthesizer fragments, beached on the sun-burnt shore of a great blue sea. Gradually, the waves recede into low tide to reveal the shape of a metal vessel, lopsided and just barely below the water line. Slow breaths of sub bass emanate from within the rusted frame, suddenly bursting to rhythmic life in a spray of ocean foam and coral detritus. The colliding wet wreckage and diminishing light from the setting sun give in to the purple cloak of nightfall, until all that's left is a ship's hull jutting out of the surf, heavy and asleep like some ancient skeleton.\n\n\n\nCyan Evaporant is a vibrant, psychedelic techno excursion that emerges from and retreats back into ambient sadness, and manages to stand with feet in both Coppice Halifax waters and Dissolved acreage.",

      "about": "Earth Eraser follows the previous two live albums Tone Canal & Continent and Vibrafoam Dub with a triple-volume set of improvised synthesizer sprawl and electronic deep diving. Comprised of material from two different live sets (each broadcast online for the Milieu Music Fan Club here:  www.patreon.com/analogbotany  ) plus an \"alignment\" mix, created from the salvaged pieces of a previously broadcast live set that was so riddled with audio problems that it can never be released in full, Earth Eraser is a varied trip that begins with Vladislav Delay-influenced analog meandering, created using a no-input analog setup of three Moog units, a Korg MS-20 and an Arturia Microbrute. From there, the \"alignment\" moves through hypnotic sections of Microbrute stabs soaked in spring reverb and ring modulation alongside a Korg sampler mulching up a forward-backward drum machine. 1.2 reprises many of the sounds heard in 1.1, but further transforms them over/under rhythmic anchors from a Yamaha RY-20 and a Korg Volca Beats, and even slips in some warbling acid lines on a Volca Bass. By the time the 3rd disc arrives, 2.1 resets the brain with another no-input drone and negative space kick drum produced by the MS-20, giving way to the most melodic parts of the set in 2.2. Arpeggiators and almost-Berlin-school sequencing dominate this final set, which even dips very slightly into early nineties trance music before dropping itself into a void of feedback tails and whispering white noise. \n\n\n\nAltogether, a formidable tableaux of bedroom electronics, processed and performed with a Halifaxian approach that recalls moments from the Deep Earth series and albums like South Sentral Positronix. Recommended for fans of either.",

      "about": "(Recommended for fans of Verdant Acre, Lowlights or Fissured Beach)\n\n\n\nIt's been six years since we left the Verdant Acre, or tried to. The past can be a romance that's hard to quit, sometimes like a warm blanket and sometimes like a drug. Other times, it sits waiting to be discovered in the backwoods of your mind, omnipresent, casting a shadow over your agency, informing the illusion of your freedom to choose.\n\n\n\nSo, while retreading a patch of wet landscape in my sentimental estate, to pull some weeds and transplant some particularly nice flowers, I tripped over a strange object in the muddy dirt. Initially, I thought it was just the root of a tree, or a stone - something to be ignored or bypassed - but upon closer inspection, I discovered it to be the edge of a much larger structure. After spending a week in the rain with some shovels and tarps, I laid my eyes on the strange object - a forty foot long primitive submarine, that somehow seemed to be made of wood that had long since petrified into stone. I began to wonder if this section of the Acre had ever been under seawater, and then further deduced that if it were, that would have made this vessel ancient. \n\n\n\nSince then, I've been unable to sleep. Even knowing the unearthed object was far away from the valley I called home, I could hear it in my mind, calling for me to come back...and open it. And what was it, really? A piece of unexplained maritime history in the area, or something more sinister? Was it deliberately buried? Did it carry something that was never meant to be held? Did it contain something (or someone) that was meant to be sealed away? I had to know, and yet I wanted none of it. This surreal wreckage of the past, someone else's past, did not belong in my domain...and yet here it was. \n\n\n\nWith the help of some pills, I quieted my mind enough to pass out. What followed were vivid sensations of being carried away on giant waves, in all directions, with deafening white noise surrounding me and cold bullets of rain on my face. I couldn't open my eyes, and no matter how hard I swam, something heavy kept pulling my legs down. Once I thought of it again...that machine...I could feel it far beneath me, in the blackness of the water, slowly coming up to the surface like some eyeless marine hunter. The weight persisted, and I finally began to sink down toward what I understood were the dead and the damned, forever asleep in this deep hell. The last thing I remember was looking up at the surface of the water, from beneath it, and seeing no light. \n\n\n\nWaking, drenched in a cold sweat, I rushed into my study to write all of this down, where I will now publish it alongside a tape of the previous night's recording. Sometimes, the past is something you need to exorcise from your subconscious, and there's not a non-violent or non-traumatic way to accomplish that. Sometimes, the past can be a romance that's hard to quit.",

      "about": "Recorded on Earth Day, 2018, using prepared loops of tonal information from the (recently recovered) White Pillar [Recalled] EP, laid to four-track cassette tape and used as a starting point for an improvisation involving a Boss DR-110's analog kick drum, an Arturia Microbrute bass and a number of analog FX including three Moogerfooger units, a BBE Two Timer delay and a Pioneer spring reverb box, among others. EARTH DUB is a veneration of the first Mother, the source of all of us and everything we know. Coppice Halifax as a project only exists via the elements of the forest and of the sea, from the Deep Earth to the Verdant Acre - it is all hers. \n\n\n\nHopefully, it goes without saying that in the White Pillar Workshop, every day is Earth Day.",

      "about": "Previously recorded as a private commission in 2016-2017, Electric Fields is a collection of five deep extended Halifaxian mixes, transfiguring an unnamed piece of music that was written and recorded over ten years prior. With names changed, out of respect to the original commissioned work, these recordings have been given the chance to see a public release for the first time, making this five-album set an unexpected chapter in the CH catalog that fits in somewhere between Dripping Earth and Ferrolog, as well as bearing some resemblance to the recent Arborist's Excavations collection. At 5:30:24, Electric Fields offers a dense and exploratory listening experience that should be equally immersive on headphones as well as current stereo rigs and public address systems, and a perfect counterpart to the chilly Autumn season presently in phase.",

      "about": "Live streamed from the White Pillar Workshop to the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club on May 13, 2018, APPLEBLUE DRAM is the newest Halifaxian live set to be properly mastered and given a physical format release. Completely improvised using only hardware (no computers involved, no overdubs and no post-production editing), Appleblue is a heavy mid-tempo lurch that brings to mind the ultra-low basslines of the recent Vibrafoam set and combines them with the cloudy smeared hip hop of the Grey Shape album.\n\n\n\nHaving previously been away from the studio for weeks with a flu, I returned to the faders with a renewed sense of purpose, and maybe a little aggressiveness too. This set begins and ends with a romping elephant stampede of rhythm and bass, but in between those bookended moments are surprisingly light and melodic passages of playful ambient techno, reverb-soaked dub stabs and effervescent pad passages. I'm particularly excited to release this set properly, as the original live stream had some volume dropouts and clipping errors. This set left me feeling invigorated and excited to be back in the studio, and hopefully that translates through these colorful and potent blasts of sound!\n\n\n\n**NOTE: The digital download of this release contains a bonus \"continuous mix\" of the original liveset, unbroken and unedited, for your listening convenience.",

      "about": "While exploring the tangential variations on the SOLUS 3 album, a large amount of recorded material was generated due to the processing-heavy nature of the experiments. One such recording took the form of this three-hour macroverse, found hiding within the sonic DNA of SOLUS 3, and was far too engrossing to leave unreleased. \n\n\n\nTETRACHROMATISOL is a near-generative result of isolating various narrow frequency bands and non-stereo information from the original SOLUS 3 live session, and elongating/pitch shifting/filter shaping that content via Fourier transforms, stereo differentials and various digital/analog signal processors. Essentially, this is the shape of SOLUS 3's skeleton, after much of the topical and immediately defining characteristics have been stripped away. The several dozen layers of processed sound that were \"grown\" from this approach were then laid over/under/beside a drum machine & monosynth loop taken from a rehearsal for the original SOLUS 3 broadcast.\n\n\n\nThe feeling of an artificially created physical landscape is echoed in the heavily processed photography that represents the album visually, and TETRACHROMATISOL recalls aspects of previous CH releases in this vein, such as the AUTOCHROMATA series, the right/left pair of NEPENTHESOL / AMBUSILICATE and the procedurally built NIGHT'S MOISTURE. Thanks to a very careful FLAC compression, I was able to provide a completely uncut/unedited 3 hour file for your deep listening use, hopefully allowing TETRACHROMATISOL to aid in sleep and meditation sessions, in addition to the usual playback settings. For the physical edition, I've divided the full piece into 1-hour sections across three discs, with fades/additional filter processing, offering the option of more modest listening sessions.",

      "about": "In a slight return to 2017's two-part Springthaw album, the format of two half-hour live jams alongside an ambient backdrop reincarnates here as Winterthaw. Winterthaw consists of two extended ambient techno explorations that process and transfigure source material from the Winterspheres sessions (see:  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/winterspheres  ). \n\n\n\nThe first half, Nightly Quarter, begins subdued and distant, but builds into a larger and ever-heavier structure of overlapping rhythms and effects textures, generated live with multiple samplers and drum machines. The second half, Downtune Lux, is a further reduction of the ambient source material, with pitch shifters, noise gates and multiple reverbs/delays, over a simple low-passed kick drum and one-note bassline from the Korg MS-20 monosynth, while a field recording of a 2015 sleet storm unspools in the back. Together, these two pieces provide a stimulating counterpoint to the recent Winterspheres reissue, as well as revisiting a Halifaxian acre during a different season altogether.",

      "about": "The second of two Blue Shapes from two different seasons in the valley. RIVERBLUR composts, smears, dissolves and reconstitutes the RIVERBLUE ambient pasture that was ambiguously issued in Autumn 2018. In a classic Halfiaxian fashion, RIVERBLUR feels very much in line with things like the Static Pharming series, aspects of Verdant Acre and even the mossy dub techno of Leaf Cloak. Splashy and blue dub chords puddle up beneath a Springtime sunbeam, as filter-passed rhythms creep in between the cracks in the sidewalk. Invisibly, a mammoth rhythm section of analog kicks, airy percussion and a sub bass fill the air, while somewhere far off in the distance, a painter walks us through a rural fantasy one brush stroke at a time. This is CH at peak time, high on the Hawaiian fog and drunk on windy valley splendours. All the colors on the wheel, all the crayons in the box. Hi-fi psychedelic mindmusic for club and bedroom applications! \n\n\n\nNOTE: The limited edition CD-R also contains RIVERBLUE, previously only issued digitally.",

      "about": "Green Compost is the recorded result of a near-generative process, transfiguring the recent album Green Anthelion (a beatless atmosphere of densely layered field recordings and sound design) into something resembling Halifaxian ambient techno. Similarities to other CH albums spring to mind, such as Cornucopiad, Eluvian II, Polysom, Quinth and Monument, in that it builds rhythmic forms out of recycled audio content, organic outdoor sounds and non-tonal textures. Initially drafted as a single release alongside Blue Compost, which utilizes the same production approach and re-generative ethos, Green Compost quickly became a universe of its own, manifesting in the color-thematic release you see presented here.",

Upon rediscovering it, I applied a few final brushstrokes to the track, and went further with new coats of paint on three subsequent alternative mixes. The resultant EP feels somewhat between the Analog Botany series that birthed it and the more textured dub of releases like Leaf Cloak or Night Soil. Altogether a funky bit of composting for the heads...",

      "about": "Another year has flown past us, and it is once again time to collect the previously unreleased mixes from the second year of Valley Filter, a serial sampler that is issued as a promotional digital download each month and dispersed with packages shipped from the studio, as well as offered to the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club at Patreon as part of their monthly rewards. Each issue of Valley Filter comes with a single unreleased cut that is usually an alternate mix or version of an album track, although for those familiar with the CH sound, this often means they are basically totally different tracks. \n\n\n\nOn this second volume of Filtered Artifacts, there are numerous reworks of Deep Earth material (Amaso, Fokuso, Ebla), White Pillar jams and even an outtake from the Solus 3 session. Additionally, a long lost mix of the 2008 track Vapor Dub from somewhere around 2010-2011 has been retrieved, as well as two psychedelic phase-outs of the Appleblue Dram and Tone Canal & Continent material. A standout is the particularly grooving Lethargy version, taken from a session that happened somewhere between Earth Eraser and the Alignment Lethargy EP. \n\n\n\nFiltered Artifacts II once again feels much more like a cogent album that was conceived at one time, in a single approach, rather than a stitched-together collage of offcuts from several different years, studios and recording setups. It is my hope that it offers some interesting perspectives on my workflow and some unique reconsiderations of material that already exists elsewhere, in other shapes and shades.",

      "about": "These six recordings are extended beatless studies of the isolated synthesizers and field recordings utilized during the WINTERHEARTH MONOLITH sessions. The designation \"Residual Mixes\" applies for a number of reasons, mainly owing to their continued tangential exploration of the analog and digital synthesis at play on the multiple machine voices used (Korg MS-20 / Minilogue, Roland SH-32, Arturia Microbrute), as they are left to wander in the FX-soaked environment surrounding them.\n\n\n\nRecorded at different intervals during a full-day's session, they are adjusted, subtly modified and refined across several hours to suit my listening purposes as I worked on cartography. Across this span of time, the focus became more centered around the field recordings and textures (piezoelectric microphones on glass windows, during Winter rainfall) becoming more and more detailed and prominent, while the synthesizers became more eroded and distant, eventually trailing off beneath the elemental downpour to rest at a faintly audible volume. \n\n\n\nI considered not releasing these variations publicly at all, and instead only publishing the namesake original mix, but with the exhaustion that a new year brings with it, I felt they would be appreciated during the colder and more naked months of 2020, a balm and a blanket for those that need such a thing, as I often do when the weather is inhospitable.",

      "about": "It's been a wet Winter here this time around - not much snow, but lots of freezing cold rain. It's still enough to keep you bundled up, wanting to stay inside on grey day after grey day, thinking about sunshine while you drink coffee under fuzzy blankets. From early December, til early January, I managed to take some time away from the \"work\" side of this vocation, and focus on, among other things, fine-tuning my Chemex technique, making maps, reading mediocre late-sixties poetry and spending downtime with my family, ringing in those holidays (one right after the other) in the most low-key way possible. \n\n\n\nOf course, I also spent time in the studio, mostly reconfiguring gear placement, re-routing things to be less wire-nest and more efficient toolset. Somewhere in there, I sat down on one of these dreary days soaked in gray, and warmed up next to a hearth fire of analog drones, monosynth bass and a single drum machine, all humming in unison alongside a piezo recording of rainfall on glass windows, a subtle reminder of how nice it truly is to be inside, away from the elements. \n\n\n\nThis recording went nameless for some time, a sort of fleeting fog that was more a feeling than something concrete, although if you had to make comparisons to past works, this would very much appeal to fans of the FERROLOG album or deeper things like REFLECTOR. It also brought to mind some kind of a reprisal of the textures and melodic sensations on RURALS, but that could just be me. After a while, I kept returning to it for the same sense of safety and intimacy that I found when it happened the first time. \n\n\n\nAnd it happened, I remember that very well - I had hardly laid anything down on the sequencers at all, when most of what you hear before you now came purring out of my old amplifiers, spilling out onto my carpet in a wash of warm. WINTERHEARTH MONOLITH is yet another example of music that I cannot seem to explain beyond the most basic of impetus and ideas, leaving me feeling more and more that Coppice Halifax is only a window through which to see, hear, document atmospheric conditions in an increasingly strange universe. Bringing the fruits of these labors to you now, I'm not sure if it makes me feel closer to humanity or further away from it. It's a weird feeling. Must be the pressure change that came in with the rain.\n\n\n\nNOTE: This release is issued alongside WHM Residual Mixes, a much larger 6xCD set which contains six beatless extended listening sessions of only the field recordings and synthesizers - a deep 7.5 hour set for CH listeners who intend to go all the way down...  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/whm-residual-mixes",

The evening sun melts into the wavering illusions on the hot neighborhood asphalt, and the air hangs windless with a raspy voice of hot peppers and citrus. These two mammoth barnburners are the distillation of Orange Anthelion, a humming meditation on late Summer afternoons that consists only of manipulated field recordings, dialogue and textural experiments. Here, as Orange Compost, they have been cast into bright rhythmic shapes that recall Halifaxian organix like Verdant Acre, Soft Dirt and Autochromata. Deep and sweltering, endless, majestic. Intended as a pair alongside sister release Yellow Compost.",

      "about": "Blue Compost is the recorded result of a near-generative process, transfiguring the recent album Blue Anthelion (a beatless atmosphere of densely layered field recordings and sound design) into something resembling Halifaxian ambient techno. Similarities to other CH albums spring to mind, such as Cornucopiad, Eluvian II, Polysom, Quinth and Monument, in that it builds rhythmic forms out of recycled audio content, organic outdoor sounds and non-tonal textures. Initially drafted as a single release alongside Green Compost, which utilizes the same production approach and re-generative ethos, Blue Compost quickly became a universe of its own, manifesting in the color-thematic release you see presented here.",

      "about": "Much like ABX99 (Iced White) or other expanded singles before it, Valleyfoam was previously issued on a digital compilation at Cold Fiction Music, and now finally sees its first physical edition release, backed by two previously unreleased cuts. \n\n\n\nValleyfoam (and the second cut, presented here as Versionfoam) originated as rehearsal takes laid down prior to the live set broadcast that would later become Vibrafoam Dub. These two tracks offer rugged dub techno rhythms with sampled drum breaks, crumbling chords and a wide array of filter and delay processing. Built out of an almost entirely analog hardware rig and done in single takes without overdubs, only some equalization and bandpass filtering was applied in post during the mastering phase. Following these two tracks is an extended 40+ minute piece called Violetfoam, which was built from tonal content and the same sampler's percussion as the original recordings, explored and laid to tape in the Spring of 2019. Violetfoam resembles other deep cuts, which will be recognizable to those familiar with Arborist's Excavations, Dripping Earth and the recent Deep Works retrospective - drone minimalism cast like a curtain over sub-bass drum low end anchoring. \n\n\n\nWith these two supplemental works, Valleyfoam joins the list of singles-expanded-into-albums such as River Tableaux, Raft, Rainwater Chrestomathiad and Earthworks, all of which trace their provenance back to seeds planted on CFM compilation albums.",

      "about": "With just days left of Autumn, before the Winter Equinox arrives and drives us ever deeper into the cold black end of the 2019 year, I have two recordings that exist to venerate the soon passed season. The second of these, UMBER COMPOST re-sources and re-mixes the colors and contours of the Autumnal ode Umber Anthelion (recorded and released under my birthname) in spectacular Halifaxian fashion, distilling down the textures and field recordings into a vibrant paint set, and ballooning microscopic sections of twigs, wind and leaves into full bass drum and percussion sets, by way of careful granular synthesis. What was once a wind-blown metal chime on the back porch of my home is transmuted into a soft sequence of weathered chords and sunsetting organs, and what may have once lived life as a side of a jazz LP labeled \"Autumn Leaves\", sleeping in a scruffy thrift store bin, has since blossomed into a distant horn fanfare, majestic and comforting, heard from beyond the leafy valley next to the studio. My COMPOST recordings have served the purpose of both proof-of-concept work, displaying how possible it is to bring melodic and rhythmic sound out of things that may not necessarily be, and also heralding the seasons as they change, cycling through elemental cues and wildly different hues as they do, making me feel more at ease as things change, happy to see them rambling on, not holding on too tightly to the present as it so swiftly becomes the past, pulled back down to the Earth with such inconsiderate gravity, where it will be ground into pulp and fertilize the Springs and Summers yet to be born.",

The title track was recently issued at Cold Fiction Music, as a part of their annual Futur[e]cho compilation album, and sees its first physical format release here. All three cuts were live and improvised using a mostly-analog hardware setup, and were laid to tape on various dates between Spring and Autumn 2019. Further, \"Refocus\" was expanded on with \"Refocus II\", a deep excavation that fills more than an hour's runtime with minimal dub techno and warm isolationist drones:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/refocus-ii\n\n\n\n NOTE: ICED WHITE is available only on a 3\" CD-R, which might not be compatible with anything but tray-based players.

Winds and waves of processed field recordings stream quietly behind two analog kick drums from the Korg KPR-77 and Memphis Blue Beat drum machines. A soft ebbing hi hat from the KPR offers a distant counterpoint. Modulated chords from a Korg MS-20 monosynth cover the landscape, trailing through an array of analog and digital reverbs. After a while, blooming subtly from the horizon, a warmth of resonant pads emerges, and eventually fills up the stereo field like a flood. Halifaxian dub techno for a cool month filled with dead leaves, orange evenings and cinnamon smoke.",

      "about": "Sun Vessel is a rephrasing of Milieu's track \"Inside The Sun\" by Coppice Halifax. Appearing physically as part of A Warm Wooden Hollow's expanded double-disc reissue, the remix appears here alone for fans who would prefer to just skip straight to the Halifaxian acreage.\n\n\n\nThe piece itself is a throbbing 44 minute excursion, somewhat calling back to the early hazy mixing style of 1983. Heaps of tape hiss and analog compression help to coagulate a druggy substance made of Lowrey organ lines, swirls of rotary space drones and a Bronze-like propulsive kick drum and bass pulse.",

      "about": "After the recent issuance of an extended ambient Milieu recording, The Synthesist's Alphorn Retreat, fellow sound designer and friend Rimas Campe (Downscope, Treadset, Dreams Without End) decided to surprise me by crafting a remix of the piece. I was impressed with his reinterpretation of the music, and after thinking for a little while about how best to present it, I opted to follow suit with a Coppice Halifax iteration, and release both mixes together as a split-remix album. \n\n\n\nBoth of our remixes were done in a similar production approach, which entails using the original recording as 90% of the source material, and introducing only a single origin of rhythmic matter into the DNA of Alphorn Retreat. For my take, it was the use of a vintage Yamaha RX11 digital drum machine, which I have used in a similar fashion before on Ferrolog and sessions for Static Pharming and Green Shape. I also set the entire passage against a field recording backdrop of my neighborhood at 3 AM during a Summer night, and the rhythm of the RX11 actually seems to play with the outdoor sounds in magical ways. For Downscope's remix, his rhythmic input (as I understand it) consisted of a more traditional drum loop sample that was processed/reprocessed and mutated into the subtle pulse you hear anchoring his extended rework. \n\n\n\nTogether, these two mixes accumulate into something a bit more than simply remixes - they become a night (in)version of a sunny mountainside, trading in the orange hues of warm Summer light for the cool blue of a snowy valley quietly sleeping through the Winter. The photograph used for the cover was taken from my bedroom window, coincidentally the same bedroom window that graces the Ferrolog cover, and it felt appropriate for the transfiguration of Alphorn - a sustained fantasy of musical escapism, now brought back home again, to my bedside looking down on the trees in the valley.",

      "about": "Appropriately timed alongside the announcement of the Verdant Acre series is a long-awaited remastered reissue of the eponymous Coppice Halifax album. Although 1983 was released first as the debut album under the Coppice Halifax moniker, the majority of Coppice Halifax was actually recorded earlier than the 1983 sessions. When compared to what Milieu sounded like in 2006, it becomes quite obvious just how different Coppice Halifax as a project was to become. Much of the trademark CH sound started here, assembled by hand with all forms of aural artifacts, detritus, tape decay, compressor abuse and field recordings. Texture and grit were the tonal language chosen as a vehicle for these organic mutations that resemble psychedelic live jams rather than composed songs (although, make no mistake, this music was all very composed). Originally this material was given a very limited (60 copies) issue at Expanding Electronic Diversity in February, 2008 - nearly four years ago now to the day - which sold out nearly overnight. Since then, EED has closed, and the material has sunk into obscurity, never being made available digitally or reissued in any form until now. The 2012 remaster sounds much more crisp and clean, while still remaining true to the project's roots in lo-fi atmospherics, and also contains \"Beach Glass\", the second half of the fourth track, which was left off of the original release in a pressing error. Issued in an edition of 100 copies worldwide, with the first 25 containing a very special bonus 3\" CD-R.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, this reissue is the first of several to appear in a new catalog subset called Arboreal Digest. This is #5 in the set, with other out of print/scarce Milieu and Coppice Halifax reissues following suit.",

      "about": "RAINTHAW is a 67-minute deep and dubby techno excavation of ICE GHOSTS, an ambient recording by close friend, influence and longtime collaborator PARALLELISM. \n\n\n\nSometime in 2018, I was commissioned by Moody Drones to record a Coppice Halifax remix for an upcoming remix release for Ice Ghosts, and by that July, I'd produced a more modest 12-minute remix and this extended rework. For one reason or another (there are always lots in the record label and publishing world) the remix release did not materialize, but I was given the blessing to issue this deep cut shortly after offering it to Moody Drones and Parallelism, and it seems appropriate to release it now, as Autumn begins to lie down beneath a blanket of Winter. I've done many different remixes for the man behind Parallelism, and perhaps one day they can all be collected into a single set, but for now, Rainthaw stands as yet another example of the beautiful spaces our individual musical approaches can share with one another, when time and circumstance allow. \n\n\n\nRAINTHAW as a recording would appeal to fans of my more longform tracks on sets like ARBORIST'S EXCAVATIONS and DEEP WORKS, as well as seasonally connected works such as ICE FOREST, SNOW VESSEL and GREEN SHAPE. There are also subtle connections to recordings like URCEOLATMOSPHERION, SPRINGTHAW and WINTERTHAW.",

      "about": "With just days left of Autumn, before the Winter Equinox arrives and drives us ever deeper into the cold black end of the 2019 year, I have two recordings that exist to venerate the soon passed season. The first of these, VIOLET COMPOST re-sources and re-mixes the colors and contours of the Autumnal ode Violet Anthelion (recorded and released under my birthname) in spectacular Halifaxian fashion, distilling down the textures and field recordings into a vibrant paint set, and ballooning microscopic sections of twigs, wind and leaves into full bass drum and percussion sets, by way of careful granular synthesis. What was once a wind-blown metal chime on the back porch of my home is transmuted into a soft sequence of weathered chords and sunsetting organs, and what may have once lived life as a side of a jazz LP labeled \"Autumn Leaves\", sleeping in a scruffy thrift store bin, has since blossomed into a distant horn fanfare, majestic and comforting, heard from beyond the leafy valley next to the studio. My COMPOST recordings have served the purpose of both proof-of-concept work, displaying how possible it is to bring melodic and rhythmic sound out of things that may not necessarily be, and also heralding the seasons as they change, cycling through elemental cues and wildly different hues as they do, making me feel more at ease as things change, happy to see them rambling on, not holding on too tightly to the present as it so swiftly becomes the past, pulled back down to the Earth with such inconsiderate gravity, where it will be ground into pulp and fertilize the Springs and Summers yet to be born.",

It is intended to bridge the gap between the inception of Milieu as a project, a decade ago, and Coppice Halifax in 2014. As such, it resembles the source material just as much as something from the Static Pharming series, and hopefully illustrates that, once again, all the tributaries of my output flow from a single source.

Coincidentally, all of these songs originated from the same post-Analog Botany series session work, even though their destinations were all quite different.\n\n\n\nVelour and Swamp were given to the Outward Residence split CD-R with Axs at Other Heights, Belgium, with Velour II being an alternate version of Velour that ended up on a Spontaneous Rhythm compilation. Smoky, Sleepy, Gaseous and Blue were given to the Parallel Harbors split CD-R with Ohrwert, also at Other Heights, and VSS Acre was an alternate version of NCC Acre (from the Vapor Acre cassette, Wil Ru Recordings) that ended up as a digital-only bonus track for the cassette's second edition. \n\n\n\nReclaimed brings all of these pieces back together to form an undeniably consistent whole, which was ironically never envisioned as a full-length album at the time of these works' creation. An essential set of longform organic techno works that would appeal to anyone who enjoys the current arc of the Coppice Halifax sound, and a worthy expansion to releases like Vapor Acre, Milk & Quaaludes and the soon to be released Radians.",

      "about": "In 2008, I recorded an experimental album of drones covered in thick audio detritus, bearing the name Autumn Soil Feedback. In the time since then, A.S.F. has remained out of print and largely unheard by anyone who signed on with my music after 2008 (which is to say, a whole lot of people). So, as the Autumn season of 2013 settled in around my house, I decided not only to remaster and reissue Autumn Soil Feedback, but to revisit the session tapes for a remix as well. This remix is the Coppice Halifax Excavation, a massive 30+ minute piece of slowly evolving deep techno, where the original drones have been recycled and composted in that unique CH way, and new shapes begin to form inside the fog. The Excavation was appended to the reissue of Autumn Soil Feedback, but considering its length and singular potency, I have decided to give it a solo digital release here as well, especially considering the fact that a lot of CH fans might not enjoy the more challenging A.S.F. album material as much as this mix, although the door remains open and the challenge unaccepted, so that part is up to you.",

      "about": "From Coppice Halifax's inception in 2006, a thread of melodicism has run through the albums and EPs somewhat inescapably. Despite CH's topical obsessions with texture, density and atmosphere, certain compositions have emerged which (much like Milieu recordings) are designed for comfort listening, recalling sounds and shapes from the electronic music of years past. Influences such as Artificial Intelligence-era Warp Records, early Aphex and Autechre and Rephlex releases like Cylobian Sunset, Desktop Robotics, Wasted Sunday and Expert Knob Twiddlers - they all come flooding in like colorful waves of sound that pulse and emanate from drum machines and synthesizers. These interests provided the template for Q Trax, music created solely for purposes like reading in bed at night, driving with a loved one or going on photograph-taking jaunts during certain seasons. Albums like Milkwhite Plastic Galaxy Maker and Sno Dreem, and also the forthcoming Pink Acre / Plastic Acre cassettes, touch extensively on these themes, but until now, many of the earlier tracks that begat this sound have remained hidden, lost, out of print or unnoticed. Q Trax attempts to assemble a definitive set of these early recordings, with a remastering job from The Analog Botanist that hopes to spruce up old spaces since filled with dust and detritus and brighten the colorful palette once again. \n\n\n\nContained here are all of the tracks from the Lush Q Trax splits (volumes 1, 2, 3 and 3.1) with Foamek, as well as material from the early Nettles and Honeysoil EPs, a track from the Casio Commander split EP and a track from a Metanoia Media compilation. They have been carefully remastered from their original recordings, although some tracks were never initially recorded very well, so please forgive any unintended roughness in spots.",

      "about": "Hexad Lands collects the singles Hallex and Red Sand, both issued in 2012 at the Contemporary Vision label. Both were given a very very limited physical release, before the label ceased production on physical items, making the two EPs quite rare and sought after in the time since. \n\n\n\nMusically, both EPs were permutations of tracks from Radians, an album which was released at Recycled Plastics in 2012. The tracks were constructed using a unique compositional approach of taking looped sections from the final mixes of Radians tracks (not the separated session recordings) and building entirely new pieces by almost exclusive use of these loops. Thus, they sound and feel quite alien most of the time, and although they are connected intrinsically to Radians, they force their own identities through the wreckage of the loops. A similar, more subtractive process was applied to create the Reflector album, which was also cut from the Radians cloth. \n\n\n\nHaving gone back to the original session tapes for Hallex and Red Sand, two additional mixes were retrieved and subsequently cleaned up for inclusion here. These pieces were likely omitted from the original singles for the amount of runtime they would have added, and are even more disconnected and abstract than the single tracks themselves. These \"recalled\" mixes work well to fill out Hexad Lands, making the entire release a proper third element in an unplanned triad with Radians and Reflector. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, Hexad Lands is being given a limited (but still wider than previous) physical edition, for the collectors and newcomers who still appreciate and prefer the feel of a solid piece of art in their hands.",

Backed with a third previously unreleased track, recorded shortly after the Appleblue Dram live set this Spring, Perfume Triad is a solid hour of Halifaxian drone-techno, with bits of dub, house and ambient music slipped in discreetly. A nice apertif/digestif to accompany your warm Summer sunshine and/or your tired Summer evenings.",

      "about": "Following the first year of the expansive Static Pharming series, it felt appropriate to issue this collection of works that predated and certainly helped build the sound of Static Pharming and, before it, Verdant Acre. Eleven tracks from various sources and formats, assembled here along the common thread of their droning, organic approach to composition. The material certainly isn't beatless - rather, it is a statement of deep techno coalescing and thickening from beneath a curtain of gigantic sound space. These pieces helped truly define the modern sound of Coppice Halifax, and for that they work together in a significant way that may not have been apparent until now. Everything presented on Collected Drone Works is either out of print or incredibly hard to come by in the physical format realm, so hopefully this issue of the Arboreal Digest reissue series sates some of the appetites of CH collectors, as well as newcomers.",

      "about": "1983, the debut release by Coppice Halifax, recorded in 2006, and issued in three distinctly different and limited editions, the latest of which was nine years ago in 2010, on a 120-minute cassette tape. Each iteration of 1983 expanded on the original four tracks, and this fourth reinstatement is no different, with a 60+ minute excavation of Sea Smoke, conjured from the crumbling towers of memory that 1983 resides in and laid to tape in the White Pillar Workshop, almost 600 miles away from Lake Busbee itself. \n\n\n\nWhen Sun Cast was nearing completion in 2018, after eight years of recording work, relocation, parenthood and studio changes, I became aware of the fate of Lake Busbee and the electric plant next to it, that I canonized as totemic representations of my work, just like the Columbia water tower or my father's home in rural Loris, both of which also graced many different covers across years. The plant was demolished, and the lake drained and converted into swampland, instilling in me a deep sense of loss. That place was a synaesthetic focus point for me - I'd visit it in lucid dreams, and from those experiences came the sounds of 1983. To my mind, 1983 IS that place, transmuted and distilled into the final remnant, a mnemonic artifact. \n\n\n\nSo, I decided it was a perfect time to reissue 1983, one more time. 13 years after its creation, it remains a monument within the Halifaxian landscape, visible from just about any other plot in those overgrown acres and psychedelic waves. This is the first time the expanded 12-track material has been issued on CD-R, and as stated previously, it also includes a third disc, an offering at the temple, vaporized and chanted until the next time around. The ritual is over, the vision passed and the evidence etched into yet another milkwhite plastic galaxy maker.",

      "about": "Originally released in 2011, and recorded during the months following the closure of the Analog Botany series, Midnight Snax was issued in the middle of a hot Carolinian June on only a 16-copy first edition, and a 34-copy second edition, before going out of print until now. The seventh installment of the post-Analog Botany ABX catalog, it continued to expand on the dub techno and house music informed production work within the AB series, while also going into more bass-heavy dancefloor directions. \n\n\n\nOf the five original cuts, two were subsequent retakes of the AB track \"Pine\", while another track recorded during the sessions (but omitted), \"Mintmorning\" led to the Leaf Cloak album that followed. In this way, Midnight Snax feels almost more like a bridge between the Analog Botany series proper, and the sort of \"Mark II\" material that would inform the more organic and compost-minded CH releases in the following years. These five tracks have been gently remastered in the White Pillar Workshop, and augmented with three previously unreleased cuts from the original sessions. The \"Blue Silver\" mix is first, a crusty, humid house track, built on a Korg ES-1 sampler alongside a Boss DR-660 and a Roland SH-32 digital polysynth. \"Orangerie\" reprises the original mix with a more Speicher-influenced schaffel and additional drum machine work. \"Lime Fizzy\" closes the expanded album with a deeper and more reggae-dub take on the \"Carbonated\" mix, which contrasts against its faster tempos and heavier rhythms. \n\n\n\nHaving spent some time with these recordings again after nearly nine years of space, I feel that Midnight Snax is even more boldly colorful, accessible and seasonally appropriate than it's ever been. For fans of the Analog Botany series, Leaf Cloak or even the more recent White Pillar series, there is a lot of heavy groove on offer here. An excursion well worth taking as the Spring breeze begins to blow in...",

      "about": "Originally a 2-track EP distributed discreetly as a promotional item with Milieu Music web store orders (circa 2016-2017), Soft Dirt has lain dormant in my archives since drawing up those 20 or so CD-Rs. Three tracks of Earthy, raw techno that aren't afraid of getting loud or heavy, while still remaining beautifully decorated with gem-lined majesty. The first two tracks were two of the very first ones I recorded in the proto-version of my current studio, which then consisted of only a corner of drum machines, analog synths and FX piled on top of a few moving boxes and haphazardly wired in and out of a small Mackie mixer. Revisiting this material earlier this Summer yielded a third expansive cut to the release, possibly the most spacious and dub-minded of the three. Soft Dirt is the perfect sound to push through car stereos and PA systems to distract from the blistering heat of the Summer, although I suspect the crunchy textures and buzzing overdriven bass sections of these tracks will weather well into the Autumn also. Here and now, Soft Dirt is exhumed for the ears of the world, beyond the twenty people who were privy to it the first time around...",

      "about": "From Summer 2017 to Summer 2018, I issued four short-run EPs on three-inch CD-Rs that contained fuzzed-out and speaker rattling techno. Smeared dub mixes of material recorded mostly for the White Pillar series, these EPs were somewhat created as a colorful rhythm-heavy sideline to the more greyscale and spacious White Pillar tracks. \n\n\n\nNow, another Summer has passed, and I've decided to pool these recordings together into a greater whole, a double-album set that collects the original session recordings for ABX65 (Worktop Dub) / ABX66 (Irondrum Dub) / ABX67 (Thrujack Dub) / ABX81 (Baseband Dub), and augments/expands them with five previously unreleased tracks, themselves recorded between 2018-2019. Fourteen tracks in all, two and a half hours of heavy CH dub. \n\n\n\nStylistically, these tracks most resemble many of the alternate versions highlighted on Filtered Artifacts I and II, as well as some of the Phyllex recordings, which are also soon to be compiled/expanded. Thick low-res slabs of bass and subwoofer buzz collide with analog noise and tape-worn texture, all circling around warped 2VCO and 3VCO alien chords. Influences include Rod Modell's Incense & Black Light record, Demdike Stare's Whitelabels, Wolfgang Voigt's Freiland 12\"s, the Phase90 recordings at Echospace and some of the Vatican Shadow material reissued at Modern Love.",

This mix was drafted during the remastering sessions for WHITE/NIGHT/BLACK/RED ANTHELION's collective 3xCD-R reissue as a way to revisit and explore the original audio tapes within an expanded and differently equipped studio setting. Until now, it has only been made available as part of that 3xCD-R reissue set, and after a few requests for it to be issued on its own, I've acquiesced and presented it here with its own catalog number and photographic artwork. Musically, DUSK LION would appeal to fans of things like ARBORIST'S EXCAVATIONS, CORNUCOPIAD, FISSURED BEACH and even VERDANT ACRE. Deep, electric drones covered in mossy textural drapes and evening hues, set against sub-bass rhythmic work and organic field recording spatter. \n\n\n\nEXPLORE THE ENTIRE ANTHELION SESSIONS FROM 2008 HERE:  briangrainger.bandcamp.com/album/anthelion-complete-2008-sessions",

      "about": "RITMO EN FOKUSO is the first EP in the new DEEP EARTH series. DEEP EARTH will run for at least a year, issuing an EP each month in the style of Static Pharming, the Analog Botany series or the Workingman's Drone series. What's different about DEEP EARTH is that it also offers a subscription option, wherein subscribers will receive exclusive music and other surprises on top of the existing monthly series. \n\n\n\nMusically speaking, DEEP EARTH's sound is made entirely on electronic and mostly analog hardware. Heavy use of retrograde drum machines, synths and FX units are treated harmoniously alongside reel to reel tape, contact microphones and lab equipment from the 1950s. Influences like Mika Vainio, Eliane Radigue, Aleksi Perala's Colundi project and Vladislav Delay combine with my love for organic ambient music, minimal techno and Impressionist concepts. An exploration of sound and design unlike any I've attempted before.",

      "about": "Over time, a number of materials pile up through the process of packaging and shipping so many copies of so many releases, with a considerable amount of containers, sleeves and jackets that are discarded for cosmetic or other minor flaws. In the interest of wasting as little material as possible in my studio, I set these cast-offs aside until I have enough to use for assembling a new project entirely. This process has given way to what I have dubbed \"Ashcan Editions\" of certain releases - incredibly limited, built with recycled materials and often containing alternative mixes/versions of the original audio as well. \n\n\n\nVaporous Post is such a release, being born from a reprocessing of the master tapes for the sprawling 24xCD Dripping Earth set. The original recordings have been completely transfigured via a process involving mid-side equalization and pitch shifting, with warm analog reverb and compressors - an absolute reshaping and reimagining of this already deep and tangential source sound. \n\n\n\nSonically speaking, these revisions are much more ambient in tone and texture, with many of the details melted down and smeared through processing and re-placement. Still, the chord structures and shifts between changes remain present, even from a completely different vantage point, offering an experience that is somehow equal parts sub-vibrational drone, dub techno and ambient meditation. Influences of Variant's Vortexual series at Echospace, Wolfgang Voigt's first GAS album (as well as bits of Pop) and the late Michael Mantra's work all came to mind during these sessions.\n\n\n\nIt felt fitting then, that these reworks be carried in a physical vessel that is, in and of itself, a recycled object. The entire 24xCD affair exists inside six slightly damaged 4xCD plastic boxes, whose only flaw is that the inside hinges that hold the disc trays in place are broken. I have exactly twelve such cases, meaning there are only TWO copies of Vaporous Post in existence. As \"Ashcan Editions\" only tend to materialize when I have enough packaging I can re-fit, releases like these are sporadic and impulsive, and I quite enjoy having outlets like these to explore tangents and force myself to consider things in a packaging first/reverse engineered kind of way. \n\n\n\nThe two copies of Vaporous Post are signed and numbered, and sell/ship with the caveat that the buyer accepts the re-fitted/recycled aspect of the materials used. No returns or refunds, these are for the most dedicated collectors and listeners only. Considering the price of the original Dripping Earth series was $300, Vaporous Post has been priced to reflect the damaged nature of the cases, but also the uniqueness of the audio. Your consideration and understanding in this area is appreciated.",

      "about": "Deep Earth is a project that began in May 2015, with the initial recordings happening a few months before. It was conceived as a monthly series that would yield a minimum of 20 minutes of sound per installment, plus peripheral installments of discarded material (or forĵetitaj). The series was set up as a subscription service, wherein supporters would exclusively receive the \"forĵetitaj\" recordings, in addition to the main run of releases. By May 2016, the project held enough support to be considered a success, and was subsequently reinstated for a second year, and again for a third (currently in progress). \n\n\n\nMusically, Deep Earth sounds like almost nothing else in the entire Milieu Music catalog. It is almost entirely recorded live, in a dark bedroom studio, using old amps for monitors (no headphones), tape machines, archaic laboratory equipment, vintage rhythm boxes, analog and digital synthesizers and a wide array of traditional and unorthodox FX units. It is the closest I've ever come to achieving a kind of total sonic isolationism, the aural equivalent of a long-lost military bunker beneath the polar ice, whose tunnels lead downward into a hidden underworld of unmapped hollow earth. Exploration as performance, improvisation in lieu of composition. \n\n\n\nAs with the first year, Year Two of the series has yielded massive amounts of material - 20 hours, 48 minutes and 23 seconds - no small effort, considering that I relocated from the subtropics to a midwestern valley almost 600 miles away, in the middle of the series. The new studio, White Pillar Workshop, immediately afforded more possibility than Botany Bay did, so it is interesting to see the pivot points between the two studios during Year Two's trajectory. Somewhat coincidentally (because as the runtimes on DE tracks should tell you, none of these recordings are \"planned\" like regular albums are) we have ended up yet again with 16 CD-Rs of music, filled out with almost five hours of previously unissued recordings.\n\n\n\nAll twelve of the public catalog releases, all twelve of the private subscriber-only Forĵetitaj releases, audio versions of both of Year Two's video singles, plus a beautiful array of extras. Outtakes and alternative versions from throughout the series, a truly comprehensive tableaux of the continually mutant and alien project - arranged carefully across sixteen discs, with custom stickers, 16 photographic print inserts, hidden messages and a sturdy lidded plastic box. A monolith of greyscale electronic music, with equal parts throbbing techno, dusky ambient, minimalistic drones and texture-thickened experimentalism. \n\n\n\nNOTE: Out of respect to the Deep Earth subscribers and their incredible support of this project, I've turned off streaming for the Forĵetitaj material, as well as the five hours of new unreleased material. Basically, since the subscribers paid for this content, it is packaged only in the downloadable and physical editions of this release. Subscribers to the series receive all of the previously unreleased material for free, in addition to the entire series up to this point.",

      "about": "I've been wanting to assemble a collection like this for some time, and I think I've finally landed it here. Deep Works is an eight-disc set that compiles eighteen different longform CH cuts from eighteen different releases issued between 2012 and 2016. These dates are contextually connected to these recordings, as CH really began to produce longer and more impressionistic tracks right after my daughter was born in April of 2012, and this was in part due to the Botany Bay studio being set up only a year prior. This set follows many of the tangents laid to tape in that space, \"finding a way\" as Rhythm & Sound may have said, up to the last year I would spend in the room before relocating to Ohio in the Autumn of 2016. \n\n\n\nEven as full as this collection is, it still leaves many landmark longform recordings out, such as Cornucopiad, Whitehope / Whitehope Versions, Monument and the 24-hour Dripping Earth series. Those releases would be the first suggested paths outward from this set, a map for anyone who is a newcomer to the Halifaxian acres, or even a seasoned explorer who might want to travel back in time a bit. Sonically, many of these pieces were created using a minimum of hardware running into and out of a massive saturation of FX processing, and all of them were completed in the Botany Bay studio, minus the Conundrum Music Hall live performance of Whitehope, which was the only live set I've ever done using the vintage tape machines and archaic analog gear that, under normal circumstances, never actually leaves my studio. In this way, the Whitehope set is very much Botany Bay mobilized and transplanted onto a stage, although at the time, only a very small crowd was there to experience it. \n\n\n\nIt is my hope that this retrospective provides useful contexts and perspectives on the CH back catalog, as any good retrospective should. Today, many of these recordings might be overshadowed by the much longer and much deeper overgrowths that have since become the dominant flora in the Halifaxian landscape, so it's good to spend some time in the past, sometimes, and really get a sense of where I've been.",

      "about": "After a decent amount of requests for it, I've decided to issue a public iteration of this compendium. ARBORIST'S EXCAVATIONS collects and compiles all of the Coppice Halifax remixes (to date) that have been drafted in support of Arboreal Digest series reissues, and a couple other Milieu Music releases. These remixes have developed into a sort of ritual, allowing me the opportunity to mine old master tapes of material for new and interesting shapes and textures. As with many CH recordings, it follows that these separately issued pieces come together exceptionally well to form a cogent whole, perhaps owing to the consistency of CH as a vessel. \n\n\n\nIn any case, the entirety of the set has been included here digitally, with the exception of the tenth disc (two remixes for the as-yet-unreleased remaster/reissue of A Dusty Box Of Old Memories), which has been kept as a physical box set exclusive out of respect to Illuminated Paths, the label soon issuing that expansive remaster. The digital release has been priced lower than the cost of its combined parts, 10 hours of music for under $100, making it a convenient bargain for those of you who do not wish to collect all of the associated reissues in order to obtain the CH mixes.",

      "about": "Sixteen white discs, laser-etched with 20 hours 13 minutes and 42 seconds of subterranean synthesis, across seventy-one tracks. The third year of Deep Earth is no less substantial than the first two, and the fourth year is already underway. As before, Year Three Compleat collects all 12 public releases, all 12 private releases, all video singles and five hours of previously unreleased material from those sessions.\n\n\n\nDeep Earth is the longest running consecutive monthly series I've maintained since starting the CH project in 2006. There was a small break from July to December of 2018, but even during that time, aspects of the series were finished and issued, and others ran in the background. It has always symbolized the borderlands of the Halifaxian acreage, an unmapped and alien expanse that both informed and contradicted the 'canon' of CH albums that were drafted and issued outside of it. It has been host to bodiless drone paths, dense techno rock walls, steep ambient canyons and synthetic light trails, billowing through the cavernous dark. \n\n\n\nYear Three seemed to mostly focus on both solo-machine studies and massive 20+ channel gear configurations, swimming in wires and blinking LEDs. It began with three extended four-track cassette explorations of the Grass Click-Tone Control Module, a medical unit I added to the studio a couple years ago that generates tone, and followed with four pieces built using only the Korg MS-20 monophonic analog synthesizer. These recordings gave way to many other experiments, using everything from digital arpeggiators to mixer feedback, from MIDI-free setups to tightly wound industrial noise. The Transiro tracks recall the filter-passed tonal rhythms of the first year of the series, and the Kolizii tracks introduce house music rhythms and patterns to Deep Earth's palette for the first time. Foresto zooms into digital 12-bit sampling and tape loops on a molecular level, and the Solvita tracks reveal hidden rhythmic shapes inside stereo differentials. \n\n\n\nYear Three's sessions seem to both push CH further out than it's ever been, while also bringing the series itself closer to the sound of non-Deep Earth recordings than before...perhaps recalling the mantra of the entire approach: Tempo Pulsos Malfokusita / Time Pulses Out Of Focus. Deep Earth is sometimes near, sometimes far, always peripheral and perpetually in motion. It remains a healthy discipline in artistic perspective, and a motivation for getting the very most out of the studio equipment I have, and for these reasons alone, it may go on forever.",

      "about": "Deep Earth is a project that began in May 2015, with the initial recordings happening a few months before. It was conceived as a monthly series that would yield a minimum of 20 minutes of sound per installment, plus peripheral installments of discarded material (or forĵetitaj). The series was set up as a subscription service, wherein supporters would exclusively receive the \"forĵetitaj\" recordings, in addition to the main run of releases. By May 2016, the project held enough support to be considered a success, and was subsequently reinstated for a second year, starting in June (which is currently running now). \n\n\n\nMusically, Deep Earth sounds like almost nothing else in the entire Milieu Music catalog. It is almost entirely recorded live, in a dark bedroom studio, using old amps for monitors (no headphones), tape machines, archaic laboratory equipment, vintage rhythm boxes, analog and digital synthesizers and a wide array of traditional and unorthodox FX units. It is the closest I've ever come to achieving a kind of total sonic isolationism, the aural equivalent of a long-lost military bunker beneath the polar ice, whose tunnels lead downward into a hidden underworld of unmapped hollow earth. Exploration as performance, improvisation in lieu of composition. \n\n\n\nThere was such a wealth of material recorded for the first year of Deep Earth, that the idea of an exhaustive box set collection became attractive (and you know how much we like our box sets here at Milieu Music), so I'm finally beaming with pride as I bring you this Year One Compleat set of 16 discs. Year One Compleat contains all twelve of the monthly Deep Earth installments, all twelve of the \"forĵetitaj\" installments (previously only released to subscribers) as well as the Unuopaĵojn (singles) double-album, the precursor recording Antaŭparolo (also subscriber-only) and...FIVE HOURS of previously unreleased Deep Earth recordings. Outtakes and alternative versions from throughout the series, a truly comprehensive tableaux of everything that was Deep Earth - from its embryonic moments to its current heavy momentum - arranged carefully across sixteen discs, with custom stickers, 16 photographic print inserts, hidden messages and a sturdy lidded plastic box. A monolith of greyscale electronic music, with equal parts throbbing techno, dusky ambient, minimalistic drones and texture-thickened experimentalism.\n\n\n\nNOTE: Out of respect to the Deep Earth subscribers and their incredible support of this project, I've turned off streaming for the Forĵetitaj material, as well as the five hours of new unreleased material. Basically, since the subscribers paid for this content, it is packaged only in the downloadable and physical editions of this release. You can stream 1:30 of every track from the unreleased five hours at Soundcloud here, if you'd like to know what you're getting into:  soundcloud.com/coppice-halifax/deep-earth-year-one-compleat-bonus-5-hours",

      "about": "...EARTH 27 in the DEEP EARTH series...\n\n\n\nPasante tra la atingoj de ŝajne senfina spaco, la resonantaj linioj trenas la realecon mem al ĝia destinita celo. Antaŭ ĉi tiu akto, ne ekzistas antaŭe, nur nun. Nur ĉi tio. Nur estas. Jen, ni spertas la unuan post kiam iam ajn estis. La longaj eĥoj de tiu eksploda neevitebleco malrapidas sufiĉe por foriri, kaj en ilia regreso estas la unuaj sekundoj de la unua horo iam ajn. Tempo, dum tute senutila en tia stato, marŝas, kaj la universo, kiel ni scias, nun moviĝas nur antaŭen.",

La malrapida oscilado de tempo moviĝas tra la spaco de ĉio, koincidas en pli densajn sekciojn en iuj lokoj, kaj malrapidiĝas al la punkto preskaŭ ne ekzistanta en aliaj.

De la profundoj de la masaj oceanoj al la neĝaj krestaj mondopartoj, la mondo haltis. Se eble estus malŝpari ĉi tiun trompan sorĉon, nia patrino ne sciis ĝin, ĉar ŝi ankaŭ estis senprokraste kristaligita en vasta sistemo de metalaj ebonaj kaheloj, tute perfekte interligitaj en siaj geometriaj ŝablonoj kaj rigidaj linioj. Kio iam florenta kaj sovaĝa planedo estis nun malliberulo, enfermita en ĉi tiu fremda ŝelo, kiu servis aliflanke, nia granda patrino neniam scias. La perfektaj nigraj pecoj multiĝis en la miliardoj, elĉerpante kaj forkaptis la mondon per sia malhumila silento, ĝis ĉio, kio povis vidi, estis netaŭga nigra sfero. Ĉi tiu malsana surfaco nur reflektis la lumon de la varma flava stelo, kiu iam nutris la aferojn, kiuj tie loĝis. Kaj tamen, kontraŭ ĉi tiu senespereco, io forpuŝis ĉi tiun asimiladon. Iuj aspektojn de nia verda patrino, enterigita profunde sub la metala ŝtono, oferante, kian vivon ĝi ankoraŭ konservis kontraŭ la plej simpla ago - rezisti, por postvivi. Nia tero ne mortis, sed anstataŭe estis nur devigita denove. Kaj tiel estis, ĉar ekde la ekstere de la mikrobiaj ligoj de la malluma fremda malliberejo, la mondo denove ekkreskis ankoraŭ unu, unu malgranda klingo de herbo samtempe. Tamen, ĉar la koro de nia patrino estis malliberigita, la vivo mem estis malrapida, malpliigita, malklara. Eble unu tagon, en la estonteco de la kosma kalendaro, eble la Patrina Tero povas disbati kaj digesti ĉi tiun putran kernon, liberigante sian veran vivon ... sed nun la nigra kaŝas sub ĉio, kroĉante la tutan mondon en ĝia marko, kaj vokante al homoj kun strangaj kantoj de scivolemo kaj kuraĝo, rigardante ilin iam ajn en la mallumon sub la surfaco, kie ili certe perdos iliajn mensojn, iliajn korpojn kaj iliajn animojn.",

Ĝi neniam komunikos aŭ deklaras intencon, ĉar nia universo estas nur oceano de bruo, sen traduko kaj sen diferenco. Ĉu ĝi serĉas eskapon? Sekureco? Regado? Ĉi tie kaj nun ĝi nur ŝajnas deziri nian mondon, lokon profunde ene de sia centro.

Spuroj postlasitaj de antaŭaj vojaĝoj, antaŭaj vojaĝantoj, lavitaj kiel ruboj sur marbordo, brulantaj la landon laŭ strangaj padronoj, kiuj ankoraŭ ne devas esti tie. Fameco kaj scivolemo restas la donaco kaj la kaptiĝo de nia aparta ekskurso. Ni neniam povas vere scii, sed ni neniam estas tute en la mallumo. Ĉi tie ege, kaj ĉi malproksime, hejme kaj la komforto, kiun ĝi alportas al la menso, ŝajnas neeble malproksimaj. Tamen, varma sento, konfido, lavas min, kaj kun ĝi nebula sento. La sento esti parolinta vortojn laŭte en malplena ĉambro, sed konsternita de la sono de via propra voĉo. Mia kapo doloras, kaj mi sentas min tiel laca.

      "about": "...EARTH 46 in YEAR FOUR of the DEEP EARTH series...\n\n\n\nHoroj pasas, eble eĉ tagoj. Tempo estas senfokusa ĉi tie. Eventuale, eble neeviteble, ni alvenos. Salutita de pordo kun stranga tenilo farita el glata nigra metalo kun trianguloj gravuritaj en ĝin. Estas truo, same stranga, kiel cirklo kun pluraj linioj etendiĝantaj eksteren de la centro. Ĉi-momente, ni reakiras konscion pri nia fizika korpo. Ĝi estas unu korpo, ĉu ne? Kaj ĝi staras ĉi tie, ĉe la fino de nekonata koridoro, en kostumo el plasto, ŝtofo kaj pecoj el metalo teksitaj tra vejnoj. Ni levas la manon, kaj vidas blankan ganton, tenantan nigran ŝlosilon el tiu sama nepara metalo. Ĝi frapas sur vitran kovrilon ĉirkaŭantan nian vizaĝon. Ni glitas la ŝlosilon sensone en la seruron. Vibranta tono ĉirkaŭas nin.",

      "about": "...EARTH 55 in YEAR FIVE of the DEEP EARTH series...\n\n\n\nEn la centro de lumjaroj de vibro, ĉe la fino de iu granda rivera fluo, kiu komenciĝis tiel malproksime en spaco kaj tempo, ke ĝi ĉesas ekzisti tra dilatado de tempo, troveblas kvieta trankvilo. Ĝi sentas neniun el la turbuleco de la vojaĝo, nur la alveno. Ĝi sentas neniun el la bruo, ĉar la surdiga etoso ĉirkaŭanta ĝin estos ĉio, kion ĝi iam ajn scias. En ĉi tiuj aferoj, ĝi fariĝos la unua el speco de vivo, kiu nur povus iam vivi kaj spiri laŭ ĉi tiu aranĝo de atomoj, eroj kaj elementoj. Ĝi gestos kaj kreskos, gvidate de la mano de gravito, per la senmova tiro de iu blinda suno, kiu ne konas la pasaĝeron, kiun ĝi nun gardas. Ene de ĉi tiu din, ĉi tiu nova normalo, tra la silento de bruo kaj trans la sojlon de maldika membrano, komencas pulsi, eluzante la dronantan korbaton de provinco, kiun ĝi neniam memoros.",

      "about": "...EARTH 51 in YEAR FIVE of the DEEP EARTH series...\n\n\n\nEventuale la varma ardo de formoj traklaj kun lumo amasiĝas en densan kampon de hela blanka. Eniranta en maron de unu sola koloro, fariĝas evidente, ke blanka same povas esti nigra aŭ griza aŭ iu ajn alia koloro - egale, ĉiuj fariĝas abismo kiam estas nenio alia kontraŭ ĝi. Mi pensas pri la grizaĵo, kaj mi trovas, ke la tute-blankulo povas tiel facile fariĝi tute-griza nur ŝanĝante mian interpretadon de tio, kion mi vidas. Mi ekprenas la ideon, ke ju pli mi faras tion, des pli pripensas mia ena menso mia ĉirkaŭaĵo. Iel la grizo sentas sin pli speciala. Provizora gradiga spaco inter la blankaj kaj la nigraj ekstremoj. Iom post iom ŝanĝo implicas movadon, movo implicas ne-statikan spacon, kaj mi identigas mian pozicion kiel ene de oscilado de unu polo al alia. Mi atingas plu, pendante ĉi tiun liminalan staton, kaj ju pli mi enfokusigas mian vizion sur ĝi, des pli mi sentas, ke malproksima reago reaperas. Ĉi-foje, mi estas pli proksima al la fonto de ĝi. Mi estas la fonto de ĝi. Ĉiu movado de mia etendita mano levas tonon, ŝanĝas oftecon, vibras tuŝante la fantomon de mia pripensado.",

Vi estas ĉi tie, farante la samajn demandojn, kiujn vi faris antaŭ longe, kaj kvazaŭ ĝi scias kaj respondas, la spaco ĉirkaŭ vi ripetas ĝin. Ne kiel vi diris ĝin ĉi-foje, sed kiel krakanta senmova dronita mesaĝo, kiu atendis ŝajnajn eonojn por manifesti denove. Vi estas la mesaĝisto ambaŭflanke, perante kaj komunikante tra spaco tiel ampleksa, ke ĝi ne mezureblas laŭ longo, larĝo aŭ profundo, sed tempo. Iel, vi konscias pri ambaŭ perspektivoj, memoro estas strange amuza tiel, kondamnita ekzisti por ĉiam en la analoj de via menso, transformante kaj distordante sin ĉiufoje kiam ĝi bobelas reen al la surfaco.",

      "about": "To cap off the first year of Deep Earth, I felt it appropriate to create a milemarker/bookend-type release that illustrated the full range of the series. Unuopaĵojn / Singles is a double-album set that collects all seven of the video singles from the EKRANO catalog, as well as a wealth of alternative versions of those tracks and session outtakes from throughout the year. Musically, it is both louder and harder than much of the Deep Earth catalog, and also softer and far more restrained. Unuopaĵojn vacillates between extreme moments of blinding bright whites and subterranean high-pressure darknesses. While showcasing the variance of the series, it also provides a waypoint for what is yet to come.",

Okazas, kiel ĝi ĉiam faras, kaj la ripeto de ĉi tiu milda kolizio, kiel stranga perforta interparolo inter ĉielaj korpoj, rompas la muron, dividante ĝin kun anticlimactika neevitebleco.

      "about": "The MM14-FX album is a collection of fifteen longform CH tracks that were partially brought into existence via the Nady MM-14FX battery-powered 4-channel mixer, which also has a handy analog-like delay built into it. The Nady is a constant in my setup, because it can be used to mix out of a suitcase with a 100% battery powered hardware rig, and the delay aspect of it is incredibly versatile for running in an auxiliary send loop on my main studio board. Before I moved to Ohio, my first Nady unit burned out - literally: I'm not an engineer or a very handy person with repairing electronics, so all I can say is that it suddenly stopped working and briefly smelled of smoke. I replaced the unit, but for some reason, took the broken one with me to Ohio, where it was unpacked in the new White Pillar Workshop space. I'm not sure why I didn't throw it away - perhaps I thought I might attempt to repair it? Or maybe it just felt dear enough that I couldn't bear to think of it in the trash. Or, on a deeper level, I was waiting until the right time to give this rugged unit the respect it deserved, as I am doing with it here and now. I thought it was strange at first, but why not? Other musicians dedicate entire releases to synthesizers, drum machines, effects boxes...why not a reliable little mixer? After all, the Nady's simplicity is no doubt responsible for shaping much of these Halifaxian pastures into what they are. Sometimes, the notion of having less options and less flexibility just reinforces the need to make things that sound good in other ways, and I think that is precisely where this little unit succeeds. As such, I've assembled this 3xCD shrine around the burned out box, filled to the brim with music that once ran through it like hot techno blood, revealing one of the dozens (if not hundreds) of threads that connect every CH release to every other one like a massive system of streams, tributaries, rivers, oceans...",

      "about": "In addition to the release of SEAS 2, the original SEAS album from Expanding Electronic Diversity in 2009 (long since out of print) has been reissued in a standard CD-R version, containing all four tracks from the album as well as \"Blue Dub\", the vinyl-only b-side from the Arctic/Blue Dub 12\" (also out of print). For those unfamiliar, SEAS is the third collaborative project between David Tagg and Brian Grainger, and this debut album contains the duo's special brand of dub/ambient influenced techno blended intimately over snowed-in atmospheres of winter waves, cool blue wind and crisp clean textures. Influences include Basic Channel/Rhythm & Sound, Yagya, DeepChord, Vladislav Delay, Porter Ricks and The Orb, and these recordings would also appeal to fans of Brian's work as Coppice Halifax.\n\n\n\nThis definitive reissue comes packaged in a high-gloss mini-LP style cardboard jacket with a factory pressed CD-R inside. A bundle option exists in the SEAS store for buyers interested in ordering SEAS and SEAS 2 at the same time.\n\n\n\nAll orders for SEAS will ship on (or before) September 12, 2012.",

      "about": "Every year, I always have lots of new ideas for holiday-appropriate recordings, and most years, I simply run out of time to complete them. This year, I resolved to work on some of these ideas once and for all, and Blue Vale is one such recording. \n\n\n\nPicking up where Ferrolog leaves off, with a Yamaha RX21L drum machine (processed into a mutant techno pulse) anchoring an exploration vessel in a frozen sea of white noise, cold blue chords and empty Winter spaces. Aside from the aforementioned drum machine, the only other source of sound on Blue Vale is an LP of Christmas music played via music boxes, elongated/processed through a Gemini PDT-6000 turntable and the White Pillar hardware rig, including three Moog FX units, Alesis Quadraverb, Pioneer spring reverb, multiple analog filters (Steiner-Parker, MS-20, Digitech, Akai Variwah, in different successions as well as blended) and multiple analog/digital delays from Danelectro, BBE and Boss. The texture-rich final mix was channeled through the vintage circuits and signal paths of a JVC KD-A11 cassette deck, with tasteful software cleanup in post. \n\n\n\nNot completely a \"Christmas record\" by any definition of the term, but rather, a psychedelic meditation on Winter snowfall, filling up the valley behind my studio. Submarine scanner pings in the cold darkness, marking hints of a massive landscape like distant flares intermittently falling, while a lost crew of naval explorers begin to part with reality from exposure and isolation, beating a warm drum to keep the blood flowing...",

      "about": "Following 2015's GREEN SHAPE and 2017's GREEN SHAPE II, albums that grew majestic forestial structures out of composted recordings of holiday traditionals, set against an ever-shifting framework of drum machines...comes the double-album GREEN SHAPE III, the latest and perhaps deepest iteration of the concept.\n\n\n\nWhile the first two volumes sampled Xmas music box recordings from vinyl sides to generate their voices, Green Shape III reshapes the sounds of German metal bells, ringing out traditional Christmas songs, into a deep green Halifaxian Winter forest. Since the first Green Shape album, these recordings have taken on the role of being a sort of spiritual successor to the Verdant Acre series. The approach to the sessions is the same - a vinyl side (sent through numerous hardware filters/reverbs/delays/pitch processors and more) is carefully aligned with between one and three drum machines (in this case, a Yamaha RX11) and a bass synthesizer (a Korg Volca Kick) rounds out the mix's low end. On a handful of tracks, the Grass C-TCM and Korg MS-20 were used as white noise generators, to help widen the stereo field and fill out some of the blank space in the slower sparser moments.\n\n\n\n2018's sessions for Green Shape have yielded, by far, the most material yet to come from the Green Shape approach - over two hours, plus another subsequent \"Green Shade\" session that was intended to further/furthur space apart the filter passes and LFO sweeps to create three longform suites (  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shade  ). The final of these sessions became an extended deep listening experience that lasted over 82 minutes, and has itself been given a solo release with some slight runtime editing: (  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/gs-3a3x  ). \n\n\n\nAdditionally, a five-disc boxed set has been produced, limited in print number, that collects Green Shape I / II / III and the Green Shade session as a bonus 5th disc - the definitive sonic object to keep you tranquil and warmly contented through this stressful holiday season: (  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/green-shape-complete-sessions-i-ii-iii  )",

      "about": "Collected for the first time, the complete recording sessions for the first, second and third Green Shape albums, plus the supplemental Green Shade album. Five discs of deep ambient and dub techno music, cast in hues of forestial green and ocean water emerald. Composted holiday vinyl sides, processed in a similar fashion as the Verdant Acre series, over/under drum machines and sub bass sequences. With no clear provenance, beyond the vaguely recalled Dripping Earth pastorals, Green Shape manifests in the form of 30 different phases, each a mutation of the last. \n\n\n\nAlso included as digital extras are the GS-3A3X session (an extended and unedited original mix of GS-3A3) as well as the Radialtone mix of Phase #v (which previously appeared on the Filtered Artifacts 2xCD set of alternate mixes). An expansive and exploratory tableaux of Halifaxian pulse, hum and shimmer for the Winter season.",

      "about": "After finishing the session for Green Shape III, enough raw material remained to draft an unexpected second pass, allowing these three extended 'inversions' to happen. Using the same provenance of the Green Shape III album, Green Shade further transfigures those sounds by way of glacially slow tempos and additional tape looping/filter/pitch manipulation. Not quite Green Shape anymore, but not quite a totally new vessel either - it felt appropriate to issue these recordings as extensions of the main album recordings. They inhabit a similar space as releases like Fissured Beach, Reflector, Verdant Overgrowth and Lowlights.\n\n\n\nFurther, the third inversion presented here is an edit of a much longer piece, which finished the Green Shape sessions for good after running on late into the evening. The complete extended mix of GS-3A3 has been issued here for those who like to explore the bottommost depths of these green Halifaxian seas:  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/gs-3a3x",

      "about": "Green Shape is a single-session recording of ten variations on a theme, the central focus being on the lovely evergreens that populate the American landscape at this time of year. Impressionistic smears of fragrant green sound, pushed through warm pipes and across cozy carpets. The tools used this time around were two vinyl LPs of Christmas music boxes, composted and processed via many different analog effects, and sculpted into pleasant forms to float over and under Yamaha RX11 and RY20 drum machines, and a Roland TR-626 drum machine as well. The lovely sound of vintage spring reverb, analog delay and two Moog filters complete the formula.",

      "about": "Christmas is known for being a time of bountiful pleasures to share with friends, family and those dear to us (gather near to us once more). 2017 has been a tough year for me, and for a lot of people, so I'm very happy to have Christmas here now, with the beautiful snowy Ohio weather I've inherited, and a new year right around the corner. To emphasize this seasonal happiness, I've really put in a lot of time and energy this year for holiday-friendly music. There's my 4xCD-R \"aural Yule Log\" album Ferrolog, my 3xCD-R ambient Milieu triptych Snowradius, my longform icewater expedition Blue Vale Snowdream and now, to cap it all off, Green Shape II - a follow-up recording to (you guessed it) the original Green Shape album, which was recorded using holiday vinyl LP sides and three drum machines to create a unique holiday techno album. \n\n\n\nGreen Shape II was recorded in much the same fashion, only this time the operative drum machines were a Yamaha RX11, Roland TR505 and TR626. A bit more techno and a little less ambient dub than the first volume, Green Shape II contains four extended romps through brisk fir forests, clad in warm pea coat with iced espresso in hand. There are moments that recall the Subtropix album, with bounding archs of chords over a dance beat, while some of the bassline work on this album brings to mind things like Ocean Lion and Snow Vessel. \n\n\n\nHopefully, everyone else can enjoy the holidays as much as I'm trying to this year, and it is my sincere wish that these new recordings bring joy, pleasure and contentment to everyone who needs a little more. Happy holidays from the White Pillar Workshop!",

      "about": "REISSUED! In celebration of the long-delayed and much-awaited OCEAN LION III, both OCEAN LION and OCEAN LION II are being given reissues in matching packaging, with updated album cover photography to make the whole set glow on your record shelf. Possibly THE tropical CH album, for many listeners out there - a landmark in the ever-expanding Halifaxian universe! Remember, it's not a lake - it's an ocean! \n\n\n\n\"Ocean Lion is the first of four planned albums to bear the title, wherein deep seascapes of dripping tropical atmosphere and droning ambient bliss coalesce with mid-fi drum work that could be a distant buoy, and dub-influenced basslines that wouldn't be out of place on a Casino Versus Japan record. This is music designed from the ground up to be endless, continually shifting in subtle variants while keeping things anchored to a minimal recording approach. Elegant, yet restrained, Ocean Lion builds psychedelic castles out of Henry Mancini tape loops (among other orchestral sound sources) and presents the listener with a sensual experience that brings the beach and the low tide right into your living room.\"\n\n\n\n-Milieu Music, 2008",

      "about": "The first Coppice Halifax full-length recording since 2008′s tropical-overdose Ocean Lion, Bedroom Carpet brings a much different vibe to the table. Largely ambient but not without some very beat-based tracks, Bedroom Carpet is very warm and humid with lots of sleepy-eyed melodies blipping across a thin line of tape hiss. Written and recorded using only two drum machines, an old Casio keyboard and a four-track tape deck, this is some of my most cozy, playful and analogue music ever made. Very heavily influenced by records like Cylob’s Cylobian Sunset, Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works II and the Melodies From Mars album, as well as things like Kinesthesia, Bochum Welt and even friends of mine Thisket and EOD.",

In celebration of the long-delayed and much-awaited OCEAN LION III, both OCEAN LION and OCEAN LION II are being given reissues in matching packaging, with updated album cover photography to make the whole set glow on your record shelf. A dripping wet fantasy vacation for your mind, and a precursor to PAWLEYS ISLAND in more ways than three. \n\n\n\n\"The second of four planned albums bearing the name Ocean Lion, Ocean Lion II (as it has been semi-officially named) takes the psychedelic tropical atmospheres of the previous OL album to even greater heights. OL II is a far more composed and deliberately assembled work, relying less on pure improvisation and more on well placed brushstrokes of chord and color. Dubby techno rhythm work and the trademark warm organ pedalbass flows beneath the waves of orchestral tape loops, shimmering chords and padlike ribbons of sadness, trailing off on the salty wind. Ocean Lion II is a blissful album of electronic detachment, perfect for sending your mind on a private island vacation, or a fantasy dream beneath blue waters.\"\n\n\n\n-Milieu Music, 2010",

      "about": "Narcotic Months, as the name suggests, is a series of works Brian recorded over about two years. Presented in three sections, it could be said that Narcotic Months' five pieces are really only one piece of music - created, reworked, stripped-down, rebuilt, renewed, transposed and reimagined over five different iterations. Rather than give this concept different titles that might allude to their recording dates or locations, Brian has opted to only imply the intended color of each piece in his titles. Musically, Narcotic Months is one of many projects (another being WR's Pacific Opal Hex) that were created and subsequently separated from a provenance of material known only as Whitehope, which may or may not ever be released. It bears many of the current trademarks of the Coppice Halifax sound palate, such as bubbly organic rhythms and spacious landscapes of reverb and delay, covered with textural rainfall and prismatic analog snow. Perhaps the most obvious influences on Narcotic Months would have been Pub and Vladislav Delay's earlier works, but there are also traces of things like early AFX and possibly even Brian's own work with David Tagg as the duo SEAS. Second edition of 50 copies on standard CD-R with two exclusive new bonus tracks (#6 and #7), packaged in clear plastic sleeves with optical illusion line-print inserts and custom ink stamping.",

      "about": "Halifaxian is a carefully constructed work that serves both as a minimal techno album, inspired by artists such as Plastikman, Maurizio, Studio 1, Motor and Pole, and a DJ tool, seamlessly mixed from track to track, with the first track playing at 140 beats-per-minute and each track following at exactly 1 BPM less. It was initially intended to tie together all of the Analog Botany series recordings in a Coppice Halifax live set (and this practice can be heard on Endless Acre) but by the end of the recording, Halifaxian had asserted itself as an album with its own identity. Keen listeners may recognize the wealth of CH drum sounds and loops at play here, along with many different applications of drum machine hardware that I have become so fond of through the years. Additionally, this album inadvertantly gave way to the creation of the Bike moniker, and looking back, there are certainly traces of primordial Bike in these recordings too.",

      "about": "In October of 2011, the massive concept double-album Pawleys Island was issued first on an intimate edition of 20 copies on 2x cassette tape. During the creation and recording of the Pawleys songs, I realized just how much love and expression I funneled into the melodies and composition, despite the album largely being carried in a very rhythmic techno-inspired vehicle. Taking these thoughts into consideration along with the fact that the nostalgic territories Pawleys mined were just as connected to records like Selected Ambient Works II, Walter Carlos' Sonic Seasonings and early orchestral influences like Satie and Debussy, it became clear to me that there was a beautiful ambient album hiding beneath the waves of Pawleys Island. Dedicating myself to the pursuit of such a notion, I began recording this album of ambient versions of Pawleys pieces somewhere near the last 1/4 of the recording sessions for the album proper.\n\n\n\nI think it is important to note that the songs on Inland By Night are not merely beatless counterparts of PI material, rather they are entirely their own identities, memories and locations. The movements from PI will no doubt be recognizable, although they are considerably altered in pace, processing, tone and color, and both sides have been backed by an assemblage of field recordings: the exact length of a car drive from the beach in Surfside to my father's home in rural Loris, complete with the subtle sounds of tire traction on pavement, layered carefully alongside recordings of the sun rising at dawn over a humid marsh. Inland By Night is an approximated reimagining of those same Pawleys Island memories. Stoned, worn out from a long night of work or partying (or both) and driving home in the early morning hours to sleep and dream of the blissful shores I would one day tread in my creative travels. So here we are, years later, together in longing for that same happy sleep.\n\n\n\n-BCG, 7/28/2012\n\n\n\n**Includes bonus Postscript cassette exclusive to this package only.\n\n***UPDATE: As of August 12th, 2012, the double-cassette version is completely sold out.

      "about": "Over two years in the making, Pawleys Island could be considered the quintessential Coppice Halifax album. Started in 2008, and built via a year-long sifting process which was the Analog Botany series in 2009, Pawleys is a potent double-album that collects everything about a specific time and place and bottles it up in stylish colorful glass jars. Conceptualized as a representation of Brian's experiences in and around the actual Pawleys Island, a marshy coastal location just outside of Myrtle Beach, where Brian grew up, these recordings are a wistful kind of sad nostalgia for good times and bad times too. Building sandcastles as a child, going on school field trips to learn about marsh wildlife, partying with friends as a teen. Poolhopping, playing shows, pancake houses, warped cassettes in the car stereo, romance, hurricanes, shitty jobs, driving 40 minutes one-way to get back home, alone, at 3 AM, doing 60 through lampless country roads, mildly stoned, deep inside SAW 85-92, Cosmic Thing and \"Kid For Today\", zooming from the coastline to the country. Pawleys Island is the summation of all of these things, and more...musically it could be considered an apex of Brian's work within the dub techno template, but with lots of additional influences and flavors mixed in as well. Pawleys Island is an album about the bliss you find in missing things, and the comfort in being sad.",

      "about": "An album that was recorded at the end of 2011, and originally intended for release with a label that I don't even think exists now, Night's Drunken Splendour is very much an epilogue to Verdant Acre. I've held off on releasing it until the weather was right, and now the weather is perfect for such an occasion. NDS inhabits an after-dark, alone in the forest of Twin Peaks kind of space. Curious, windy, a little paranoid and fearful even, while still embracing the minimal techno groundwork that underlines the wildly overgrown textures. A mostly seamless listen with tracks either subtly or jarringly transitioning into one another, NDS is a lengthy exploration of those haunted woods I mined so deeply back in 2010 and 2011. I'd even go so far as saying that the title track and the closing track are both pinnacles of the Verdant Acre sound and approach, so hopefully this album is a bit of a surprise for fans of the series. In short, NDS is deep, dark and dense foresty techno for crumbling Autumn weather, for travelers to hold close like a compass as they tumble out drunk and alone into the gaping maw of the woods' shadows on the way home.",

Fitful, broken, breathless sleep, observed and documented across two different nights, before being arranged and processed into both conventional rhythmic forms and overtonal smears of soft white noise. At this level, there are no dreams, only a panic-induced state where time stops (or does it simply slow down?) and you wake up feeling exhausted. A monument for the lost and wandering, forever gasping in the bright white darkness of humid rooms.",

Essentially, Spring Blend is the perfect doorway between the 2009 Analog Botany series (which has recently been reissued) and 2011's Dusk Versions album at Recycled Plastics (which was also recorded during this time). Inspired by the onset of Spring after the AB series drew to a close, the AB tracks Dusk, Dusk II and Mirror are treated to lovely lush reimaginings by such talents as Ohrwert, Axs, Quantec, Textural Being, Zzzzra and Grad_U, and bookended with two original pieces that both establish and close the colorful mood.",

These two pieces reflect more what was to come with the second Ocean Lion album (MMD007) with more arrangements present in the composition, rather than improvisation. Using samples of orchestral vinyl and electric guitar, these songs carry a melancholic mood that echoes the feeling of being at sea.",

      "about": "Using the field recordings harvested and processed for the Naked Sound Seventeen album (available at CO_RD Tapes here:  cordtapes.bandcamp.com/album/naked-sound-seventeen  ), Coppice Halifax distills down all of the colors, scents and sounds of a Carolinian Summer like crayon wax, and pours them out across rainsoaked drum machines, sunkissed synthesizers and (sub)tropical texture. \n\n\n\nMore than simply a remix companion to the Naked Sound recordings, Subtropix is a signpost planted on the Richland County line in Columbia, South Carolina - almost 600 miles away from the currently thriving White Pillar Workshop - where Botany Bay yielded crop after crop of Halifaxian fruit. A place where Summer lasts 9 months of the year, and the nearly constant 90-100 degree heat is only broken by torrential downpours. A land where nothing dries out completely, with shaggy green grass overtaking everything in the space of a week, while yard hoses and plastic furniture disappear beneath a blanket of mosquito and snake inhabited microforests. I brought my daughter home from the hospital to just such a place, and I left great old friends behind when I drove away, through the mountains, to the windy valley I now call home. \n\n\n\nThere's no regret, no going back - but there is always looking back, and feeling some sadness, and Subtropix is one of a few attempts to come to terms with no longer being a part of the place that I lived in for over thirty years. In all honesty, I was tired of it - the weather, the politics, the idea that raising a child down there might not be for the best - and that's why it was so important to get away. \n\n\n\nThe great thing about remembering things as an artist, however, is that you can remember things however you choose to, and when you write about those memories, you have carte blanche to disseminate the past at arm's length. Remorse and regret can become romance and resolution, the sour syrup of sadness becoming a bittersweet tincture you can pocket away until the time is right again. And each time you open that little bottle up, it's always a little sweeter. Reality blurs further and further out of reach as your recollections of recollections overwrite themselves again and again. The tangibility of memory itself is fluid and vaporous, like a VHS tape you have rewound and replayed too many times, so now the blips and tracking errors are just as much a part of the subject matter as the film itself. \n\n\n\nSo, with great glowing happiness I give you Subtropix - four vials of Summer memory perfume, filtered through a human brain for thirty-four years so that only the palatable remains, however dishonest that may be. If you can never truly revisit the past, then why not make that process more enjoyable? It takes some amount of distance to truly appreciate the view, so I've provided you with both here. Contented escapism for a time and place that so badly needs it.",

      "about": "Treader Versions is an EP collecting four early versions of the track Treader, which would later appear in yet another version on the self-titled Coppice Halifax album. These four versions were essentially a recording session that occurred in the gap between the self-titled sessions and the 1983 session, and were omitted from the album after the first version from the 2006 sessions proved to be a favorite. Musically, they are very emblematic of the CH sound in its genesis - compost-like compositions built from heavily processed loops and field recordings, with rhythmic elements that seem to rise from the bottom of a swamp. In 2008, a very limited edition physical pressing was produced, which quickly went out of print, remaining unavailable until this digital release, which contains updated artwork built from photographs taken for the self-titled Coppice Halifax album.",

      "about": "...PART THREE...\n\n\n\nIt's been six years since you left the island you found, and sailed back to civilization from there. You've almost forgotten what it was like, with all this time passing by, weathering the memory like wind and water. Yet, when you close your eyes, and lie down, you can begin to feel the sun on your cheeks and watch the phosphenes shift inside your mind's eye. It feels good, but it's still only pretend. So you make your mind up to take the time off, pack up your essentials and push off into the blue waves again, seeking that drifting sensation. You navigate there without a map, by feeling alone, and the closer you get the less you feel uncertain about it. After months of chasing down mirages, the scent of a bronze perfume fills the air. On the wavering horizon line, you can make out a thin dark crop of something. Is it a ship? Is it your imagination? Is it the island you have worked so hard to find again? As you ebb closer, you can clearly see it - a lone rocky beach lined with palm trees, leading up to a dense swath of forestation. An indescribable feeling of happiness fills you from head to toe - the warmth of contentment, greeting an old friend. returning home. The salty waves crash softly against your bow as you disembark, thrusting the metal anchor into the wet sand. As you stumble ashore, you can hardly believe what you see - your hammock hanging in front of your little cabin made of bamboo and driftwood, the body of your original lifeboat overturned and fashioned into a rooftop. Everything just as you left it, and how you hardly expected to ever return. Certainly, by the time you set out on your trek, you imagined the isle would have been consumed by the sea...and yet, here it is, and here we are. Both of us, all smiles and warm glow, happy to be together again. Let's stay a little while, rest and listen to the things we found in the ocean.",

      "about": "...PART TWO...\n\n\n\nIt's been six years since you left the island you found, and sailed back to civilization from there. You've almost forgotten what it was like, with all this time passing by, weathering the memory like wind and water. Yet, when you close your eyes, and lie down, you can begin to feel the sun on your cheeks and watch the phosphenes shift inside your mind's eye. It feels good, but it's still only pretend. So you make your mind up to take the time off, pack up your essentials and push off into the blue waves again, seeking that drifting sensation. You navigate there without a map, by feeling alone, and the closer you get the less you feel uncertain about it. After months of chasing down mirages, the scent of a bronze perfume fills the air. On the wavering horizon line, you can make out a thin dark crop of something. Is it a ship? Is it your imagination? Is it the island you have worked so hard to find again? As you ebb closer, you can clearly see it - a lone rocky beach lined with palm trees, leading up to a dense swath of forestation. An indescribable feeling of happiness fills you from head to toe - the warmth of contentment, greeting an old friend. returning home. The salty waves crash softly against your bow as you disembark, thrusting the metal anchor into the wet sand. As you stumble ashore, you can hardly believe what you see - your hammock hanging in front of your little cabin made of bamboo and driftwood, the body of your original lifeboat overturned and fashioned into a rooftop. Everything just as you left it, and how you hardly expected to ever return. Certainly, by the time you set out on your trek, you imagined the isle would have been consumed by the sea...and yet, here it is, and here we are. Both of us, all smiles and warm glow, happy to be together again. Let's stay a little while, rest and listen to the things we found in the ocean.",

      "about": "For 2017's approaching Winter season, I was interested in producing a musical work that could be considered the aural equivalent of the Yule Log - an object of reportedly mystical ability, that could protect households, bring luck and prosperity and...of course...keep your house warm too. In the holiday spirit of keeping warm and filled with contentment, I am happy to offer you the Coppice Halifax Ferrolog: five extended suites across four discs, brimming with warm blanket chords, windswept drones, wet leafpile textures, thick humming basslines and tight drum machine rhythms that pop and spatter like embers in a hearth. Sitting sonically somewhere between Ocean Lion, Reflector and Static Physics - with just a hint of modern tangents like Verdant Acre, Autochromata and Earthworks - Ferrolog is a slow-burn of deep and emotive ambient techno that will be a nice, reliable go-to as Autumn turns to Winter. Stay warm and happy!",

Painstakingly arranged and remastered with intimate listening environments in mind, Cmx III is a fresh and varied summation of where Coppice Halifax has been in the last five years. \n\n\n\nReleased in a recycled cardboard digipak with stickers and patterned cardstock inserts, on an edition of 50 copies. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, the first two (out of print) volumes of the Cmx series have been added to Bandcamp with new cover art to match this volume, available for the first time ever digitally.",

Opening with a Static Physics-era demo of Aeriformic Forests, Cmx VII quickly gives way to massive spaced out organic electronics with a previously unreleased mix of Nacht Plank's \"Birth\". From there, the Endless Oceans mix reintroduces soft melody and undulating rhythm one sweet step at a time, before the torrential downpour of Sleepless arrives. The album closes with an extended degraded cassette mix of the Nacht Plank remix, which turns the shades down on most of the first mix and points a light in other less explored corners...",

      "about": "The fifth volume in the ever-expanding cosmos of Coppice Halifax remixes, Cmx V contains eight tracks that fill your ears with 73 minutes of organic technoid forms and dense ambient forestry. Opening with \"Fisstech\", an unreleased track from the Leaf Cloak sessions, the album is off to a bubbly Analog Botany bounce from the start. The remixes that follow vary in sound from the gritty dub of the Textural Being mixes, to the low-end worshipping minimal techno of the Asymmetrical Head and Contemporary Vision mixes. Another unreleased cut, a CH remix of Phasen's \"Syy\" from 2010, ascends from the watery depths of the Analog Botany vaults, and finally the whole album gives way to the ambient techno gliding of the Myoplast remix and the beatless Nacht Plank remix, which was an absolute honor to make, as Lee Norris has been one of my musical heroes for years now.",

      "about": "Upon the reconsideration of Milieu's album Brother, which was recorded almost ten years ago, it occurred to me that I no longer held sacred anything about the music. It was created at a time and from a vantage point that no longer exists. So, with the recent reissue of Brother, which would not have even happened if it were not for numerous fan requests, I felt the need to do something personal that would re-validate the project for me. Like diving to a land mass that was once above sea level, revisiting Brother was a very raw and blindly explored process. I located all of the original master tapes from the archives and set upon them as if they were eroded artifacts that I would mutate in the same fashion as the Verdant Acre sessions. Lots of noisy analog delays and reverbs were employed, as well as two generations of cassette tape and one generation of reel to reel tape, and a single DR550 drum machine was included to anchor the murky excursion to some type of rhythmic floor. The result is essentially a new album, with each half of the Brother source material reduced/expanded to a nearly forty-minute experience. A forest wall, petrified and sunken to the bottom of a black sea, found by accident and lit up only sections at a time by a silent submersible. A blurry white shape in the darkness.",

      "about": "The sixth expansive volume of Coppice Halifax remixes, Cmx VI contains some of the deepest and dubbiest CH remixes yet. Kicking off with the pastoral \"Alluvion\", originally released on a compilation album at Grounded In Humanity, the collection moves seamlessly through the wall-of-sound psychedelics of the \"Psycho-Tropic Sex Cmx\" and the smoky downtuned dub of \"Settle\". The \"Asari Harem\" mix for Cybertone freshens things up with a smooth ambient house vibe, then \"Restored Picture\" puts the music in gritty techno mode. The final three tracks are almost a suite of deeply immersive dub techno with warm-bath drones peppered in, finishing out the set on a starry eyed dreamlike note.",

Cmx IV collects remixes commissioned for Zander One, Arbee, Ndru, Lamont Kohner and DeepWarmth, and pairs them with \"R³\", a track only previously issued on the digital compilation Futur[e]cho 2013 at Cold Fiction. Nearly 80 minutes of unmistakable Halifaxian groove work and textures, and an essential listen for anyone who enjoys tracing the lineage of various sounds through the CH repertoire. The trio of Zander One remixes (previously issued on the Blue Shape EP) and the Lamont Kohner remix are deep dub techno, while the Arbee remix wouldn't have been out of place on Narcotic Months. The DeepWarmth remix is pure Analog Botany dancefloor material, and the Ndru remix exhibits one of the rarer instances of totally minimalist CH. Varied, yet cohesive!",

      "about": "Solus is the spiritual follow-up to Reflector, an album of extended minimalist ambient techno released at Entropy Records in France. A full eighty minute exploration of barely-there sonic sculpture, transparently draped over a consistent bass drum rhythm that frames the piece. With Solus, empty space is the key element in the composition. This is an atmosphere that has been deliberately colored to enhance and accompany the sounds of the listener's momentary surroundings, be they an open window at night, the hum of an engine while riding in a car, birdsong on a sunny day, the crash of waves on a shoreline or the insistent drops of rain on a rooftop during a storm. Solus guides the listener through a sensation of movement, provided by the rhythmic pulse and gradual shifts in temperature of the backing drones and textures buried deep within it, making it the perfect companion for sleeping, reading, driving or simply placing on repeat play while you go about your daily routine in your home or office. Solus is wallpaper music, but it is also detailed enough to enforce its own shapes and shadows onto any wall. An adventure in sonic absence, a Rorschach inkblot for the mind to ponder and discover its own sense of balance, purpose and placement. \n\n\n\n***A limited edition CD-R version of Solus will be available in the coming weeks.",

Strains of sadness, disconnection and futility create shadows over Heavy Orbit's more melodic aspects, leaving the listener to meditate on the outcome of this doomed ship's fall from the sky.",

Ambient techno that is truly ambient by way of peeling away from the subject matter and viewing it aerially. Only from far distances are certain details observable.",

      "about": "SSP is an album that came together subconsciously. That is to say, while learning new pieces of hardware and experimenting with these devices both inside and outside of the studio, I accumulated a large amount of informal material. Upon closer inspection, much of it seemed to have a mind of its own, and I realized there was an album just waiting to be christened from the bits and pieces strewn across my tapes and hard drives. A few tracks are (perhaps obviously) outtakes from Deep Earth sessions, while others are both fresh and faceless in the way that only techno can be. There are also fascinating short tracks, which felt like cartilage to me - SSP is not without a sense of humor. Altogether, the album is inspired by things like Ovuca's Onclements and AFX's Analogue Bubblebath 3. More original than a mixtape, not quite cohesive enough to be a conceptual work. A pleasant hodgepodge to stimulate the senses and perhaps offer a renewed look at just what the hell I'm doing with all these machines in this tiny room. \n\n\n\nThere is a limited edition CD-R version of SSP, available to the general public, while a much more limited cassette version exists and is already making its way to a few unsuspecting mailboxes...",

      "about": "It's already been a year since the seventh installation of the Cmx series, so it should come as no surprise that there have been quite a few Coppice Halifax remix commissions in that time. For the eighth volume, I've assembled seven tracks that feel very at home with each other. Starting with the opening (previously unreleased) mix of \"Phern\", taken from the \"morning after\" Nepenthesol session, an immediate focus is drawn to melodic basslines, swirling flanger-soaked chords and propulsive drum machine rhythms. Following the vaguely house-like groove is the starry-eyed dub shuffle of aspect.'s \"bp4\", simmered down to a funk not unlike some of the Analog Botany series. The subtle house strain continues on my 11-minute rework of DeepWarmth's \"Crafting A Stream\", with delayed piano chords gently covering a bouncy and breezy deep techno mood, before the bottom drops out in Arbee's \"Vérosène\", during which a skeletal form made of sine-wave sinew and crisp amplifier hiss circles the drain and eventually dissolves. This emptiness gives way to the grand and glistening 17-minute mix of Zander One's \"Isolation\", filled with cascading paddy chords and buoyant hollowed out drums, floating serenely into a magic fog. By the time Melotone's \"In The Distance\" arrives, it's clear that the album is winding down again, with tape-processed vocal sounds and polite rhythms ebbing forward. Closing with the 20+ minute epic VSOP Dub of Brother Blue's \"Royal Secret\", the album has one last excursion for you to immerse yourself in. Warm, pooling drones and gradually rising chords build up to a dancefloor-ready techno funk that offers you one last push on the swing before the lights go out. \n\n\n\nConsidering the (to my ears) accessible nature of this volume, it's safe to assume that Cmx IX will be a much deeper, psychedelic affair. Once again, my remixes seem to have a life and mind of their own, and assemble into an album that is a greater whole than the sum of its parts. Hopefully you enjoy this collection as much as I do, as all the leaves fall off the trees and the cool evenings keep you tucked in.",

      "about": "Solus Variations is the result of my own excavation, extraction and repurposing of the gems I found while exploring Solus in my studio. Tangential processing techniques yielded deeper and more mutated results as the recording sessions continued. These seven pieces are themselves mirror images of Solus, albeit focusing on singular aspects of the original piece rather than the whole. You could even say that each \"variation\" is actually a segment of Solus, zoomed in on to a microscopic level, to reveal more intimate and engaging levels of detail that were deliberately avoided in the original piece. This is the sound of me taking Solus to different climates and exotic locales, applying it like a layer of paint over the landscape itself, then removing the landscape and examining the alien and organic shapes that remain. \n\n\n\nFor the intrepid listener, other possibilities may present themselves in the practice of playing these variations over/under Solus itself, creating a potentially endless and unique atmosphere tailored to your own listening needs. \n\n\n\n***A limited edition CD-R version of Solus Variations will be available in the coming weeks.",

      "about": "The second movement (or lack thereof) in the until-now-unannounced series of albums bearing the SOLUS designate, Solus 2 reports in 22 months after Solus departed our air space. Presently it is still possible to hear the kickdrum-like heartbeat throughout the transmission - a required element in this project, allowing the Botany Bay machines to accurately and intelligently decipher the data packets received from the Solus vessel, which by now has reached the area just outside of Jupiter, steering just close enough to remain safely outside of the red giant's gargantuan pull. Beneath the pulse, the true nature of Solus' explorations are revealed - strange tonalities and extended periods of resonant mid and upper range frequencies, punctuated occasionally by sounds that, were I to not know any better, would take for human speech. Interestingly, different elements of the recording itself can be perceived upon repeat listens, especially at different volume levels. The application of outside ambient and white noise is also illuminating, bringing out overtones that were otherwise invisible to the human ear. This strange aural phenomenon is almost totally unexplained, but the Solus initiative continues forward into space and into the future, embracing whatever (or whoever) may come.",

      "about": "Six excursions into the nervous system of Solus 2, each one a small universe, teeming with energies and unnamed forms of life. Variad continues in the path of Solus Variations, wherein new readings are found amongst the wreckage after demolishing the source vessel. As Solus 2 utilized a configuration of a Korg KPR-77 analog drum machine over/under a bed of tape loops in constant flux via the motion of elaborately connected and threshold-based FX unit, so too does Variad only use the original tape loops and the KPR-77 as the sole rhythmic sound generator. The pieces vary between eroded dancefloor memory slippage, windswept and alien planetary surfaces throbbing with the pulse of intense pressures and distant waves of 32-KBPS MP3 compression lapping up on abandoned marble-white shores. In these colorful yet barren realms, there is no true north, no days or nights, no familiarity anchoring you to your ship's lander, which is a very very long way from home.",

      "about": "Following the last iteration of the SOLUS recordings over two years ago, SOLUS 3 emerges from the void like a beam of alien light crossing cosmic expanses over eons. \n\n\n\nFor those who don't yet know, Solus recordings are created using a simple rule: Rhythmic elements and possibly a bass element are mixed to the absolute forefront, while all things tonal and textural are reduced to between 5-20% of the volume of the rhythms. This is an experimental approach that somewhat embodies a techno variant of Eno's original ideas regarding ambient music - where composed sound could exist harmoniously in the background, right below the threshold of awareness, allowing for a kind of Rorschach effect of the ear, hearing overtones and patterns where there may have been none. Solus recordings apply this thinking to a minimal techno template, where Coppice Halifax supplies the rhythmic components, and the incidental sounds/overtones of the just-out-of-reach atmospheric elements in the piece provide the impetus for the listener's brain to find anchors in the sonic freefall. \n\n\n\nSo, it follows that Solus 3 is designed for playing alongside all manner of external interference, such as open windows, appliances, radio fuzz, a TV in another room, vehicles passing by or even the reverberations of the playback in the listening space itself. All of these, and more, are completely canonical elements of the work, thereby creating a totally different playback experience every single time. \n\n\n\nThis third Solus recording was improvised live on outboard hardware in the White Pillar Workshop, and broadcast to the members of the Milieu Music Fan Club, on September 9th, 2018. All sounds were generated using a MIDI-free hardware rig of: Korg Minilogue / MS-20 / Volca Beats / Volca Bass / Volca Keys / Volca Sample, Arturia Microbrute, Roland SH-32, Grass C-TCM and AM radio band processed via Moog LPF/Ringmod/MIDI-MuRF, BBE Two Timer, Boss RV-3, Synthrotek PT2399, Pioneer SR202W, Alesis Quadraverb and 2x DSP patches in the Peavey FX2 24-channel mixing board. \n\n\n\nAs with the first two volumes of Solus recordings, there is also a collection of alternate mixes/versions/variants drafted as a companion piece to this release, fulfilling the second aspect of the Solus ethos: Using only the singular source of the original recording to isolate and arrange new tracks, thereby utilizing the atmospheric content as a primary \"lead\" voice, despite the fact that very little emphasis has been placed on the creation of those sounds.",

These two extended drifts are from the six-years-deep sessions for Ocean Lion III, and offer a soft epilogue to the monumental triple-disc affair. While Lioness II represents closure for this volume of Ocean Lion, by no means is it a denouement. There is still more to come, hopefully next year, in a new summer, remembering these same waves.",

      "about": "The twelfth volume of the ongoing Cmx series of remix compilations arrives just in time for spring, with 75 minutes of CH composting for your ears. \n\n\n\nOpening with the customary CH track to lead the way, we start with \"Radioeye 22\", an unreleased alternative mix of \"Radioeye 20\", which was itself released on a compilation at Data Network, Ukraine. From there, we progress slowly into a bubbling ambient techno field, with an unreleased remix for Alternating Queues, drafted during the mastering of his excellent Hand Sines album (Recycled Plastics). The AQ mix leans in and out of a bleepy coda, and brings us into the droning techno bounce of the Passage remix. Commissioned for the expansive Worked On album at Illuminated Paths, this mix was so warm and comforting that I nearly passed out in the studio finishing it. Next, we have the huge and almost beatless shoegaze bliss-out of \"Albatross\", a rare remix commissioned by a band (Jetman Jet Team) instead of a solo artist, that has been floating around the web without any kind of proper release. This mix pulses and throbs through a deep blue haze, relying mostly on an omnipresent bassline to carry everything else above it. The rhythms pick back up on \"Temperature Inversion\", a minimal dub techno rephrase of a track from Anders Peterson's Skyscaper project, which until now has also remained unreleased. The next mix, the shortest piece of the remix lot, is the previously unreleased mix of Royce Allen's \"She Cried\", which was a sporadic side-effect of mastering Allen's EP in 2014. This mix is a strange coalescing of irregular percussive forms and shuddering, wet grey shapes, draped over a wobbling structure that never quite holds itself upright. The closing piece, a 16 minute creep out for COAL's Infested release in 2016, slowly lurches forward through ring-modulated dub chords, distant tangles of tonal atmospheres and skeletal drums. A dark, yet suitably expansive, curtain to pull across a varied set of remix works. \n\n\n\nAltogether, as always, the Cmx volumes seem to flow intuitively in and out of themselves, as if they were albums in their own right long before I considered them as such. Hopefully, this tableaux of reconstructions stands alone as a Halifaxian landmark, while also paying appropriate tribute to the original artists' works. Every remix on this release was created using a strict system of employing only the original source sound, with no sounds of my own added during the remix process.",

      "about": "The eleventh volume of the mountainous Cmx series, which collects Coppice Halifax remix works and sequences them into coherent album-like entities. This volume opens with a unique track commissioned by Always Human Tapes for their concept-compilation cassette \"Mount Real - Music To The Motion Picture\" - bearing the name Lioness, this piece meanders and slowly blooms across almost nine minutes, and is built almost entirely out of samples from a number of vinyl sides from Loretta Lynn, Simon & Garfunkel, M.I.A. and Buffalo Springfield.\n\n\n\nFollowing Lioness is a previously unreleased remix for Cetra, a Scottish musician perhaps better known as Mosca, which undulates with heavy synth chords and a Kompakt-like schaffel beat. The club vibe fully emerges on the \"Circuit Burst\" mix of Nntblst's Risset Overtones, a heavy dancefloor locomotive, bubbling over with white noise sweeps, spastic arps and hollowed out acid bass. After the workout is over, the chillout tent centerpiece Screener36 remix creeps in - sounding perhaps closer to early Aphex Twin than any other CH track to date. In the wake of the ambient techno bliss-out, the eleven minute \"Live In The Dark Room\" mix for Oxynucid's acid techno romp subtly invades the space, stripping back Oxynucid's harsh analog arps and pounding rhythms and melting them down into a smooth smoky dub. With nowhere left to go, the bottom drops out with a 17 minute Magic Arrows remix, swirling and psychedelic with spattered guitars and clouds of melody everywhere, until a slow tropical bassline anchored to a head-nod break drives us home. This closing piece should also not-so-delicately hint at what is to be expected from Peppermint Carousels, the soon to be debuted collaboration between Magic Arrows and Coppice Halifax. \n\n\n\nAltogether, a vibrant trip through sound fields both Halifaxian and foreign, which is what the Cmx albums continue to so effectively communicate. Remixing remains one of the most stimulating challenges for my studio, and I'm always content to hear the returns this series yields over the years.",

      "about": "Fittingly, alongside the 10th anniversary VAPORIZED FOREST INDEX album, we've also arrived at the tenth volume of the Cmx remix catalog. Considering this, it only felt appropriate to use this volume to make a counterpart for V.F.I., highlighting some of my favorite CH remixes from the last decade. \n\n\n\nRemixes for many other producers are often seen as trivial, promotional things, something you do to fill out a single or try and appeal to a club-going contingent with music that might otherwise stay out of such a setting. For me, remixing has always been one of my favorite studio activities, a way to momentarily see how sharp you can get with a single track, and someone else's source material. I have taken a more challenging approach to remixes as well, in that I do not use any of my own sounds in the tracks I produce - only things present in the original artist's piece. This process means a constant learning curve with sound design and FX processing, as well as creative mixing and sequencing work, in order to create a mix that is both faithful to the original music and adherent to my own sonic principles, and what I'd like to say in that moment. You might think such a stance would yield less melodic results, but in that case it becomes the opposite, most of the time - in becoming so intimate with the source sounds, new melodies and chord progressions are exhumed and an honest, valid reinterpretation of someone else's composition takes place. \n\n\n\nSo for Cmx X, I picked seventeen of my favorite remixes, and with some preparatory work, I performed and recorded a DJ set using only those pieces. A constantly flowing and fluctuating seamless collection of all kinds of techno, ambient and braindance mixes, psychedelic and focused on the groove. With this, I offer a 10th anniversary Remix Appendix, and raise my glass to all of the many producers I've produced mixes for: Here's to ten more years of Coppice Halifax transmutations!",

In some respects, the supporting material issued here is a softer approach to that tape-worn Halifaxian sound (found elsewhere on Ocean Lion, Pawleys Island and High Hawaiian Fog), whereas the second Sun Cast side presents a more aggressive tack - well, about as aggressive as 30-minute stoned and droned beach jams can get. A fitting encore to the massive Sun Cast trip, which is now over - or is it? \n\n\n\nAdditionally, a video has been assembled for Hightide Crush, and you can watch it here:  youtu.be/cqAcVjgIxDk",

      "about": "Recorded in August 2016, right before I moved 600 miles from the subtropics, Window Cill was essentially the first take of the composition that would become Cillage on the CH section of the Sun Cast triple-album. While it conveys a totally different soundworld, melodically, one can see parallels in my producer's approach, with the long slow burn of chopped breaks building up, swirling chords coating the rhythm like a psychedelic fog and an elasticizing of time to further disorient the listener. In the end, it was redone entirely with a larger focus on the orchestral sampling that fills out Cillage, and this cut was left off of both Sun Cast and the subsequent singles due to its considerable length. Finally, Spring has arrived in the valley and Window Cill feels like the perfect thing to cast out into the air. This is one to be taken with you when you go, and played as loud as possible.",

      "about": "As with the first two volumes of Solus recordings, Solus 3 has generated a companion release of alternate versions. Transfiguring Solus 3 into five totally different macrocosms of sonic space, 333/SOL fulfills the second aspect of the Solus ethos: Using only the singular source of the original recording to isolate and arrange new tracks, thereby utilizing the atmospheric content as a primary \"lead\" voice, despite the fact that very little emphasis has been placed on the creation of those sounds. This process allows subconscious design decisions to bubble up to the top, inevitably turning out unique and mutant music that is adherent to no real template or convention. 333/SOL is, topically speaking, a thick and organic techno record that dips its toe into drone and dub pools with total alien indifference. It would likely appeal to listeners who enjoyed albums like Chloroformic Forests, Photovoltaic Fragments, Somx, Cornucopiad and Eluvian II, and feels perfectly suited to the current chilly Autumn that's blowing through the Miami River valley.",

This mammoth piece of psychedelic techno has been constructed by Nemo (aka The Nautilus Project) & Jaymon, using the entirety of the first year of Deep Earth's catalog as sound source, along with various devices from the Forest Roots studio and field recordings Nemo & Jaymon have captured in their extensive travels. It represents a true meeting of the minds, coalescing like a gigantic fog that hangs above South Carolina and Germany in tandem, and it also begins a Deep Earth catalog subset called Ripetis, or \"Reiterated\", which will serve as a vessel for Deep Earth reconstructions, remix works and excavations by external producers and studios.",

      "about": "The second release in the RIPETIS / REITERATED catalog of remixes and reconfigurations is ALKEMIISTO, a nine-track collection of selected remix approaches to Deep Earth by five of the most talented musicians I have the pleasure to know. Zwei Kreise, known previously as Axs, appears twice with a beat-based mix of Vintro and a beatless mix of Malaperis. Two of the denser mixes on ALKEMIISTO come from aural sculptor Arjen Schat, also known as Ohrwert. Fah appears here under his less-used Ambigen moniker, contributing two atmospheric pieces created with his custom-designed generative ambient software. Perhaps the most conventional sounding of all the mixes is the EARTH 4 reconstitution Cielarkus, courtesy of The Green Kingdom, while the album closes with a nearly half-hour excursion into Vintro by Orson Throb. An appropriate counterpoint to the year's fruits in the series, and a solid full-length album of deep and experimental techno works by some of the best minds in the market today.",

COAL and CH embark on an improvisational live session, rearranging and remixing OKAZI at the molecular level. The session yielded five distinct sections, culled from a very stream of consciousness performance process. The album moves through waves of drone, thick delay-spattered dub rhythms, pulses of bass textures and floor stomping techno, finishing with a lengthy meandering suite of ambient pings and resonant filter surfing. Part live perfomance, part remix, this \"embodied\" version of Okazi pairs well with the second year of the DEEP EARTH series.",

Two volumes of Deep Earth remixes and reconstructions by the prolific Kostas Staikos, known better to the listening world as SUBSTAK. These 11 pieces are both subtle and drastic, sometimes shifting the rhythmic emphasis around, or coaxing out different harmonies with filters, and other times being completely mutated in Kostas' hands. Altogether they represent a very hi-fi listening experience, superb on headphones and heavy duty sound systems that can convey deep bass without distortion.",

      "about": "The third issue in the RIPETIS / REITERATED series comes in two halves. Two volumes of Deep Earth remixes and reconstructions by the prolific Kostas Staikos, known better to the listening world as SUBSTAK. These 8 pieces are both subtle and drastic, sometimes shifting the rhythmic emphasis around, or coaxing out different harmonies with filters, and other times being completely mutated in Kostas' hands. Altogether they represent a very hi-fi listening experience, superb on headphones and heavy duty sound systems that can convey deep bass without distortion.",

      "about": "Aeriformic Forests is a massive, undulating tapestry of sound, recorded during the Static Pharming sessions earlier in the year. A lengthy excursion into vaguely-rhythmic ambient dub, comprised of dozens of different tape loops and synth layers that meander around the stereo field, sporadically evaporating and then dripping back down on the humming bass foundation like rain. Walls of translucent light overlap to form floating pools of colors, while the womblike percussion isn't in a hurry to go anywhere. In this way, A.F. is simply and literally a document of Static Pharming - music created for aesthetic and impressionist values, rather than compositional movement. Wallpaper music for the dub techno crowd, you could say, and not too distantly related to other CH works such as Reflector or some of the Verdant Acre recordings. While this recording is available as a bonus disc inside the 5xCD Static Pharming: Year One box set, it has been made available here in a singular edition for the listeners who have already purchased all of the Static Pharming material separately.",

      "about": "The second EP of the 2014 Static Pharming series is the open skied sonic expanse Outpost. Rolling grey chords mutated from Bedrich Smetana's orchestral impressionism pour out from heavy clouds and distant thunder, and a lurching rhythm appears beneath the shadows. Slowly, the desert sky opens up and cold rain touches down on the cracked sepia rock and sand. In an abandoned building not far away, a broken radio receiver spills static and fuzz into the airwaves, and a pronounced kick drum drops from the storm, using a single note of bass as its counterpoint. By the end of this excursion, the washes of rainy sheets of sad string drones hit a critical mass, and a sparse organ melody appears inside the wetness, bringing the sunshine out and driving the grey clouds away.",

      "about": "It isn't often I run a year-long series, and finish it, and then decide to keep going. Usually, I feel that an EP a month for a year is enough to really rinse out whatever idea I had at the beginning, and that maybe I will revisit it later on once I get some new ideas to apply to the project. Static Pharming is the first series I've started that I felt was only beginning to come into its own, and pick up proper momentum, by the time the 12th month rolled in. Perhaps it is the ever-expanding and tangential aspect of Coppice Halifax as a project now, perhaps I'm just addicted to getting lost in my own forests. So, with RX13, I'm raising my glass to all of you - here's to another year of Pharming!\n\n\n\nGemstones In Ice, as RX13, is a vibrant piece that was equally inspired by the winter cold and by the brilliant cv313 material that my friend Mr. Hitchell was sharing with me when I recorded it. Romping drums, copious amounts of white noise and delay artifacts, heavy use of filters and reverbs and of course thick bass figures that help punctuate the motorik rhythm. It's a feelgood slice of Analog Botany that is meant to jump start the second year of Static Pharming in a playful way. Press play, open your ears and let it wrap around you!",

      "about": "Somewhere between things like Verdant Acre and High Hawaiian Fog sits High Lights, the 18th EP in the Static Pharming series. Exploring the sadder side of ambient techno, High Lights focuses on the slow expansion and contraction of orchestral tape loops, ghosting over a subtle dubby rhythm and bass section. String sections play blue notes endlessly into a space echo chamber, while singled out violin leads wrap like thin wire around wooden barrels, floating out to sea long after the ship that carried them went to sleep beneath the waves.",

      "about": "Orange canyon walls of weathered stone, warm with sun. Steep faces of rock surrounded on all sides by a calm blue ocean. Several other small islands are visible nearby, all connected via metal rail bridges. Further off in the distance, a storm begins to gather, prompting you to take shelter in one of several strange looking metallic hemispheres. Realizing there is no power to any of the machines, you begin the slow task of working out some repairs. Your search for replacement parts leads you to a massive airship, which only needs electricity to provide passage away from the remote island. Continuing your effort, you find a small dimly lit cave area with some workbenches, tools and - best of all - blueprints. In no time flat, you have made the necessary changes and within seconds, the island buzzes to life, powered by solar panels you have only now noticed. You happily board the airship, which is now humming comfortably with machine programmed confidence, and set the controls for the heart of the sun.",

At first their burbling waters appear to be clear, then vaguely prismatic - like blowing bubbles - until you begin to realize that they are not water at all, but impossibly endless lines of cassette tape ribbon, reflecting all manner of silver and white from the sunny bright sky above you. Or is it below you? Is this a meadow at all? It starts to feel more like a warm carpet, actually, and that bright sunshine is just a ceiling lamp. Coming back to reality you begin to understand the full effect of your sleep deprivation: a wooden table nearby is filled with several small machines covered in blinking lights, and a black speaker below them belts out a hypnotic rhythm. Beside the machines is a reel to reel which has somehow gone wildly off track, steadily unspooling tape for however long you've been out of it. Maybe twenty minutes? You can't find a clock anywhere, but the reel is nearly exhausted. You pick up the box the reel must've been in - Haddaway's single for \"What Is Love?\". Man, weird night.",

      "about": "Bookending a year very full with Halifaxian works is this five-disc volume of Static Pharming, containing all 12 EPs created throughout 2013, as well as a special new album - Aeriformic Forests - recorded during the Pharming sessions and given a rightful place here. Static Pharming was intended initially to be a single-year series, however the series is now continuing on for a second year in 2014, after I made the realization that things were just starting to become self-aware, conceptually and aurally. From the icy peaks of pieces like \"Empty\" and the rainslick metallics of \"Natow\" to the blue skies of \"Enhasa\" and the deep blue oceans of \"D.Y.B.\", Static Pharming has transmuted thought to function, function to form in an ever-mutating process of live improvisation, spur of the moment drum programming and rigorous FX saturation, yielding music that is equal parts drone, dub techno and textural ambient. All the hallmarks of the CH sound are clear and accounted for, and the thick woods of Verdant Acre can still be seen from the Static shore. The composting, excavation and Analog Botany alchemy will hereafter continue to expand and explore, but for now, this pillar marks a 12-month descent through nitrous oxide clouds and sedate waters, collected conveniently in one place for the adventurous listener.\n\n\n\n\"He must go on - conquest beyond conquest. This little planet and its winds and ways, and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about him, and at last out across immensity to the stars. And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time - still he will be beginning...\"\n\n\n\n- O. Cabal, 2036",

      "about": "September brings cooler air and shorter days, a welcome respite from the oppressive heat of each Carolinian sub-tropical summer. Appropriately, the ninth RX of the year is a cool, dusky sweep of burnt leaves and deep golden hues of setting sunlight, all carried fragrantly along on a light breeze that curves in the purple air like invisible poetry. A wondrous calm surrounds the listener with gently bubbling hi hats and AM radio fizzed chord stabs, while the last remnant of a house bassline repeats lazily in a lock-groove. \n\n\n\n\"Will the wind ever remember the names it has blown in the past?\"\n\n-J.A. Hendrix, 1967",

Bits of human voices are audible in the fray, and it occurs that this could be what it sounds like inside a womb. The rhythm marches on, and the submerged orchestra coagulates further, assembling a swirling purple storm that surrounds. Dark browns, blues and black become so dense that barely any light touches anything, eventually allowing for the droning monolithic sound to overtake everything.",

Whitman, 1892\n\n\n\nFor the next-to-last Static Pharming release of the year, RX23 exhibits a slow but steady descent into deeper waters. Opening with crackling texture from a waterlogged ship radio and the far off horn fanfare of a lost vessel's maiden voyage, \"Into Fog\" coalesces from vapors and humidity into a stately dub techno missive. This ship has traversed several strange seas throughout the year, and what you are hearing here is the sound of being unable to turn back. We're lost for good. All that remains is the vague hope that we will find someone or something familiar inside the fog. Light the lantern, turn down the sails and venture forth once again...",

Drawing itself in closely to your ears with big soft sails full of cool wind, Sift gradually reveals a waterlogged rhythm bobbing in and out and around the stereo field, marked occasionally by an echoing woodblock. A single note of extremely muddy bass crawls up to be felt, and the swelling chords of the sunken orchestra become more and more prominent. The whole vessel undulates for several minutes before fading away in a mistlike echo of its actual shape. \n\n\n\n\"We'll walk in ecstasy. Clear planet blue and green.\"\n\n-B. Fiftytwos, 1989",

A proof of concept that is able to stand on twenty-three other individual experiences. So you'll find that Static Pharming ends where it began - deep techno forms carved out of gaseous audio impressionistically, with the emphasis on lack of emphasis...a detailed meditation on the lack of detail. Hazy, out of focus and designed to induce altered states via repetition, low frequencies and swirling white noise. The Halifaxian vessel floats on, forward into the unknown.

      "about": "Verdant Acre is a massive new project by Coppice Halifax, conceived in Autumn 2011 with initial recording sessions commencing in November 2011. Heavily inspired by the deep ambient techno forests of GAS, the emotive washes of sadness in Yagya, the textural playgrounds of early Vladislav Delay and the brilliant detritus of The Caretaker, Verdant Acre spans a projected six or seven volumes of music, each to be released individually over the coming months. Recorded and assembled using only two drum machines, a mixer, FX devices and damaged orchestral vinyl, the music of Verdant Acre is wild, overgrown and unfamiliar, mirroring much of the dense swamp and marsh lands that Brian grew up exploring as a young man. The songs ooze green mutated growth, earthy darkness and muddy humid atmospheres, where recognizable melodies become tangled and dissonant like vines sprawling up an oak tree, and submerged womblike rhythms provide the only anchor in the abyss. Ideal listening for varying levels of consciousness.\n\n\n\nThis is volume one in the Verdant Acre series. Volume two will follow in March.",

      "about": "Now that the sixth of six volumes have been issued, and the long-running Verdant Acre series is over (or is it?), it only made sense to fashion a collector's box with which to contain the complete set. The Verdant Acre box set is a recycled cardboard box measuring 6x5x1 inches, bearing green text decals, hand numbering and six photographs of mutated Verdant landscapes. It contains all six volumes of the series, unabridged and repackaged in a new design that lends more cohesion with the box itself, making this assemblage both a nice looking item for your record shelf as well as a massive amount of essential Coppice Halifax listening. Totaling 37 tracks spread across seven discs, with a runtime of nearly eight hours, the Verdant Acre box set is packed to the brim with dense ambient techno from the humid heart of South Carolina.\n\n\n\nThe seventh disc, Verdant Versions, was created with the same concept as Basic Channel's BCD compilation disc in mind - one track selected from each of the six Acre volumes, and presented here in a more dancefloor-friendly iteration. The Versions tracks may bear recognizable resemblance to their originals, however listeners will note several differences...slower or faster tempos, EQ changes, re-mixed layers of sound and even additional bass and percussion elements have been recorded especially for these mutations. Verdant Versions provides yet one more step into the Acre, and accurately sums up many of the series' strongest moments.\n\n\n\nAs a consideration to the listeners who have already purchased volumes 1 through 6 separately, this box is being made available in two formats: filled with all 6 volumes, plus the Verdant Versions disc, or empty (the box and Verdant Versions only). Only the empty format features Verdant Versions on a black CD-R (like the previously released six volumes), while the filled box's contents have been pressed to standard CD-Rs, making the first editions that much more collectible.",

      "about": "A massive conceptual undertaking, Verdant Overgrowth is one of several planned epilogue works for the Verdant Acre six-volume series. After recording sessions for the VA series had finished, I returned to the source tapes and isolated every rhythm track from the original recordings, and adjusted the tempos to match up. Additionally, I isolated the musical elements of the tapes, themselves raw and mutated patches of decayed vinyl detritus and orchestral minor keys, and carefully combined elements from all six volumes to construct an aching eighty-minute ambient atmosphere**. Returning to the rhythm tracks, I assembled a seamless stereo mix containing every rhythm from every track in the six volumes, constantly fading in and out of one another and panning in a circular fashion that is both hypnotic and ever-evolving. Thus, Verdant Overgrowth is an appropriate title for a musical piece that at once sums up around seven hours of recordings and also stands alone as a deep psychedelic ambient techno landscape. \n\n\n\n**This atmosphere will be released in a beatless form at Wil Ru Recordings, bearing the title Verdant Dusk, in the near future.",

      "about": "The second of six volumes in the Verdant Acre series, and a successor to the previous volume in more ways than one. The dense, darkened forestry of the first hour seems to give way to an even deeper and more wildly overgrown part of the Acre. Triumphant horns made of dried leaves and rusted mechanical parts, now overtaken and reclaimed by nature, drone upward into a mute cloudy sky. Hundreds of years of debris uniformly coat the stereo field, each piece an echo of distant and long forgotten lifetimes. This second volume of Verdant Acre is so thick with aural dusts and detritus that it almost feels as if we are hearing the discarded shell of a time that has remained absolutely still for decades, bound by the shape of a world that has truly moved on, and filled with an epoch of longing and sadness. Limited edition of only 50 copies on black CD-Rs packaged in recycled cardstock sleeves with matte photo prints.",

      "about": "The fifth section of the Acre picks up exactly where we left off in Verdant Acre volume four. Dense layers of looped vinyl detritus climb like vines wrapping themselves around a static drum phrase. Clicks, crackles and fuzz fill in the empty holes of the rhythm and once more, the Acre is proving to us just how alive and wild it really is. A fog approaches, carrying the familiar drowned horns of the darker, murkier parts of the Acre. The sun is setting on us and it slowly occurs to us that we are completely lost in the forest...and yet, the black earthy rhythm plods forward into the steadily burnt up evening. Reverb trails coat all we see and hear (and feel) with the glossy dew that will no doubt be visible in the morning. We frantically locate a dry canopy that feels isolated and safe enough, and lay down our bedroll to get some sleep. As we drift off, stolen away by night's silent armies, we smell the soft and salty perfume of the sea, and somehow, we can hear the waves too. Perhaps tomorrow's expedition will reveal the blue horizon line we so long to see...",

      "about": "The fourth volume of the ever-expanding Verdant Acre series is perhaps the most accessible of the set thus far. Building atmospheres from a provenance of melodic and droning loops rather than composted chunks of earthy orchestra, and yielding a crop of six pieces that endlessly bounce and sway like treetops in a heavy wind. There's some cloud cover overhead, but it only takes a few steps forward and a couple deep inhaling breaths to realize the sun is creeping through and slowly brightening the entire landscape. What follows is slowly unveiled, like a massive translucent green curtain over your mind. Grandiose scenes of pastoral nostalgia and electronic summertime fantasies. The sunken orchestras beneath the forest floor have never been closer, their long detuned strings and cracked bows jutting up and out of the grass and mud like defiant threads of petrified wood, reaching for heaven in a long dying breath.",

      "about": "Verdant Acre's mass is equaled only by it's depth. Recorded throughout Autumn and Winter of 2011 and early Spring 2012, and released one volume per month over six months, with Verdant Versions and Verdant Overgrowth following as appendices. The music contained herein is the closest CH has probably ever come to creating music that is a realistic analog of nature - beauty and color buried beneath texture and noise, moments of blissful harmony that sink and waver beneath dissonant winds. The sound of time passing and seasons changing. At once, Verdant Acre is incredibly specific and totally universal.\n\n\n\nTaking (perhaps obvious) cues from influences like Wolfgang Voigt's GAS project, early Vladislav Delay, The Caretaker, Andrew Deutsch, Pole and Variant, this series continues to stand tall like the proverbial forest it is, even as the Halifaxian acres expand and run wild around it. This box set attempts to collect all six volumes, as well as Verdant Versions - a dancefloor-friendlier set of edits of one track from each of the six volumes - and Verdant Overgrowth, an 80-minute winding excursion of overlapping loops and rhythms blended together in a seamless pulse of hypnotic repetitions. This is the first time these eight volumes have been collected together in one place, and also the first time the Verdant Acre material has been on a physical format since going out of print sometime in 2013. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, two further box sets of Verdant tangents are being issued:  \n\n\n\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/verdant-compost\n\n\n\n  coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/verdant-night\n\n\n\n As well as the following ambient satellite piece: \n\n\n\ncoppicehalifax.bandcamp.com/album/verdant-dusk",

      "about": "Verdant Night is a (not entirely unexpected) beatless extension of the Verdant Acre series, created across several years of alchemical transmutation while the much more rhythmic Verdant Compost project ran parallel alongside its development. Verdant Night reduces each of the six volumes of Verdant Acre into a 60+ minute suite of texture, drones, humid atmospheres and sprawling generative sound. Built using only the original damaged vinyl sides which seeded the entire VA series, alongside an exhaustive studio rig of both analog and digital FX devices, reel to reel and cassette tapes and elaborate generational processing, in order to truly melt down the provenance of Verdant Acre and use it to germinate an entirely new overgrowth of dark green. \n\n\n\nEdited mixes of the six Verdant Night pieces are currently in progress in the White Pillar Workshop, which will complete the cyclical nature of the recordings by rejoining the ambient reductions with the original drum machines used, hopefully yielding a unique drone-techno reincarnation of this endless green sound. Additionally, the original ambient piece that inspired the creation of these six, Verdant Dusk, will appear as a \"satellite\" release to coincide with the Verdant series revival.",

      "about": "Almost seven years in gestation, Verdant Compost is finally ready to enter the public consciousness on Earth Day, 2017. A mammoth undertaking larger than any previous remix projects I've attempted before, Verdant Compost collects six discs of reconstituted Verdant Acre source sound, produced by a long and talented list of craftsmen from all over the world. \n\n\n\nThe first four discs are sequenced sets of mixes, and the final two are themselves full-length album affairs by Zwei Kreise and Orson Throb, respectively. From deep and dubbed out techno to thick, textured drones, and everywhere in between, Verdant Compost casts a wide range of colors, temperatures and atmospheres, all built using source recordings from the same damaged vinyl sides and drum machines I used to create the original six volumes of the Verdant Acre series. I owe a huge debt of gratitude to the many talented musicians who took part, in order of appearance:\n\n\n\nLamont Kohner (aka Electricwest / Eluder):  lamontkohner.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n Mind Over MIDI:  mindovermidi.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n The Green Kingdom (aka Dustcraft):  thegreenkingdom.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n Submersion:  audio.submersion.info\n\n\n\n Ourson (aka Plantre / Meadows & Labyrinths):  ourson.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n The Nautilus Project (aka Nemo):  thenautilusproject.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n Atheus:  atheus.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n Minute Of Arc (aka Arjen Schat / Ohrwert):  arjenschat.nl\n\n\n\n Giriu Dvasios (aka 101):  giriudvasios.bandcamp.com\n\n\n\n A.P.

      "about": "Further into the Acre we travel, with volume three of Verdant Acre arriving right on time in April. A vibrant Spring season filled with lapping streams, gentle sunshowers, the soft breath of green leaves and fields of blooming flowers. This third section of Verdant Acre is a stark contrast to the first two - where they were covered in moss, shade and black soils, this is a very warm and comfortable place, bright with yellow sunshine, inviting, fragrant. Sweeping chords of archaic wooden instruments bend down into the colorful tangles and shoot back up into the clouds. Percussions as simple as water burbling over rocks stir amongst the crackling-vinyl birdsong. Subtle threads of dissonance phase in and out of the pastoral harmonies, a reminder of the asymmetry and wild untamed overgrowths of nature undisturbed.",

Pink Acre is the first of two scheduled cassettes containing the most melodic and playful Coppice Halifax trax in years. Nestled in bedroom warmth and backyard field recordings, filled with echoing moments of adventuring with my daughter, Pink Acre bounds through green grass and crashes into honeysuckles, before curling up on a worn out sofa for a nap in a sunbeam. The music on this release and the Acre that will soon follow is for my daughter Penelope, to assist in her frequent jaunts of toybox carpet fantasies and her humming snoozes in the backseat of my car.

      "about": "Radians is an album by Coppice Halifax that has undergone many iterations and transformations since its original recording sessions were completed in 2011. Somewhat ironically, these transformed versions of Radians (Reflector on Entropy Records, Hallex and Red Sand at Contemporary Vision) have all been released before Radians itself - this was partially due to the nature of the project (differences in label release schedules, waiting on remixes to be completed, and so on) but in some way it has worked in the album's favor by way of referencing something that does not yet exist, creating a sort of mythology about it. \n\n\n\nMusically, Radians is four original pieces of organic Halifaxian techno, mutated and overgrown in the usual fashion. Meticulously decorated with textures, noises and all manner of analog depth, while still sporting vibrant rhythmic structures, dubby basslines, paint-spatter chords and tape-saturated drones, these four works fit well alongside other CH albums such as Narcotic Months and Dusk Versions. Complementing the originals are four remixes - presented in an inverted sequence so that the album unfolds itself in a reverse motion - by Ohrwert, Contemporary Vision, Emi Ono and a particularly deep rework of Melipal by Coppice Halifax. So the symmetry of Radians is complete, with a full eighty-minute album packed tightly onto a CD-R, and packaged minimally in a black cardboard jacket with stickers.",

      "about": "Drafted in Spring-Summer of 2012, as an ambient reduction of all six sides of the Verdant Acre vinyl source combined, and intended to be cast as a tonal backdrop for the shifting endless rhythms of Verdant Overgrowth. Initially kept isolated only for personal home listening, I was persuaded to release this by close friend/collaborator/confidante Eric Adrian Lee, as a part of an as-yet-unnamed catalog of minimalistic ambient music at his WR label in Portland. \n\n\n\nLike many things, and with many artists, time goes by, and after a couple years Verdant Dusk settled into a darkened corner of my studio's storage, along with untold hours of other unfinished or unreleased things. Only now, in 2017, with the recent crop of Verdant Acre reissues and expansions, will Verdant Dusk have its moment. \n\n\n\nMusically, Verdant Dusk applies a method of working and thinking that is not otherwise present on the Verdant Acre volumes, in that it exists solely in a mode of support, and was created without any notion of rhythm or even musicality. It is the sonic equivalent of a smear of purples and blues along a horizon line, as the clouds give way to a darker background, the color of nightfall. \n\n\n\nThis isolated notion of the Verdant Acre vinyl source being transmuted into fully beatless atmosphere was one I could not repress, after a few years of playing Verdant Dusk at night while I passed out reading, and so recording work resumed sometime in 2015 on a much larger effort. The fruits of those efforts became Verdant Night, issued concurrently with Verdant Dusk, as a sort of micro/macro-cosmic statement on the fluidity of time, and how meaningless time itself ultimately is outside of man-made systems. In nature, sounds exist in space. Time pulses out of focus. Night, unending.",

Recorded during the same time as the material for both Outward Residence and Parallel Harbors (at Other Heights, Belgium), but much softer and more catered to night time listening. Quiet, restrained rhythms bounce and sway in the background of a dark sonic ether, fogged by the repetitive layers of smoky chords and short melodic stabs punctuating the groove. Variations and refractions of delays twinkle and bubble like living sparks that decorate corners of the room too dark to see. Minimal notes of bass anchor the tracks with submarine propulsion, and sheets of translucent tape warmth and analog reverb are laid gently over the whole structure. This album is an exercise in finality, in closure. The end of another year, and the last appearance of the oft revisited track Dusk, with the minor exception of a remix album due out in 2012 at Other Heights, featuring Quantec, Grad_U, Ohrwert, Axs, Zzzzra and Textural Being.",

      "about": "When Coppice Halifax was first established as a peripheral project of Milieu in 2006, I never would've thought that the two different concepts would connect and overlap in the ways that they have since then. Albums like High Hawaiian Fog, Bedroom Carpet and now this one - they have all walked a very thin line between the CH sound and the Milieu sound. Milkwhite is in some ways a Halifaxian answer to a Milieu album like H Is For Hologram - all the same elements are present: classic drum machines, analog tape recording and an emphasis on a kind of \"pure\" bedroom electronic music. Where Hologram is more science-fiction, Milkwhite is fantasy, if that analogy makes any sense at all. I began work on this album years ago (sometime in 2010 I think) as nothing more than music for me to play at night while I passed out in bed reading a paperback. Hopefully, that aesthetic of intimate home-space music is still present in the final tracks (which themselves have been retooled and tightened up in spots, as reflected on the precursor release Sno Dreem). In short, Milkwhite is a playful set of feel-good bedroom braindance, sure to please appreciators of both the Milieu and Coppice Halifax varieties.",

      "about": "Coppice Halifax, originally a Milieu side-project, has now aged a decade. After a full year of painstaking selection, editing, sequencing and mastering, VAPORIZED FOREST INDEX is finally complete. A beginner's guide to the dense subtropical forests and the sprawling Atlantic seaside. Writing and assembling this collection has felt surreal and almost predetermined, as the track selection ended up numbering 33, while I am in my 33rd year. Three discs, as well - themselves grouped according to the general peaks and valleys of the Halifaxian oeuvre - spanning four hours of material from 2006 to 2016.\n\n\n\nThe first Cide, subtitled CARPET, contains fourteen tracks that orbit the earlier Coppice Halifax core of melodic techno. These are tracks inspired by Warp's Artificial Intelligence series, early Rephlex vinyl like Cylobian Sunset, Desktop Robotics and Wasted Sunday, as well as early RDJ like SAW 85-92 and Surfing On Sine Waves. These are the pieces that most easily blur the lines between Milieu and CH, and establish a provenance that spirals further outward into deeper and more textured acres. \n\n\n\nThe second Cide, subtitled CONTOUR, highlights the dub techno phase of CH, with tracks from the Analog Botany and Static Pharming series, Ocean Lion and Pawleys Island. This material is mostly inspired by Rod Modell's early Deepchord vinyl, labels like Chain Reaction, Mille Plateaux and early Kompakt, such as Dettinger or Jonas Bering. These pieces maintain a balance of techno rhythms and warm minimalistic basslines, anchored below layer upon layer of humid chords and restrained melodies - the sum of which often floats in a shallow pool of field recordings and tape hiss. \n\n\n\nThe third and final Cide, subtitled COMPOST, contains the summation of those years lost in the Halifaxian overgrowth. Heavily textured works filled with mammoth drones, orchestral tape loops, guitar feedback walls, modular synthesizer constructs and a truly Impressionistic presentation of ambient music, deep techno and bedroom experimentalism. These pieces have been inspired by GAS, Aleksi Perala's Colundi series, Ourson's Warming Plant album, Mika Vainio's Ø alias, early Vladislav Delay recordings and Steve Hitchell's sprawling Variant, Echospace and cv313 projects. \n\n\n\nAs a whole, these 33 tracks present a cohesive and guided trip through the Halifaxian ten year acre, while also hopefully providing a carefully considered tableaux of works for even the most ardent listener to appreciate. Where Milieu has always been a far more deliberate and composed project, Coppice Halifax eschews traditional forms of songwriting in favor of sonic mining and map making. Compost as composition, synthesis as song. \n\n\n\nFor most of these past ten years, I've not been the creator of these woods and oceans - only a cultivator of analog botany, riding a wave thick with seratonin and surrealism. I've never been a builder, but a draftsman, providing the means for possible realities to enter into existence. Like Michaelangelo digging out the statue from inside the stone, and Monet repainting the Rouen Cathedral dozens of times in different grades of sunlight, I have accepted that there are greater forms in the universe than those I can conjure on my own, and they are far richer things to excavate and frame with so many miles of rippling cassette tape. Shapes in the vapour, phosphenes in the darkness, vibrations and radio frequencies in dimly lit machines, nudged to and fro by a sleep-deprived hand.",

      "about": "White Pillar IV is the fourth of a multi-part series, intended to both document and transfigure the sonic ephemera from the White Pillar Workshop's surrounding area - a valley in southern Ohio, near such things as a USAF base, NASA and the Serpent Mound, the largest serpent effigy in the world, which dates back to 300 BCE. These locations and several others factor heavily into what populates the airwaves and frequency bands of many types, and the White Pillar series exists to isolate such bands and transmute them into something musically affecting. As such, it is fitting that this recording and those that follow it bear the namesake of the new studio, christening it publicly and properly, and looking ever forward to the future.\n\n\n\nThis fourth volume was recorded live using a 95% analog rig, including Korg Volca Beats/Bass/Keys, a Nintendo 3DS XL, a BBE Two Timer delay, a Nady MM14-FX delay mixer, the Alesis Quadraverb, a Pioneer spring reverb box and a Peavey FX2 mixing desk.",

      "about": "While looking through old hard drives and SD cards for a specific field recording, I stumbled upon three lost tracks from the very first White Pillar session, in November 2016. These three tracks were made right after the extended jam that became White Pillar 1, and feature the same gear configuration surfing across AM radio waves, zeroing in on interesting overtones and melodic transients. Vaguely remembered, and thought lost until now, they cohesively explore a liminal space between the White Pillar series and something more austere and experimental, such as Deep Earth. Huge sub bass collides with snappy percussive chunks, while fuzz-scrambled speech and pop music seeps through the radio bands like radiation. Surreal and unique techno for close listening as well as larger speaker systems.",

      "about": "White Pillar VII is the seventh of a multi-part series, intended to both document and transfigure the sonic ephemera from the White Pillar Workshop's surrounding area - a valley in southern Ohio, near such things as a USAF base, NASA and the Serpent Mound, the largest serpent effigy in the world, which dates back to 300 BCE. These locations and several others factor heavily into what populates the airwaves and frequency bands of many types, and the White Pillar series exists to isolate such bands and transmute them into something musically affecting. As such, it is fitting that this recording and those that follow it bear the namesake of the new studio, christening it publicly and properly, and looking ever forward to the future. \n\n\n\nThis seventh volume was recorded live using a 95% analog rig, including Korg MS-20 / Volca Beats / Volca Bass / Volca Keys / Yamaha QY-70 / Unisonic \"Chippendale\" 8-track receiver / Grass C-TCM / Moog ringmod / BBE Two Timer delay / Boss RV-3 / Alesis Quadraverb / Pioneer S202W springverb thru a Peavey FX2x24 board.",
