      "about": "This is a release for die-hards only. It’s the sound of Edward Ka-Spel lost in the Zone with synthesisers and effects units back in 1981, later developed a little ,but never heard by the wider World in it’s entirety until a few years ago. There have been snatches revealed, on “Kleine Krieg” in particular but the full-on Kosmisch Attack was perhaps considered too indulgent for public consumption during the previous 36 years.\n\nEven so, the session had a tantalising history. It was largely created in Conrad Schnitzler’s mighty music room in Berlin. EK stayed with him in 1981, ostensibly to make an interview for a fanzine (which sadly never appeared ), and the great pioneer kindly gave him shelter for almost a week.\n\nOne night Conrad had a dinner appointment and invited The Pink Dots' singer to “do whatever he wanted “ on the synths and echo chambers scattered around the magical space.\n\nIt was the equivalent of 15 Christmases arriving at once. He indulged himself and recorded the results for posterity. Bless you Conrad…we all miss you!\n\nNovember 15 2018…After several requests, the \"B\" side of the cassette edition was added to the original release. \"An Amsterdam Space Jam\" was created a little later in the 80s and is culled from several hours of improvisation on the Yamaha CS30 synthesiser which EK still owns and loves.\n\nAlas, the Cassette edition is long gone, and a very limited CD-R edition is in the works as this missive is being typed.",

      "about": "Maybe the best festivals are the small ones.\n\nCafe Oto in North East London can only hold 180 people but it was packed to the rafters for the Fourth Dimension Festival.Also on the bill was the truly legendary Alternative TV, Splintered and Steven Wilson's Bass Communion collaborating with Modelbau (Frans de Waard). The atmosphere was glorious, the music varied and always uplifting, and ultimately it was a Spring night not to be forgotten. Fellow Pink Dot Randall Frazier joined me on stage while Raymond Steeg was at the mixing desk. Thanks to Richo, who organised; Alena, who drove; Ruth, who filmed the event and Elisa, who helped. A small CDr edition of this album is planned in the near future.",

      "about": "\"Lyvv China Doll\" started life as an elaborate but very elusive cassette release from The Dots' TEKA label- it was half live material and half comprised of bits and pieces that needed a home.\n\nLater it became a cd for the Staalplaat label and the live side was dropped while more bits and pieces came into view.This remaster brings the two releases together.\n\nThe first live piece in the track listing is actually \"The Horn Section\" while a little later the first ever performance of \"So Gallantly Screaming.\" can be heard as a mere idea rather than a finished song. The year was 1985 and the venue was in the village of Delden in the far East of The Netherlands.\n\nNever heard of Delden? Guess what, they hadn't heard of us either (EK, Ignit, Ed van Kaye)..You could say the reaction was minimal when the screaming started; it even became mildly hostile when that horn section (actually miniature plastic saxophones from the gas station) were introduced. I'd like to think they still talk about it in Delden but they probably forgot decades ago.\n\nOther live tracks were from an especially heavy solo show in Vienna (1988) and Strasbourg (1986) where The Silverman and Stret Majest Alarme completed a particularly incendiary line-up.\n\nOther notable songs from Lyvv\" include \"Tower 8\" and \"When Old Gods Die\" (with Patrick Q.Paganini) which were the famous \"missing \" bonus songs from the original \"Chyekk China Doll\" cd. After this mysterious omission, the master tapes were delivered to a guy in Sweden for an intended 7\" release. Sadly tapes and guy disappeared. Thankfully EK had rough cassette copies in his drawer .\n\nFinally I must thank Hero Wouters for his amazing work on \"Dada\" and \"Beautiful Plastic\" (he wrote the music for the latter piece). Always a joy to work with Hero....Thanks too to Bianca Wouters for her voice ...This is the enhanced 2024 master. EK",

      "about": "It all began so informally. EK had fixed a few low key solo shows around Europe while old friend Nicoletta Stephanz just happened to be on the same continent and had brought her theramin and box of delights with her. \n\nA collaboration seemed like a first class idea although rehearsals were out of the question.\n\nNicoletta's presence added that extra element of chance - but hell, what a glorious element.\n\nAt one point it seemed like she was playing the air itself with a magic wand. EK and Silverman just stared …open-mouthed…Marvellous! Then there was her voice part …..a massive choir of her voice through a myriad of effects. Swathes of improvisation occurred. \n\nIn fact the concert represented here (at Stuttgart) for this cdr release was one of the first…..this trio went on to tour the US finishing with a bizarre climax in Seattle where the whole audience joined in with the band in a song about a happy doughnut.\n\nThere were other faces onstage too during the U.S leg of the tour in 2003 .Ninah Pixie played a circuit bent flower with the trio in San Francisco while EK's all-time hero Daevid Allen joined the band for the encore section of the same show.\n\nTruly unlikely events and also unforgettable…\n\nA big thank you to Nicoletta , Lisa and Ray.",

      "about": "‘Caste o’ Graye Skreeens’ was the first album in a trilogy loosely alluding to seafaring adventures.\n\nAs a child I was a little obsessed by the legend of “The Flying Dutchman” and it was definitely \n\nat the back of my mind as this album from the the start of the millennium was painstakingly constructed.\n\nThe main piece ‘Our Captain’s Eyes’ pays tribute to Procol Harum’s ‘A Salty Dog’ , a song that resonated deeply \n\nwhen I was young and makes me cry to this day.\n\nSadly “Caste” was seemingly doomed from the beginning. Perhaps the 53 minutes duration of the piece frightened people off\n\nbut it was also one of the last releases by World Serpent before the company folded. Consequently it probably never reached \n\na single shop.\n\nNevertheless a couple of boxes of the original cd are in stock at Chez Dots.\n\nThe 2023 remaster splits “Our Captain’s Eyes” into five parts asI have to concede that my original concept was perhaps too \n\nextreme. The beautiful cover is an original painting by Monadiki.",
