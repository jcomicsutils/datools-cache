It was a \"drone-like\" sound of a few minutes, Despite the difficult nature of the assignment, Massimo loved the very static and cryptic structure of the original. So, starting from this basic recording (without using additional sounds) he developed a 45 minutes long suite: it was like using a magic audio lens which revealed a myriad of hidden details in a microscopic world. The original Astro sound can still be heard at the beginning and at the end of the suite\". \n\n\n\nThe reissue comes in a cardboard case with silver-embossed printing and doesn't include the screensaver, wallpaper and extra Astro file from the original release.",
