      "about": "[Acid Mothers Temple & Space Paranoid]\n\nAn Acid Mothers Temple unit formed in 2013 at the request of our Spanish booking agent, who wanted to see Acid Mothers Temple playing Black Sabbath. A new unit was duly formed and toured the Iberian peninsula. \n\nOriginally the group's existence was to be limited to this one tour, however we realised that both AMT＆The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. and AMT＆The Cosmic Inferno had long moved beyond their original psychedelic heavy rock roots to play a wide range of music. So we decided to keep Acid Mothers Temple & Space Paranoid as a permanent unit that would focus just on spacey heavy rock. \n\nWe were determined to draw a line between us and the many doom metal and black metal bands who have also been inspired by Black Sabbath. So, placing Sabbath back into the early seventies context of their birth, we have defined them as a British blues rock band. To this template we have added sixties psychedelic elements, as well as an improvisational approach (something that Sabbath virtually never do live), and we have attempted to reconstruct their songs in heavier and spacier way. The group will not limit itself to Black Sabbath covers, but will consider to explore the possibilities of ever spacier, ever heavier blues rock.\n\n\n\nThis is the only one studio album of Acid Mothers Temple & Space Paranoid. The group broke up in 2017.\n\nThe original LP was released by Safety Meeting Records, and the CD was released by Chaotic Noise Recordings in 2013.\n\nThis digital album was remastered for Bandcamp by Kawabata Makoto.",

Also the present drummer Satoshima Nani’s first year.\n\nThis is rare that the band played new song “Benzaiten” from the new album, that’s why the band has never played this song after Tsuyama left from the band. In middle of the set, Nani broke his bass drum head completely, so he moved floor tom as bass drum in the end of the set.\n\nThis digital live album was released only for Bandcamp.",

The group played only 2 song for 55 min., “Pink Lady Lemonade” and “Cometary Orbital Drive” both songs are led by minimal guitar riffs, rhythm section (Satoshima Nani on drums and Sawano Shozo on bass) developed songs. They played like “minimal trance set”.\n\nThis digital live album was released for only Bandcamp.",

      "about": "This original cassette tape \"Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. 1\"was released for Mainliner US tour in Feb.1997.\n\nAnd reissued on dbl LP by Synesthetic Recordings in Nov. 2007 as \"The Early Acid Mothers Temple Recordings 1995 - 1997\", then as a dbl CD by OHM Records/Synesthetic Recordings in Jun. 2016. \n\nThis is the pre-1st album, some tracks are early version.\n\n\n\n[ liner notes from reissue by Synesthetic Recordings]\n\n\n\nIn 1995 the quartet of Kawabata Makoto (Musica Transonic, Mainliner, Toho Sara), Koizumi Hajime (ex. Mainliner, ex. Seventh Seal), Suhara Keizo (Arijigoku, Rashinban), and Cotton Casino (Mady Gula Blue Heaven) formed a new group and started to record their improvised jam sessions. The group did not yet have a name at this point in their existence. A group of social dropouts of every description - musicians, dancers, artists, farmers, channellers, ex-yakuza, mermaid researchers and professional vagrants - known as the Acid Mothers Temple Soul Collective, had already begun to coalesce around Kawabata.\n\n\n\nSeveral years earlier Kawabata had spent some time in a beatnik commune in Nagano, but he soon left, having become repulsed by their exclusionary left-wing ideology and hypocritical ecological activities. In response he had founded his own commune, one without any political ideology or ethics save that of non-interference in each other's lives. The mission of this \"hometown of souls\" would be to open its doors to anyone who was still searching for something in life.\n\n\n\nAround the same time Kawabata had become involved in the Tokyo underground scene through his role as guitarist with Musica Transonic. Determined to do something to introduce the world to the other members of the Acid Mothers Temple Soul Collective, he decided to invite them to join his as yet untitled new improvising jam band. His old friend Higashi Hiroshi and many other members of the collective started to participate in the group's recording sessions. This would be the beginning of Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. (AMT).\n\n\n\nIn 1996 a limited edition cassette entitled Acid Mother's Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. (note that the band's name was spelled with an apostrophe in the beginning) was sold at an event that Kawabata played at. This was the first release to bear the AMT name, and it included recordings by the original quartet, an early take of \"Speed Guru\", and other recordings dating from 1995 and early 1996.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, Kawabata joined Mainliner on their US and European tour. He took with him two limited edition cassettes entitled Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. 1 and Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. 2, which were sold at gigs on the tour. They consisted of recordings from 1995 to 1997, including tracks by the original quartet with added overdubs and newly recorded tracks. After the tour ended, Kawabata went back to work on these pieces, mixing and adding new overdubs. These would eventually become the recordings that were released by PSF as the band's eponymous first album (PSFD-93), so the original cassettes may be considered as \"demo\" versions of that record.\n\n\n\nWhile these early recordings were released under the AMT name, they were in fact closer in concept to Kawabata's solo albums. Recordings of improvised jams were manipulated using musique concrete methodology and remade into Kawabata's personal image of psychedelic music. There was no intention for the group to play live, and in fact there were no gigs in the first few years. But when the first PSF album was released, Kawabata decided to tour overseas for the first time in June 1998. Soon afterwards Tsuyama Atsushi joined the group, and began to cement its identity as a live band. The process of transformation from a Kawabata solo project into a group was one that began around this time and still continues today.",

      "about": "This original cassette tape \"Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. 2\"was released for Mainliner US tour in Feb.1997.\n\nAnd reissued on dbl LP by Synesthetic Recordings in Nov. 2007 as \"The Early Acid Mothers Temple Recordings 1995 - 1997\", then as a dbl CD by OHM Records/Synesthetic Recordings in Jun. 2016. \n\nThis is the pre-1st album, some tracks are early version.\n\n\n\n[ liner notes from reissue by Synesthetic Recordings]\n\n\n\nIn 1995 the quartet of Kawabata Makoto (Musica Transonic, Mainliner, Toho Sara), Koizumi Hajime (ex. Mainliner, ex. Seventh Seal), Suhara Keizo (Arijigoku, Rashinban), and Cotton Casino (Mady Gula Blue Heaven) formed a new group and started to record their improvised jam sessions. The group did not yet have a name at this point in their existence. A group of social dropouts of every description - musicians, dancers, artists, farmers, channellers, ex-yakuza, mermaid researchers and professional vagrants - known as the Acid Mothers Temple Soul Collective, had already begun to coalesce around Kawabata.\n\n\n\nSeveral years earlier Kawabata had spent some time in a beatnik commune in Nagano, but he soon left, having become repulsed by their exclusionary left-wing ideology and hypocritical ecological activities. In response he had founded his own commune, one without any political ideology or ethics save that of non-interference in each other's lives. The mission of this \"hometown of souls\" would be to open its doors to anyone who was still searching for something in life.\n\n\n\nAround the same time Kawabata had become involved in the Tokyo underground scene through his role as guitarist with Musica Transonic. Determined to do something to introduce the world to the other members of the Acid Mothers Temple Soul Collective, he decided to invite them to join his as yet untitled new improvising jam band. His old friend Higashi Hiroshi and many other members of the collective started to participate in the group's recording sessions. This would be the beginning of Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. (AMT).\n\n\n\nIn 1996 a limited edition cassette entitled Acid Mother's Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. (note that the band's name was spelled with an apostrophe in the beginning) was sold at an event that Kawabata played at. This was the first release to bear the AMT name, and it included recordings by the original quartet, an early take of \"Speed Guru\", and other recordings dating from 1995 and early 1996.\n\n\n\nIn 1997, Kawabata joined Mainliner on their US and European tour. He took with him two limited edition cassettes entitled Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. 1 and Acid Mothers Temple & The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. 2, which were sold at gigs on the tour. They consisted of recordings from 1995 to 1997, including tracks by the original quartet with added overdubs and newly recorded tracks. After the tour ended, Kawabata went back to work on these pieces, mixing and adding new overdubs. These would eventually become the recordings that were released by PSF as the band's eponymous first album (PSFD-93), so the original cassettes may be considered as \"demo\" versions of that record.\n\n\n\nWhile these early recordings were released under the AMT name, they were in fact closer in concept to Kawabata's solo albums. Recordings of improvised jams were manipulated using musique concrete methodology and remade into Kawabata's personal image of psychedelic music. There was no intention for the group to play live, and in fact there were no gigs in the first few years. But when the first PSF album was released, Kawabata decided to tour overseas for the first time in June 1998. Soon afterwards Tsuyama Atsushi joined the group, and began to cement its identity as a live band. The process of transformation from a Kawabata solo project into a group was one that began around this time and still continues today.",
