And with that, we felt sober enough to declare that we had scratched the itch, made a few pyres for a vinegar-bake, and let the loops do their kidding.",

Nevertheless, a dumping sensory flick came over us, and delve we did, into the deepest oracles and skipping limbos, atop lowest bar settings, sputtery nonchalance, that gibbering man that tends to make a cameo on our records, and of course, plenty of triangle vs circle accommodations and spats. And so, err we go, sidelong and with wending entropy, a feasting lesson in wrist hurtings, busted floorboards, the tiny Sony recorder doing its darnedest, and chug, we tell you, lots of chug, all in all leading to this terse pileup, winking in morse code the word bubo, tongues lashing with hi's, over and over again, and one day across the ocean, wherever that may be.",

      "about": "PH dropped us a friendly message several months ago about tying a few sounds together and spreading them out over a fallow field. And so, we did just that, letting the soothing scrounges commingle with the oddball additives and late night pollinators, many of whom would flutter in through the gloaming winter-glazed windows, doing their mothy twitches by sending germs and wheezes every which-way, ultimately adding a grin of stability to an otherwise empty lot in the back forty. Now that's what we call a garden! \n\n\n\nThe jury is out on the entire process, as we allowed this collaboration to slow cook, occasionally fester, and often become something of a game of frisbee, lobbing tracks to and fro across the ocean. Countless sound sources were tossed into the seed packet, thereafter channeled, slapped onto cassette, and regurgitated back into digitized crumbles. \n\n\n\nRecorded October 2o22 through February 2o23 via the Chapman studios in the U.K., and here parts 'murka, Maine & California.",

      "about": "Clatters in the chaparral led to us wandering in concentric circles, wondering what the hairy poodle that sound was. An atmospheric river hung low that winter, compelling us to record the squishes and squeaks in manners that were efficacious, tidy, and hopefully dry. The results spanned late into evening forums; marrying no-erasehead tape decks and wee digital recorders with a myriad of low brow toys, jewels, trombones, vocalisms, loops, and electro-doot, all transmogrified via a very, very small piezo transducer. The resulting jumble nearly threw us into stupefaction, and so we compacted the renegades by bundling 'em all into bite-sized collages, to which we present here: adventures with a tiny contact microphone.",

Long windedness truncated, this here manner of strep coughed a mild medley of critter dishes featured in recent years from our SoundCloud account; to which the intrepid of ye can wander thereabouts for free downloads of this stuff, too, wink wink. Nevertheless, it's an alright fathom, we suppose. Heavy muscle breath, clinking sidewalk finds, tape machinations, dumb voicing, hissy noises, award winning misspelling, and deliberate drives into nowherescapes. We can't really tell tales about equipment styles or that sort of steamy smelling consumption bias as these tracks more or less sound the same to us - but in a meaningful way, where automaton chins can yawn and self stroke, murmuring affirmation diets about memetic hampers and choke out preambles like, to heck in a hand basket about all this needless evolving, we gut this.

What started as a Sunday afternoon studio cleaning session digressed into a multi-cassette player scramble and plopping 'em into a randomly downloaded off the web streaming / podcasting app. The app itself produces a significant time-lag (comparing the live board with the transmitted sound); this enabled us to mix in and modulate off-the-internet signal feeds, resulting in a delightfully staggered wart-filled fuzz in amongst all the found tape splatter and junk sounds. This recording is a no-edit dealie, barnacles and all. Enjoy!!",

Or maybe it's all just fine, fine fine fine, like being neighbors with other disassociated states. Clearly the methodology has gone (or still goes?) for broke, oft resorting to, yeah well, mumbling spiels about character-building contests, adopting & electrifying inanimate objects as pets, and thereafter, possible intervention from the authorities when caught sneaking toilet seats into national parks for tourist winks and pratfalls. \n\n\n\nWell, anyway. Cheerful transgressions aside, Fleecing Thesis contains a cumulative roll of said-inanimate objects (adopted or not) dating from surly ancient 2o16, through the muckling prepandemic habits of stealing hotel bibles, to the everlasting huzz & blurts from 2o22.",

While this did in fact happen, for whatever reason it got shelved and went into hibernation - until now. A recent re-listening found this secret gem to be actually repeatable, maybe even kinda fun, and certainly capable of hitting well beyond the zones of our comfortable dump truck of thrifted parts & gadgetry. Featured herein? Voiceovers and voice stuff, loops and bloops, singalongs, multiple visitations from a beastly prepared guitar, reverse-glue records, and questionable sound sources merging digital phenomena with analog weirdo-person-in-a-room-yelling at trashcans.",

We recall the tactic: trundle off to visit the Scottish branch of our international cult, make a pile of recordings using a handy dandy Aiwa cassette recorder featuring the retractable mic, remix the sounds a couple months later on the pink boombox at BBF in Harpsie, Maine; then, finally, dash it off into the mail, maybe circa 1997 or so? and wait a few decades for it to re-emerge from the lichen curds of memetic cardboard & bubblewrap, liberated from its proverbial broom closet suite in Brighton, UK.\n\n\n\nThis purpling welt of a salvo was intercepted by our pal, Dylan Nyoukis, of Decaer Pinga & Chocolate Monk infamy. Mr Nyoukis not only stars as a darling co-collaborator in this brillo, we raise our stout coffee mugs to celebrate and acknowledge his generosity in digitizing a humble multi-mile cassette into a format that all of us can swoon to.",

      "about": "Digging deep into the belly of the hiss, a few period-parched incantations arose. We'd long forgotten this one, but to our mind, now rejoice in polishing it off from the atrophied collection of other half-wits we'd damned ourselves into doing. In brief, Record the Smudge, a line borrowed at the time from our dear pal, Micha, follows the rather arcane narrative of the fish-eyed one, whereupon he took it upon himself to recant many a weirdness by adopting the yes, guitar, as a formidable object lesson. It was a transitional era, perhaps, back when one could actually do that sort of thing: detune the esophageal croaks by virtue of tabac, groan or grow the hell out of other binding furtive whiffs, and delight, as a deserter, in the scrambled legs of minimally amalgamating clutter such as folding chairs, tape recorders, trash cans, and singing... boy, talk about croons! At any rate, the album speaks for itself as a tangled tome; part home-brew cassette journal, part jangly cringe-salmon saccharine, and a penultimate fave oracle, or if not, a perennial candidate for head-scratching posts sold to select mudskippers, mossbacks, and folks who study the circle/triangle fossil named Huso.",
      "credits": "released December 31, 2009\n            \n            This album came out somewhere between 2009 and 2010. While it was recorded at the BBF in Harpsie, Maine, it drew upon a bunch of seemingly unrelated activities at the time: noise tours with PCRV, making art installations for our friend Micha Barthel, and an art residency that had a lasting impact on us, CESTA, in Tabor, Czech Republic. How all of these components ended up being channeled into acoustic guitar songs and scrapes still eludes us to this day.",

      "about": "A rescue release, of sorts. No clue as to how this got out there, sat around for several decades, only by chance to find itself back in our mitts. Mysteries aside, what this recording represents is a sturgeony foray into FM broadcasting. From 1997 to 2004, we engineered a late night radio show called,\"A Butte for Huso\", which aired every other Monday night on WMPG (located at the campus of the University of Southern Maine). This particular episode is a mixture, probably mastered at the radio station's production studio onto cassette or DAT, featuring highlights from shows number 54 through 57. Each show was experimental: usually consisting of live multichannel & multiple sources playing back simultaneous blends of live room mics, found sounds, thrift store finds, \"anti journal tapes\", impromptu performances, and reprocessing methods - 6 foot reel to reel tape loops, contact mic'd turntables, prepared records, live phone-ins, delay pedals, our trusty Tascam four track - one gets the idea.",
      "credits": "released April 30, 1999\n            \n            This recording consists of live radio sessions with Gaylord Pasternak, Sickness, and Johnny Headset; with additional contributions from Adinah Barnett, Mute Ant Sounds, and the Dismembraned Kazoo Orchestra. Crank added & mixed all the other stuff. The original recording was (apparently?) released on cassette by Extraction Records in April 1999. We graciously thank Henry Mallard for unearthing this and sending it our way.",

Beyond nothing in particular other than an ode to living in a barn, snugged away deep amongst a wooly coastal New England town one would rather not visit too frequently, a further kestrel lurk could peel the ire to reveal a tweedy dumblesome collage of four track hollering and attic-inspired mumblings. In modern lexicon, 'Nial is also an acoustic guitary thwapping gesticulation, a perturbationalized tubing subsectional booger-flick in the eye of inadequate ph balance, pine cone rubbings, and early 40 something frottage. It's CS at his worst, and by the cassette's conclusion, we're no less leery for the lair.\n\n\n\n- Max Sanderson, Professor Emeritus, South Harpswell Institute of Technology",
