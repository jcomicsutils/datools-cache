      "about": "Three Short Prayers to Saint Expedite\n\n\n\nMay the intercession of the glorious Martyr, St. Expedite, recommend us, O my God, to Thy goodness, in order that his protection may obtain for us what our own merits are powerless to do.\n\n\n\nAmen\n\n\n\nWe supplicate Thee Lord, to inspire, by Thy grace all our thoughts and actions. That thou being their principle, we may by the intercession of St. Expedite, be conducted with courage, fidelity and promptitude, at the time proper and favorable, and come to a good and happy end. Through our Lord, Jesus Christ.\n\n\n\nAmen\n\n\n\nSt. Expedite honored by the gratitude of those who have invoked thee at the last hour and for pressing cases. We pray thee to obtain from the all-powerful goodness of God, by the intercession of Mary Immaculate, today, or such a day the grace we solicit with all submission to the Divine Will.\n\n\n\nAmen",

We can not help thinking, on this day,\n\nthat no one of us lacks a model to follow in one of you.\n\nWe look around us at the familiar persons and things\n\nand activities that fill our every day lives,\n\nand we find that they are little different from the persons,\n\nthings, and activities that filled your lives.\n\nWe have the same human nature,\n\nwounded by the sin of Adam and Eve,\n\nbut strengthened marvelously by grace,\n\nand fed and sanctified by the sacraments and prayer.\n\nWe have exactly the same sacraments that you had,\n\nwe have the same Christ,\n\nthe same Blessed Mother,\n\nthe same trials,\n\nsickness, pain, temptation,\n\nthe same joys, pleasures,\n\nand happiness that crowded your lives.\n\nThen it must be true that,\n\nwith the same means,\n\nwe should be able to work out our lives\n\nin the same holiness and sanctity as yours, dear saints.\n\nHelp us to do this.\n\nHelp us to see the opportunities for holiness\n\nthat fill our everyday lives.\n\nObtain for us, by your prayers,\n\nthe deep understanding and appreciation\n\nof spiritual things that were yours.\n\nHelp us to see, too,\n\nin the beauty of the world in which we live,\n\nsome slight mirroring of the eternal beauty\n\nwhich you now see,\n\nas you gaze on God.\n\nBut let us not be deceived into thinking that this earthly beauty,\n\nthis worldly pleasure,\n\nis an end in itself.\n\nLet us use it wisely and moderately,\n\nour hearts always yearning to come at last\n\nto the final beauty and joy,\n\nthe possession of God Himself,\n\nwith you, in heaven.\n\n\n\nAmen.",

      "about": "अधिकांश वयस्कों को कुछ परेशानी होती है क्योंकि वे चिंतित या घबराहट महसूस करते हैं, लेकिन कुछ के लिए यह एक पैटर्न है जो नियमित आधार पर नींद में हस्तक्षेप करता है। चिंता के लक्षण जो अनिद्रा का कारण बन सकते हैं उनमें शामिल हैं:\n\n\n\n तनाव\n\n पिछले घटनाओं के बारे में विचारों में पकड़ा जा रहा है\n\n भविष्य की घटनाओं के बारे में अत्यधिक चिंताजनक\n\n जिम्मेदारियों से अभिभूत महसूस करना\n\n पुनर्जीवित या अतिरंजित होने की सामान्य भावना\n\n\n\nयह देखना मुश्किल नहीं है कि सामान्य चिंता के इन लक्षणों को क्यों सोना मुश्किल हो सकता है। चिंता को अनिश्चित अनिद्रा (नींद में परेशानी), या रखरखाव अनिद्रा (रात के दौरान जागना और सोने में वापस आने में सक्षम नहीं) से जुड़ा हो सकता है। किसी भी मामले में, रात की शांत और निष्क्रियता अक्सर तनावपूर्ण विचारों या यहां तक ​​कि उन भयों को भी लाती है जो एक व्यक्ति को जागते रहते हैं।\n\n\n\nजब यह कई रातों (या कई महीनों) के लिए होता है, तो आपको सोने की संभावना पर चिंता, भय या आतंक महसूस करना शुरू हो सकता है। इस प्रकार चिंता और अनिद्रा एक दूसरे को खिला सकती है और एक चक्र बन जाती है जिसे उपचार के माध्यम से बाधित किया जाना चाहिए। संज्ञानात्मक और दिमाग-शरीर तकनीकें हैं जो चिंता से पीड़ित लोगों की नींद में मदद करती हैं, और समग्र स्वस्थ नींद प्रथाएं जो चिंता और अनिद्रा के साथ कई लोगों के लिए नींद में सुधार कर सकती हैं।",

      "about": "Edited Transcript of Videotape - October 5, 1996:\n\n\n\nThis is a very exciting time for us. Who is us? I'm \"Do\" (pronounced \"Doe\") for starters, and I have in front of me a number of students, or my classroom, or in old language of a couple of thousand years ago, my disciples - those who are trying to prepare themselves for entry into the Evolutionary Level Above Human, synonymous with the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven. We're going to talk to you about the most urgent thing that is on our mind, and what we suspect is the most urgent thing on the minds of those who will connect with us.\n\n\n\nWe'll title this tape, \"Planet Earth About to be Recycled - Your Only Chance to Evacuate is to Leave With Us.\" Planet Earth about to be recycled - Your only chance to survive or evacuate is to leave with us. Now, that's a pretty drastic statement - pretty bold - in terms of religion, in terms of anybody's intelligent thinking. To most people who would consider themselves intelligent beings, they'd say, \"Well, that's absurd. What's all this doomsday stuff? What's all this prophetic, apocalyptic talk?\" You know, intelligent human beings should realize that all things have their own cycle. They have their season. They have their beginning, they have their end. We're not saying that planet Earth is coming to an end. We're saying that planet Earth is about to be refurbished, spaded under, and have another chance to serve as a garden for a future human civilization.\n\n\n\nNow, the reason this is such an interesting time is not only because we're on the threshold of the end of this civilization (because it's about to be recycled), but because of where that finds us, and where that finds you - where that finds those who would judge us - how we would speak of them, and how they would speak of us. Now, you might say, \"You keep saying `us'? Who do you think you are?\" Well, I, in all honesty, to address that must first acknowledge who my Father is. My Father is not a human father. My Father is a member of the Evolutionary Level Above Human - the Kingdom of God - the Kingdom of Heaven. My Father - long before this civilization began - gave me birth into that Kingdom Level Above Human, that Kingdom of Heaven, that Kingdom of God.\n\n\n\nNow, you can say, \"I can't believe that!\" Well, it's up to you whether you believe that or not. That's not important to me, even though I wish that you could believe it for your sake. For those who do believe it stand a possibility of having a future beyond this recycling time. Now, you say, \"According to religious literature, I thought there was someone else who was going to come and be our \"Savior\" here at these last days - that that was going to be Christ's return?\" Well, the name \"Christ\" or the name \"Jesus\" might be a little confusing. Because the name \"Jesus,\" of course, was merely the name given to the body that that mind (that was indeed from the Kingdom of Heaven) incarnated into. That mind was here 2000 years ago, and that mind came for the express purpose of teaching humans how they could be \"saved\"- how they would not be plowed under at the End of the Age. Well, we're now at the End of the Age. So that mind that was in Jesus - What? That mind, that spirit, that soul is me, and in this body called \"Do\" that you're looking at? You'll have to decide that for yourself. I must admit that I am here again. That I'm here saying exactly the same thing that I said then, trying to say it in today's language, trying to hope that, for your sakes, you can see what we have to offer you. For the Next Level, through my Father and through me, is offering you LIFE for the first time - and we're not talking about human life.\n\n\n\nNow, the planet is about to be recycled, and we say we see the planet as a steppingstone - planet Earth as a steppingstone. Just as with a civilization, that civilization can evolve upwards - each segment within that civilization has the option to become more civilized, less barbaric. It would be better for them if they took more civilized options. Not that they necessarily do. Sometimes they seem to appear to be more civilized when, in fact, they have become more barbaric, more quick to condemn the rest of the world, more quick to kill the rest of the world that does not think as they think.\n\n\n\nWell, I know what I said a few moments ago. I said that I am the return of the Son of my Father. I'll tell you something that's even more remarkable: my Father came with me this time. He came in the early `70's, took on a human form - an adult female human form. He helped me \"get into\" an adult human form, in the early `70's. And we together helped those who came with us (our students, who were also here 2000 years ago as disciples) get in the bodies that they are presently wearing - so that they could rid themselves of human behavior, human activity, human thinking - so that they could be ready at this time to move into the Kingdom of Heaven or the Evolutionary Level Above Human.\n\n\n\nThese that are sitting before me have been students of Ti and Do - Ti, my Father - and they are still students of Ti and Do, even though Ti returned to the Heavens in 1985. Ti is my Heavenly Father and is the One who gave me birth into that Kingdom before this civilization began. Now, I'm not here to sell you on that, or who I am or who these are. I'm here to offer you, as these are, an opportunity to know the Truth, so that if you can connect with it, at any level, then you might survive the re-spading or the recycling that is about to occur.\n\n\n\nWe made a tape just shortly ago, and in that tape we said that there are three types of individuals who will survive the recycling. One type is those individuals who have overcome their humanness enough that when the End of this Age is complete, when the war is over (the spading complete, there is nothing left here except for recycling), when the end of that occurs, that first type will have reached a condition of having overcome human behavior, human thinking, human desires - desiring only to be in the Kingdom of Heaven, in the Evolutionary Level Above Human, being of service in that Kingdom. When they have done that overcoming to that degree, at that point they are a match for a physical body belonging to that Kingdom.\n\n\n\nHumans think that this is a flesh body world, and it is. But, more importantly, it is a human flesh body world. The Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Evolutionary Level Above Human also has bodies. I wouldn't say flesh bodies because they have different characteristics. But it is a physical body, a biological body, and in a sense, it is equivalent to a human body for that next Evolutionary Level. It doesn't need the kind of fuel that humans need, for it's not a mammalian body. It doesn't reproduce. It's not male nor female. It probably would look like what you might consider a very attractive \"extraterrestrial.\" Most of the illustrations of extraterrestrials these days have been grotesque - looked like giant insects, or slimy reptilians, or have eyes so big that you could fall into them. An extraterrestrial that we would consider a genuine extraterrestrial is not a \"fallen angel,\" is not a \"space alien.\"\n\n\n\nWe see fallen angels and space aliens as synonymous - fallen angels and space aliens are synonymous. And the Next Level - the only real extraterrestrials - have a body similar to the human body. The human body was made from the same basic design, the same general form, except the human body is more animal than that Next Level form. The human body has hair, needs teeth, has physical characteristics that are appropriate to this environment. When you go into an environment that does not require eating things that you have to pull off the bone, or crack the shells off the nut, then certainly teeth are not needed. A Next Level body in a non-earthly environment also needs no hair. That Next Level body is a creature that looks very attractive, has two eyes, some remnant of a nose, some remnant of ears - what you would call remnants - even though they function very well as nose, as ears. They have a voice box, but don't really need to use it, for they can communicate by thought - communicate with their minds. And that's an extraterrestrial - that is the \"body\" belonging to a member of the Evolutionary Level Above Human, the Kingdom of Heaven, the Kingdom of God. It's true, they could seem unattractive to you if you're really \"into\" human flesh bodies and see them as beautiful.\n\n\n\nYou know, there are sayings that there is seed of flesh, or there are things that are born of flesh, and there are things that are born of spirit. Also, born of water is synonymous with being born of flesh. If people really understood the more accurate of the religious literature, and could read it as it was intended to be read, they would know it clarifies that seed of flesh (human) was and is, literally, seed of the negative, the opposition, the space aliens, the fallen angels. Therefore, to the Next Level, human flesh has become a product of the lower forces, and is of the kingdom level beneath the Kingdom of God - that kingdom level that rightfully should be only a steppingstone leading to the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n\n\nNow, this understanding isn't meant to put you down or to say that an individual is necessarily \"evil\" just because they're wearing a human vehicle. I'm wearing a human vehicle, because I have to wear one for this task. I don't like it. It doesn't match me. And those who sit in front of me don't like their human vehicles that they have to wear for this task. But they have to wear them, because the task of overcoming the human kingdom requires that they overcome human flesh - the genetic vibrations, the lust of the flesh, the desire to reproduce, the desire to cling to offspring, or spouse, or parents, or house, or money, or fame, or job, or, or - that could go on and on - overcoming the human flesh and its desires - even its religious desires. There is not a religion on the face of the globe that is of God, as it is today. All of those ideologies that are called religions use corrupted records and corrupted interpretations of man's relationship with someone from the Kingdom of God, the Evolutionary Level Above Human.\n\n\n\nIn other words, it's like the religious literature (the Bible, the Torah, the Koran, etc.) are written as time manuals. So that ancient religious literature, with its laws and rules, was appropriate to the time that it was written in and to that phase of civilization. Less ancient literature, with its laws, was appropriate to its own particular age. What did the \"Lord\" God - the one who was here long before the Messiah came - say to His people? Through His prophets, He said, `I will send a Savior, a Messiah to help you get out of the human kingdom,' knowing that some humans should certainly reach a condition where they would be ready to move up into His Kingdom by that period in time when His Representative - the Messiah - would be sent. When the One He sent came as the \"Messiah,\" truly some in the civilization at that time were prepared for the information - the steps, the requirements - that that Messiah had to offer to those who would seek His Father's Kingdom.\n\n\n\nWell, that Savior came, that Messiah came. And after a brief teaching period with those He picked - those who were His disciples/students - He said, `I will come again.' And His Father sent Him again. And for me to say that I was and am He, is to most, utter blasphemy. In other words, what I say to you now is a direct, present, current transmission - information from the Kingdom Level of My Father, the Level Above Human, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n\n\nToday's Christians say they are Christians and think they are Christians. And yet they seldom quote the most important things that Jesus said. Jesus said, `If you want to know My Father, if you want to move into My Father's Kingdom, then shed everything of this world - leave everything behind - and come and follow Me. And unless you hate everything of this world, your sister, your mother, your brother - everything of this world - you will not know the Kingdom of Heaven. You have to graft to Me, you have to cling to Me, if I am to literally take you into My Father's house.' Most Christians, world over, mostly frequently quote Paul - who never sat with that Representative (Jesus), nor was Paul ever a student of that Representative. Christians say, \"Oh, I love Jesus. He's in my heart. I'm filled with Jesus. Jesus wants me to live an abundant human life. He wants me to have riches. He wants me to have more children so that I can bring them up with Christian family values.\" I don't remember Jesus ever saying that, \"What I want you to do is to go get married, have families, have children, and together bring all of them and I will take them into the Kingdom of Heaven.\" He only spoke to individuals - and said, `The only way out of here is for you to know that as an individual this human world is not for you - that tie that binds you to the human kingdom is not for you. If you know it is not for you, then come to Me - and My Father will feed Me information that can nourish you - and help you overcome this world - and we'll leave this world, and we'll go to My Father's Kingdom.'\n\n\n\nRemember, we're not talking about a spiritual kingdom - no clouds, no harps - even though we are talking about in the heavens. But the Heavens are no more spiritual than when you go out at night and look at the Heavenly bodies and see them. They are literally there. They are physical. My Father's Kingdom also moves or travels in spacecrafts (some of which are even organic). You could say, \"Oh, my goodness, that's outrageous.\" Well, you don't like the illustrations of chariots of fire or wheel within a wheel? You don't like the illustrations that are in your religious literature that tell of spacecrafts of my Father's Kingdom? \"Clouds of light\" - at that time they didn't know what else to call them. Even when they saw angels that they said had wings - how else could they have described that they fly? That didn't necessarily mean they had feathers on their backs (though that possibility exists as well). Certainly some of these illustrations mean that they came to Earth in a flying object and they left aboard that flying object. And when they saw Jesus ascend, they said, \"He went up into that cloud of light.\"\n\n\n\nNow, I'm not trying to make a big deal over the means of transportation issue. For a spacecraft - belonging to the Level Above Human - is much more than a piece of transportation. It is a very valuable work station. It is commonly a place of service to the Level Above Human. These students that are leaving this kingdom level to go with me to my Father's Kingdom, to my Father's house, these will not go into houses on some planet like Earth, and reproduce, and have families and sit and watch television and make scrambled eggs. They're going to be genderless individuals, in service - full time - for whatever need the Level Above Human, the Kingdom of Heaven has for them. And the tools they use, the workstations that they use are spacecrafts - all sizes. Spacecrafts that are so small that a very small crew could fit into them because that small spacecraft is best suited for that given task. Spacecrafts that are so large you can't even see the outer extremities of them. They could look like something larger than a planet to the observers, because that size craft is best suited for whatever laboratory work or experimentation is going on. All sizes are used for a variety of purposes.\n\n\n\nHow can these students be effective servants in that Kingdom if they're worried about their children, or their dogs, or their horses, or their cats, or how much time they have to put in at the Rotary, or such things as that. As individuals they serve one or two individuals - older Representatives of that Next Kingdom - who are their instructors for their assigned tasks. Just as in the task that we're in now with this classroom - these look to me as their Older Member, their instructor, for everything. I look to my Older Member for everything - to fill me in on what these students' needs are and how I might be used to instruct them. I'm not just talking about their physical needs, but their mental/spirit/soul needs - how they can most effectively make their change from human into the Kingdom Level Above Human.\n\n\n\nNow, this is not to say that we know that there is a guarantee that we will all go on board a craft together, in order to leave before this spading under occurs. We will definitely go on board a craft to leave before the \"spading under\" occurs. You could say, \"Well, what's the difference?\" Well, the difference is that we don't yet know if we are going to take these flesh bodies on board that craft or if we will leave these flesh bodies behind before we board. We don't believe that Our Father's Kingdom has much need for these flesh bodies. But, it's possible that a spacecraft will come down, and we'll walk on board that craft, and they'll take these bodies from us, and issue us the ones that belong to that Level so that we might begin our service. It is also possible that part of our test of faith is our hating this world, even our flesh body, to the extent to be willing to leave it without any proof of the Next Level's existence, other than what we have come to know: that we have nothing to fear; that we are in Good keeping; that we can leave the body that we're in and Be that soul, that identity, which totally survives that separation - whether it is by martyrdom, because someone went crazy over our \"righteous blasphemy,\" or whatever event that might separate us from that human body that we are wearing. Our faith is primarily based upon our trust in our Older Members. We do know one thing - we don't care to cling to the life of this body until it naturally \"gives up.\" We don't care to be aborted by the body that we're wearing. We care more to abort it in proof to our Heavenly Father that we trust Him and are ready to leave this place. We're ready to go into His Kingdom. And they, these students, have to say to my Father, \"We trust your Son. We trust the One You sent for our sakes. Even so much that we have no hesitation to leave this place - to leave the body that we are wearing. We know that whatever happens to us after we leave this body is a step forward from what we were, and that we don't care to be here any longer.\"\n\n\n\nEarlier in this tape I spoke to you of three types of individuals who can be salvaged from this re-spading. One type that I mentioned was those who have overcome enough that they will get an issue of a physical body belonging to the Next Level, and go into service, as a crew member, working for the Next Level. A second type of individual that can be salvaged from this planet at this time are those who don't quite reach that point of overcoming by the time it is time to leave. But they are still faithful to the best of their ability in their effort of breaking away, leaving their humanity, and looking to us - looking to me, looking to my Father, looking to the Next Level - to give them the strength and the understanding of how they can break away more quickly. So wherever they are, to the best of their capability, at the time of our exit, even if they are not ready for issue of a Next Level body - they may have to experience a time in a civilization that is yet to come and do more overcoming of the human kingdom. But they will be in the keeping of the Kingdom Level Above Human, just as these have been in the keeping of the Kingdom Level Above Human - not just here at this time, in this generation, with me and with Ti.\n\n\n\n\"Ti\" isn't Ti's name, by the way. \"Do\" isn't Do's name. I'm not even given to tell you what my name or Ti's name is. The Next Level wouldn't have humans know what our real names are. I had to put that in for the record, so that you would understand.\n\n\n\nBack to the previous subject, the second type of individual who can go into the Kingdom of Heaven is one who, at the time we leave, has not completed their human overcoming to the satisfaction of the Next Level, and therefore the Next Level will bring them back when a civilization is at its development point to be a \"match\" - at the point where those individuals might pick up where they left off. Then they will reach \"issue time\" for a Next Level body by or before the end of the next civilization.\n\n\n\nThe third type of soul or individual who can go to the Kingdom of Heaven now, with us, and be in the keeping of that Kingdom, are those who either hear our voice right at the end of our task, or have received this information and don't know where it's coming from. In other words, some might hear our voice and might know where it is coming from, might know that I exist in physical form here, about to leave. Others might not make contact, but something tells them, \"I've got to break away, I can't stand to stay here. I've got to put my life on the line for the Kingdom of Heaven.\"\n\n\n\nThe lower forces' whole effort is to have potential members of the Next Level not succeed in remaining faithful to the end so that they might prevent them from coming into the keeping of the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n\n\nSo, here we are. We're going public with this information once again, right before we leave. This is like putting ourselves right out on the chopping block where the lower forces will have a chance to try to demean us, have the world turn against us, and try to do us in. It will challenge all those who are religious minded to look at us and say, \"Hmmm, how could that possibly be the Truth, is this not the Anti-Christ or the spurious Messiah?\" \"Spurious Messiah\" is the term that some prominent television/satellite ministries use in describing the Anti-Christ, who, they say, is to arrive on the scene before Christ returns. So, in their eyes, since the Anti-Christ has not yet arrived, then Christ's return must be at a later time. Well, I hate to tell you, but the Anti-Christ - the spurious Messiah - has been on the scene ever since my Father and I left 2000 years ago. And he and his helpers have worked as hard as they could through religions, through governments, through \"acceptable\" morality, through \"responsibility as a human,\" to brainwash humans to expect \"Heaven on Earth.\" Those lower forces have \"programmed\" humans, especially Christians, to see our arrival \"on the scene\" as the Anti-Christ. Those fallen angels - those humanoid space aliens - would have humans not look to or expect to go to a Kingdom of Heaven, but to look for a Heaven on Earth - where they might reign as your Christ - to work toward the future - to be preoccupied with replicating or reproducing children - and laying aside enough money to take care of those children so that they will have a future, and they will have a future, and they will have a future. A future in what? - the human kingdom? What an abomination! To the Next Level the human kingdom is, at its best, nothing more than a potential steppingstone. It's clear that anyone who wants to stay in the human kingdom - and make it some sort of divinity - is looking to some \"spurious Messiah,\" an anti-Christ indeed.\n\n\n\nNow, I know that those who are expecting the arrival of the \"spurious Messiah\" - \"the anti-Christ\" - if they become aware of this tape and of Do sitting here saying what I'm saying now, they'll say, \"That's the one. Because I warned you that the spurious Messiah would say, `I'll take you out of here. I'll rapture you into my father's kingdom.' \" And that's what I'm saying. I'm saying that, \"If you can believe my Father's information, if you can believe the Truth that we share with you, and if you believe it enough that you can put your trust in me - and that could be a \"big dose\" for some - you will soon find yourself in the safekeeping of the Kingdom of Heaven.\" These students in front of me know me well. If you have some of my Father's mind in you, you can have recognition as well, even with only this brief viewing, though I'll remind you that the lower forces will do everything they can to have you lose or doubt that recognition.\n\n\n\nWe have a website now, you know, it's the popular thing - everybody has to have a website. Our website on the Internet is called Heavensgate. Heavensgate - oh, of course, .com. Everything is .com. We're not .org, we're .com. So if you want to, you can learn more about who we are, what we have to say, what I have to say, what my Older Member can share with you through what we have said, and know of our history. We have nothing to hide. Even though to some, we might be a dangerous cult. We understand that. Why dangerous? Because we threaten the family, we threaten the established norm of family values. If you knew Jesus 2000 years ago, you would know that exactly the same thing occurred. And that the reason for getting rid of Him was because if people really began to follow Him to any significant degree, it would threaten the political, and certainly the religious norm. His teachings were clearly against what the mainstream was teaching, what the norm was in the governments or the family, and certainly against the religion of that time.\n\n\n\nReligion today is an interesting thing. Remember how we said a moment ago that the religious literature like the Bible, the Koran, the Torah, are time manuals. In the time that something was written, as the Lord or as God related to man, it was appropriate for them at that time. And yet we have the bulk (if not the vast majority) of humans on the planet today who are very religious living exactly as they were trying to live some 5000 years ago, or some 4000 years ago. They never made it to 2000 years ago. But 2000 years ago, a chance to get out of here, was available to those who listened to what the Next Level's Representative had to say. A chance to get out of here - out of the human kingdom - whenever it is offered, requires everything of you - that you, as an individual, go join some cult - that you leave everything behind - that you ignore the members of your family - that you ignore the responsibility to your community - that you ignore your career - and that hearts will be broken.\n\n\n\nI don't mean to make light of that, \"that hearts will be broken.\" I know that hearts are broken. I also know that anyone who leaves to go to my Father's Kingdom, that any heart that is broken in the process of that transition, can easily be more than healed, if that heart looks to my Father for healing, and looks to my Father for understanding. That soul does not need to see this as a terrible experience. Many times, the worst things in the human kingdom that can happen to us, end up being the best things that could happen to us. Because we learn \"in depth\" lessons as a result of those difficult times. Every life that was touched by these who are sitting in front of me - every life that was hurt or experienced pain by their leaving and becoming students of mine and of my Father's - was hurt, severely hurt. Some of them still hurt. They could actually say, \"Thank you, God, for the lesson that is mine to learn in this experience. And as far as that individual that I used to call my son or daughter, or my husband or wife, I put them in Your trust. I cannot tell them what they must do with their life. That is their decision.\"\n\n\n\nWe cannot judge each other. I cannot judge you. I don't care to judge you. You will judge yourselves by how you respond to what we have to say, by what you can accept and what you can't. In some cases, it's almost better that you never see me, or hear what we say, for that will put you to the test of whether or not you will condemn me, whether or not you will judge me. You cannot hurt me. You cannot hurt these. We can only be hurt if we displease our Heavenly Father.\n\n\n\nIt's funny that the world - the mainstream human world - is so quick to condemn and judge (those who are not like them) as if they were God Almighty. They would also judge those who would follow us, determining the worthlessness of any that would join some cult, assuming that that is the worst thing that anyone could possibly do, for they are being brainwashed and led down the wrong track into some occult camp, and they're going to the devil. What is the devil like? Know your literature. What do the fallen angels like? They like the pleasures of the human flesh - the aspirations of this world.\n\n\n\nWhat is told to you in all religious literature - that you will find if you ever reach the Kingdom of Heaven? There, there will be no males, no females, no children, no families other than your relationship with God - your Lord. Your Lord is whichever Member of His Kingdom He has given to you, assigned to you as your Helper, your Instructor, your Teacher. This is so simple that it sounds unreal-unspiritual. This information would be easier to accept if it were more spiritual, if it were more complicated, if it had more ritual with it, or more trappings of religion. In my Father's house, no incense is required, no flowing robes, no tinkling bells, no genuflecting, no sitting in the lotus position, no things of \"spirituality,\" even though our Father's Kingdom requires cleansing of the spirit/the mind. It requires ridding ourselves of the mind of the human kingdom - ridding ourselves of the lusts of the human world, and of the binds to the human level.\n\n\n\n\"Being filled with spirit\" is an interesting thing for you to think about. What happened when the illustration was made that Jesus was with John the Baptist, and was being baptized, and a dove descended and He was \"filled with the Holy Spirit\"? \"Filled with the Holy Spirit\" meant that the major portion of Jesus' mind, His Next Level identity, was entering the body that He was wearing to the degree that the vehicle's human mind was no longer affecting Him - He had aborted that mind of the human kingdom. He was \"filled\" with the mind of His Father. The mind of His Father is \"Holy Spirit.\" Any mind of the Level Above Human is pure Spirit - is Holy Spirit. To think of \"being filled with the Holy Spirit\" as something that comes- and- knocks- you- down- and- makes- you- fall- on- the- floor- because- somebody- is- trying- to- heal- your- broken- knee, is an abomination. It is anything but the \"Holy Spirit\" that you're being \"filled with.\" Likewise, to \"babble\" in some indiscernible \"mumbo-jumbo\" and call it \"speaking in tongues\" or \"being filled with the Holy Spirit\" is also an outrage. It might be an experience of being \"filled with the spirit,\" but it certainly is not the Holy Spirit.\n\n\n\nYou know, a soul is another very interesting thing, because my Father's Kingdom plants souls. And souls become the great separator as they are planted. My Father's Kingdom plants souls in many humans each time a Representative of the Kingdom Level Above Human is to be incarnate on planet Earth - plants many souls in many human plants. Now, even though they're planted in the flesh, because the flesh is what has to be overcome, they are really planted in the spirit of that flesh. The spirit being the mind or the intelligence of that flesh. And you can say, \"Well, does that mean that everybody doesn't have a soul?\" Yes, that's exactly what it means. But it also means that anybody can have a soul that can believe in my Father - the reality of my Father, the reality of His Son, and the reality of His Kingdom.\n\n\n\nIn other words, those who are given the responsibility and the task of planting those souls, plant them in all of the human plants who have a potential of making that step - using that steppingstone - and getting out of the human kingdom and into that Next Kingdom Level. That soul, as the separator, helps the individual, in their mind (in their spirit), abort human thinking, human evaluation, human behavior, and replace it with the mind that they get from the Representatives - the mind of the Next Level - fill it up, fill it up, fill it up. When it is so filled and enough aborting of human mind has occurred - then that individual has come into viability - has come into bloom enough that that individual is ready to go to \"quartermaster\" when they leave this planet, and be issued a body, of service, belonging to the Kingdom of my Father.\n\n\n\nNow, let me say this: all human plants - even in their genetic structure - have a little bit of Heavenly mind, or mind of the Kingdom of God, mind of the Evolutionary Level Above Human (I have to say all of those each time I say it, just to remind you I'm talking about the same thing). Each human plant has a little bit of that Next Level mind in it. So theoretically, and this is true, that if there is a human listening to me who, in fact, may not at this moment have a soul, but that plant listens to me, and says, \"Could it be true, what Do is saying? It sounds crazy, but I wonder if that's true?\" Even that degree of curiosity would attract the attention of the Next Level crew which is assigned to planting souls. That crew will be sure that a separator (a soul) is immediately made available to that individual. So that deposit of a soul could happen very, very quickly. They're not going to let it happen, that any potential recipients of their Kingdom not have the needed receptacle of Next Level spirit coming into full blossom as pure spirit, pure mind, of the Kingdom of Heaven.\n\n\n\nNow, let's go back to the topic of urgency. I don't know if you are aware that a great deal of literature used by many scholars today, says that the calendar that humans use is off by 4 years. And that Jesus was born in 4 B.C. Now, if Jesus was born in 4 B.C., and this is '96 A.D., could this be the year 2000 - the millenium, the beginning of the end? That's why we're talking. For us to surface with who we are and the information that we are surfacing with, we know, could challenge you to want to squelch us. It's interesting that we see the world - we see the world - as the anti-Truth, the anti-Christ, the spurious Messiah. The world - those who want to stay in the world - will see us as anti-Truth, anti-Christ, spurious Messiah. We're prepared for that. We know that that is inevitable at this time. That was inevitable 2000 years ago - that is what found Jesus sentenced to die on a cross.\n\n\n\nRemember, we said that the third type of person who can actually be salvaged at the end, can be taken into the keeping of the Next Level, simply because they believe in what we say. That simple belief is what occurred in the mind of the thief who was on the cross next to Jesus. When Jesus recognized his belief, He told him that, `this day he would, upon their departure, be with Him in paradise.' He knew that he seriously believed. And He knew that is all that it took - is for him to believe who He was. Even believing Him in a condition when He was being killed as a heretic - against the Church, against the system. The Church today certainly will see us as against the Church. The Church of today is not of God. Though once the true followers - the Church - were of God. The only true Church of today are those who are connected with the present existence of the Next Level, the Kingdom of God, the Kingdom of Heaven - and the Representative from that Kingdom.\n\n\n\nThis time is so exciting to us, even though we know that it is close to our end, and that is why it is exciting to us. We don't expect to or want to build a Church on this planet. We don't want any gothic Cathedral. We don't want any membership roll. We don't want to help you reproduce so that we have more children to put on the Sunday school roll in our Church. We are a group of believers in the Kingdom Level Above Human, who want to leave and enter that Kingdom, and become of significant service to that Kingdom.\n\n\n\nThis does not mean that when in the human kingdom, that a strong humanitarian drive is not a healthy thing. Because really a strong humanitarian drive is motivated to improve. But if you could only see that a human condition is a temporary condition, a steppingstone, an opportunity to get out of this kingdom, then you could accept this Truth. This is as scientific - this is as true as true could be - but you have to know me, you have to trust me, you have to believe me. Some can know me now. Some can even know me for the first time when they see this tape and say, \"I don't know what there is, but there's something in my head that makes me know that fellow, and makes me know that what he's saying is true. And I may be wrong, but I'm going to try to find more out and see if that's what I need to be a part of. Because I know that this Earth has become something that is not where I belong.\"\n\n\n\nIt's funny - not funny - it's really sad that a segment of my Father's Kingdom, in particular my personal Heavenly Father, related to a community that is today considered the early Jewish community, and worked with them preparing them for my presence here 2000 years ago and now. And yet, the Jewish community of then and now, would certainly see me as anything but a Representative of God. The Muslims, who are considered by some to be the enemy of the Judeo-Christians, many of them have sustained a more real connection with God - with some higher standards of behavior, and with more restraint. You know, one of my students reminded me just today that they came in contact with a Muslim who said, \"Look, you know you people of the West have a wrong idea of what we are. We don't praise Mohammed. We don't worship Mohammed. We consider Mohammed a prophet of many prophets. Many of the books of our literature are about Jesus. And I say, `Great is God' more than 50 times a day, because God means so much to me.\" God means so much to many of them that they are more modest in the clothing that they wear. Many are more on guard against sensuality and \"worldly\" things. God means so much to many of them that they are willing to die for God and justify that frame of mind more quickly than they would a willingness to die for nation, or die for world. I'm not saying that Muslims are the ones who are going to inherit God's Kingdom any more than anyone else. In the eyes of the Kingdom of Heaven, there's no such thing as race or color or religious background. It doesn't matter - none of it matters. If the extent of your religious background was Star Trek - that in itself could be the best background you could have, if you could accept this as Truth, if you could accept this as reality.\n\n\n\nThis is a test time. You could easily say, \"Here's a little bitty classroom, with some old fellow with a prune face sitting here, calling himself Do, saying, `I'm a Representative of the Kingdom of God.' How can I believe that?\" If you have some of my Father's mind in you, you will have some recognition of us and this information. Even though once you recognize me, the forces of this world will dive in with all their might to have you lose that recognition, to have you not trust me, to have you come to your senses, and come back into the service of this world.\n\n\n\nI hope this tape session with you will be the beginning of our relationship. If this tape session is used to validate your seeing us as anti-God, the Anti-Christ, so be it. That's part of what we expect. That's part of the necessity of what comes at this time. It's the common thing for us to see each other as opposites of what we believe we are.\n\n\n\nI'm so happy, because my time is short here. If you come with us, your time here can be shortened. When Jesus left 2000 years ago - or the one who was in Jesus, or when I left 2000 years ago - only a very short time after that, Truth was significantly corrupted. So that no matter who tried to use the name of \"Jesus,\" or of \"Christ,\" or His information - seeing it as true, seeing it as real, referring to what had been said of what it takes to come into my Kingdom - that fell apart, that deteriorated, that became unimportant. It's a miracle that His Teachings can still be found in the gospels - they're still there - you'd be amazed, you should read them again. Likewise this time, after I'm gone, when we leave, when we enter into my Father's spacecraft in order to go into service in His Kingdom, the Truth will deteriorate as fast as we depart. It will leave this atmosphere within a very short time.\n\n\n\nI hope for your sake that you will, at least, ponder this - don't ask your neighbors, your friends, what they think of this. Instead, go into the privacy of your \"closet\" and see if you can connect with the purest, highest source that you might consider \"God,\" and ask: \"What about this? Is this information for real? Is this for me? If it is, then please give me the strength I need to pursue it.\" As soon as you tell anyone else, they will likely be used by the lower forces as their instruments to have you not believe, to have you stay in this world and wait for the \"Heaven on Earth.\"\n\n\n\nWe hope to be of some service to you in this short time before our departure. We believe it to be a very short time. So our thoughts will be of you. We hope that your thoughts will be of our Father's Kingdom.\n\n\n\n.",

      "about": "ドイツの作曲家、ピアニスト。西洋美術音楽における古典時代とロマン派時代の間の移行の重要な人物であり、彼はすべての作曲家の中で最も有名で影響力のある人のひとりです。彼の最もよく知られた作品には、交響曲、ピアノ協奏曲、ヴァイオリン協奏曲、ピアノソナタ、弦楽四重奏、ミサ・ミリア・ソルムニズム、フィデリオなどがある。\n\n\n\nケルン帝国議会の首都であり、神聖ローマ帝国の一部であるボンで生まれたベートーベンは、幼い頃に音楽才能を披露し、父親ヨハン・ファン・ベートーヴェンと作曲家指揮者によって指導されたウィーンでヨセフ・ハイドンとのコンポジションを学び、名器のピアニストとして評判を得ました。彼は死ぬまでウィーンに住んでいた。彼の後半までに彼の聴覚は悪化し始め、彼の人生の最後の10年間で彼はほとんど完全にろう者だった。彼は演奏と公演を断念しましたが、作曲を続けました。彼の最も賞賛された作品の多くは、彼の人生のこれらの最後の年から来ています。",

This Album is a tribute to that project, and I guess a kind of alchemical marriage between that project and this one. \n\n\n\nYes I know I'm thinking too hard about it, but still \"Please very enjoy because beautiful special for people\" and so on. \n\n\n\nhypergiantsasmr.bandcamp.com/music",
