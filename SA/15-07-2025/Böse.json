We liked sometimes to change instruments, switch between guitars, bass and drums. This day we had two nice guitars, so we decided to play with two guitars. Plan was, that we will make some new project. Hammond was recorded month later and by the week the first mix was done. But then we made another Böse session and forget about this...\n\n\n\nFive years later session was accidentally found on one of our computers. It was February 2020. We were try to remind some details from this session, but all that we know is, that we had a great time :)\n\n\n\nSession is not possible to edit now, so we have only some WAV files from the past mix. Enjoy our noise!",
