      "about": "E H I\n\nA Fear Of Staircases\n\noriginally released on cassette in 1994\n\non the F.D.R. Tapes label\n\nF.D.R. Tapes #7\n\nDes Moines, Iowa, USA\n\n\n\nE H I was the main solo recording project of Brian Noring.\n\nCheap consumer keyboards, guitar, samples, drum machine, tape experiments, homemade lo-fi tape goodness!\n\nThe spaces between the letters in the artist name E H I are correct. Noring told me that E H I stands for \"Extreme Head Injury\".\n\n\n\nThe F.D.R. Tapes label (later F.D.R. Recordings) was a classic label operated by Brian Noring of Des Moines, Iowa from 1994 through 2008. During that time Noring released 190 cassettes and CDRs, which included solo and collaborative works, as well as compilations. F.D.R. was every bit as essential in the 1990s wave of cassette labels as any label from the previous decade.\n\n\n\nOn his F.D.R. Recordings list on the Rate Your Music site Brian Noring wrote this about A Fear Of Staircases:\n\n\"The title is a reference to a nasty fall I took from the top of our staircase. 17 pieces most in the three and four minute range, but constructed from hours of actual recording and layering techniques. Format switches from keyboard pieces, tape manipulations, more experimental pieces and more often than not - a combination of all the above. Although I was listening to plenty of noise music at the time, this tape still reflects my interests in old industrial projects with just about every track having a beat of some kind. Things were soon to change. One of FDR's most distributed titles.\" \n\nrateyourmusic.com/list/bnoring/f_d_r__recordings/\n\n\n\n SIDE ONE\n\n1. Propaganda\n\n2. Tumble Dry\n\n3. Again They March\n\n4. Over and Over\n\n5. Typhoon\n\n6. Haze\n\n7. Pulled Together\n\n8. Shut In\n\n9. Awakened\n\n\n\nSIDE TWO\n\n1. A Fear Of Staircases\n\n2. T.I.A.\n\n3. Baptized\n\n4. Microphone Ice Cream\n\n5. Distressed\n\n6. Supreme Love\n\n7. Machine Slavery\n\n8. Stuffed\n\n\n\nThe audio transcriptions were created from Copy #49 of A Fear Of Staircases.\n\n\n\nIndividual tracks are 24-bit transcriptions. Track separations might not be perfect.\n\n\n\nIncluded are 16-bit transcriptions of the entire tape sides so that you can experience A Fear Of Staircases as side-long listening experiences just like you would have in 1994.\n\n\n\nother F.D.R.

      "about": "GOF 003\n\nDiary of a Shiteater\n\n​by Girls Who Hate Their Mothers and The Chicken Fucks\n\n1983\n\n\n\nvisit a special info page about Diary of a Shiteater and see additional artwork and liner notes by Leslie Singer: \n\nwww.haltapes.com/diary-of-a-shiteater.html\n\n\n\n Leslie Singer:\n\n\n\nDiary of a Shiteater is a volcanic bubble of cut up samples and songs by me, Girls on Fire, with my old bandmates, who were then in the second incarnation of Psychodrama (Brett, Rob and Mark), plus snippets by other artistes and found audio —— All put through the metaphorical meat grinder with audio levels pushed into the red even more than The Velvets' White Light/White Heat, and blown out speakers crackling with distortion. Very demonic. Like a horror movie version of the documentation of the John Cage/David Tudor performance of Variations IV recorded at the Feigen/Palmer Gallery in 1963; with the distorted voices and art opening/party conversation.\n\n\n\nBrett and Rob would send me cassette tapes and I interspersed them with the stuff I was coming up with. I don't think that I sent them the tape in advance to review or approve before it went out into the world. I also don't remember their reactions to the tape either. However, I do think that Brett came up with the name \"The Chicken Fucks\" and I definitely remember coming up with the name \"Girls Who Hate Their Mothers\". I think that we went with the different names because both of those names seemed more even more aggressive to us like the cut-up process/sounds on the tape than even Psychodrama or Girls on Fire.\n\n\n\nincludes the Girls On Fire songs—\n\n“I Wish I was Andy Warhol”\n\n“I Feel Sad About Tennessee Williams”\n\n“Eva Hesse”\n\n“My Telephone”\n\n“Sylvia Plath was Smart”\n\n“Cindy Sherman”\n\n“Beautiful Sexy Luscious Car Crashes”\n\n\n\ndigitized from Leslie Singer's original cassette master, \n\nby Hal McGee, June 2019\n\n\n\nthis archival reissue of Diary of a Shiteater\n\nis authorized by Leslie Singer of Girls On Fire\n\n\n\nalbum cover artwork from Little Fyodor's personal copy of the cassette that he received directly from Leslie in the 1980s.",

      "about": "I THINK ABOUT JACKSON POLLOCK by GIRLS ON FIRE is presented here in an archival reissue version authorized and with the full cooperation of Leslie Singer of Girls On Fire.\n\n\n\nIn October of 1982 Leslie Singer moved from the Washington, D.C. area (where she had been a member of the earliest incarnation of Psychodrama) to San Francisco. I THINK ABOUT JACKSON POLLOCK was her first solo cassette release under her newly-created moniker of Girls On Fire.\n\n\n\nOriginally released in early 1983, I THINK ABOUT JACKSON POLLOCK is an awe-inspiring cascade, avalanche, raging torrent waterfall of stream of consciousness WORDS WORDS WORDS, accompanied by minimalist no wave-styled guitar noise minimalism.\n\n\n\nLeslie and I invite you to visit an informational page about I THINK ABOUT JACKSON POLLOCK: \n\nwww.haltapes.com/i-think-about-jackson-pollock.html\n\n On that page you will find extensive archaeological evidence including liner notes and a personal history of the tape by Singer, maps, videos, scans of the tape, and more.\n\n\n\nSuffice to say, I loved the tape. It seems like Singer couldn't hold back the words and thoughts and images. The subject matter seems to be fairly evenly split between her memories of events, sensations, happenings and things that people said and did back in Virginia and all of the new sensations she was experiencing after having moved to San Francisco. Subject matter includes Jackson Pollock, car crashes, laundromats, riding the city bus, riding the subway, stuff her boss said at her office in San Francisco's Financial District, something about how everybody she knew back home had cancer ... I think there's even something about margarine!\n\n\n\nLeslie Singer's five Girls On Fire cassettes in the 1980s incorporated elements of pop, conceptual and performance art; as well as doses of hardcore punk and lo-fi experimentalism; and even contains traces of progressive rock. Her music and films prefigured Harsh Noise and Riot Grrrls. But it's ALL LESLIE. Nobody else sounded like this back then! Her personality and life are stamped all over this!\n\n\n\nSee the 300 Days Of Sodom archival reissue, also authorized by Singer, here on Bandcamp: \n\ncassetteartclassics.bandcamp.com/album/300-days-of-sodom-enhanced\n\n\n\n The audio is taken from a direct transcription from Al Margolis' personal copy of I THINK ABOUT JACKSON POLLOCK that Leslie Singer sent to Margolis in the 1980s.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the individual songs included here are transcriptions of the entire sides of the cassette so that you can experience the tape sides as continuous listening experiences.\n\n\n\nHal McGee\n\nHalTapes",

      "about": "Hear the ROAR of Mountains\n\nTwo-volume cassette compilation (C-90 and C-60) and booklet\n\n© 1985 audiofile Tapes\n\nThis set is a by-product of ARTITUDE\n\n—the audiofile magazine.\n\nCarl Howard—A/a Bayside, New York, USA\n\n(now Columbus, Ohio)\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, November 19, 2020 I removed Track 15: Smersh - This House at the request of the artist.\n\n\n\nHear the ROAR of Mountains\n\nVolume One\n\naudiofile Tapes —C-90/AT2A\n\n\n\nHear the ROAR of Mountains\n\nVolume Two\n\naudiofile Tapes —C-60/AT2B\n\n\n\nAll tracks C+P 1985 by the artists except Nomuzic in which no ownership may exist, and Audio Leter which is anti-copyright. Compilation ©1985 by audiofile Tapes.\n\n\n\nThis archival reissue has been authorized by Carl Howard, the compilation producer.\n\n\n\nThe audio files are direct digital transcriptions from Hal McGee’s personal copy of Hear the ROAR of Mountains, which he received directly from Carl Howard in 1985.\n\n\n\nI did my best to divide the tracks by the different artists correctly from the original continuous tape sides, but I am not completely sure that I did it properly. Sometimes there is only a second or two between the tracks on the tapes; and some of the tracks have ‘false endings’ or silences or gaps near the beginning or end, which makes it difficult to know where one track ends and the next begins. Such was the nature of many 1980s cassette compilations! Carl Howard, the original compilation producer, helped me to figure out some troublesome track divisions, but there are others which might not be correct. Only ‘god’ knows for sure.\n\n—Hal McGee, archival reissue producer\n\n\n\nThe booklet and cassette covers were scanned from McGee’s copy of the compilation. Scans of the original booklet pages were edited to remove age-discolorations, fold-lines, bumps and wrinkles, and re-formatted for the included PDF booklet.",

      "about": "HalTapes presents:\n\nInternational Electronic Music Association\n\nI.E.M.A. Collective Group Tape #1\n\n\n\nOriginally distributed on cassette in 1981\n\nby Anvil Creations\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\ncompilation produced by Ken Moore\n\n\n\nThis archival issue of this cassette art classic is authorized by the producer, Ken Moore.\n\nJanuary 29, 2016\n\n\n\nThanks to Brian Lunger for providing scans of the cover, insert, and tape.\n\n\n\n© 1981 I.E.M.A.\n\n\n\nThe International Electronic Music Association was formed in 1979 by James E. Finch in Salamanca, New York. Jim had a vision, about electronic music, about how synthesizer users all around the world could somehow communicate with one another, and share their ideas and possibly review recordings and even interview musicians who wanted to take their art to a public level. That vision began with a newsletter, which later turned into a zine called SYNE. \n\n\n\nSoon after this newsletter began to catch on, with members of amateur and professional musicians signing up, Jim decided he wanted to be able to share the sounds these people were producing, himself included, but there was no internet then, just the postal service. So he gathered some music from several music enthusiasts, myself included, and put together a tape that would be distributed at a fair market price to anyone who wanted to sample these new electronic sounds. It was advertised in SYNE, and the tape was met with great enthusiasm among all the members if the I.E.M.A.!\n\n\n\nAs Jim Finch had so many responsibilities and wanted to expand the newsletter, at an early meeting of some of the more local members, it was decided that someone else needed to take control of this \"Group Tape\" project. It was decided, because of the fine quality of my own cassette tapes I had distributed as Anvil Creations, that I would become the new Music Director. The first thing I did was to draw up a cover for this first effort, and some really fine names appeared on this release, including Jonn Serrie, whose name we misspelled, and Leon Lowman, whose records are now available through Vinyl-on-Demand. \n\n\n\nThis was the beginning of a short series of compilation releases that was met with widespread approval. I hope that you enjoy these recordings, as they have remained dormant for the past 35 years, and certainly deserve the admirable attention that Hal has given to them in this digital format.\n\n\n\nKen Moore\n\nAnvil Creations Director",

      "about": "Notes For “Just Sittin’ Around The House”\n\nwritten by Evan Cantor\n\n\n\nOriginal cassette liner indicates:\n\n\n\nc. 1987 all songs by Evan Cantor\n\nall instruments by Evan Cantor; recorded in March & April 1987\n\n1005 Marine St. Boulder CO 80302 (postal address at that time)\n\nSOP 106, Sound of Pig Music c/o Al Margolis, 28 Bellingham Lane, Great Neck NY 11023 USA\n\n\n\nGeneral Notes: At the time of WoG’s break-up, I was concerned about how my musicianship was being perceived by the underground. Despite all the myths about Walls Of Genius being idiot-savants wailing away with no musical background or chops, I was feeling un-appreciated for all the musical chops I brought to the table. For instance, I could sing in many different voices, but everybody seemed to think those voices were Little Fyodor, or so I perceived. So I was ready to assert a part of myself that had been subsumed by Walls Of Genius. “Just Sittin’ Around The House” became a sort of “All Things Must Pass” for me, music that had been literally been ‘sittin’ around the house’ for years. Although I received positive reviews for this album, I realized, or thought, that this wasn’t really the kind of music that was in synch with the cassette underground of the 80s. For me it may have been experimental—yes, I was experimenting with different tunings, but primarily the tunes are very conventional. A lot of tunes like this were incorporated into Walls Of Genius titles, but they had always been engineered to be “odd” or “off-beat” in some way, something “experimental”. At the time of the WoG break-up, I needed something conventional. Not only was I concerned over the perception of my musician-ship, I also feared that the Walls Of Genius “scene” would banish me forever to a life lived on the fringes of society, that if I continued with it I would never have a satisfactory sex life again and never meet anybody but the weirdest members of a small segment of society. So, in some sense, “Just Sittin’ Around The House” was an effort to counter-act all that. But not long afterwards, I dropped out of the underground scene, believing that nothing would ever come of it in the future. I’ve said it before, but I’ll say it again: I was wrong. In any case, the recordings I made subsequent to this album were not, as far as I can recall, introduced to the Cassette Culture underground. I made a series of recordings starting with “Hell Is Empty…”, which focused on more original material, and then “Chestnuts” and “Straight Covers”, both of which were cover versions of classic rockabilly and top-40 songs. My recollection is that none of these recordings were presented to the Cassette Culture, although I would have distributed some of them to friends and family. As I have a nagging memory of somebody saying something nice about my version of “Love Potion #9”, I may be remembering this inaccurately.\n\n\n\nSongs:\n\n\n\nJeff Coat’s Couch: this song is an inspired tribute to one of my fraternity brothers, Jim, a mutual friend of mine and the soon-to-be ‘Little Fyodor’. Jim was an iconic party animal, a kind of southern-fried Belushi-like character, interested in techniques for both mind expansion and mind erasing. The lyrics here reflect a portrait of the man. Unfortunately and not particularly surprising, Jim experienced substance abuse problems later in his life which no doubt caused him a great deal of grief. I have not been in touch with Jim since that time. Later on, my wife, Robin, used the lyrics as a “poem” in one of her college writing classes and, lo-and-behold, the instructor finally liked something she had ‘written’ and gave her an ‘A’ on the poem. The music itself was the result of my experiments with finger-picking, open tuning and slide.\n\n\n\nKathryn’s Song: this song was written during my time with The Blitz Bunnies in Fairfax, Virginia, in 1980. The Blitz Bunnies was a punk-rock band attempt, which included members of local bands The Young Turds and The Nurses. We played only one memorable gig, at American University in Washington D.C. It might be of passing interest that the soon-to-be ‘Little Fyodor’ attended that one concert. Bass player Tim Carter would go on to play with The French Are From Hell, along with Kevin Landes, the saxophone player with whom I would shortly collaborate on jazz standards as The Mystic Knights Of The Sea. At one of the Blitz Bunnies’ band practices, drummer Harry’s girlfriend complained that we never played any “pretty songs”. So I wrote a pretty song for her. The Blitz Bunnies never played it as the band broke up after only a few months.\n\n\n\nCalf Mountain: Calf Mtn is a small peak in the very southern reaches of Shenandoah National Park. One of my fraternity brothers, Rick, had a piece of mountain property on the lower slopes and I went there one time with Rick and some others, hiking on LSD. I was wearing a pair of leather Dr. Scholl’s sandals that day. When the weather turned a little chilly, I stuffed pine needles in the sandals to keep my feet warm. I meandered all the way to the summit where I witnessed a mind-blowing sunset as voices wafted up from below, “Evan… Ehhhh-van!” I caught up with my pals, no harm done. Musically, this represents a unique tuning that I had invented on my own. I dropped the fat E string down to D and raised the B string a half-step to an A. I used this same tuning on the song “Opium Dream”.\n\n\n\nNobody But You: I don’t remember this song at all, but I find that I like the jazzy chord progression. The references to a bird singing her song and “Rockin’ Robin in the treetop” expressed my joy in rediscovering my sex-life with the woman who later became my wife. This song has what I think is the best lead guitar work on the album. It’s a very Byrdsian chiming-guitar kind of thing.\n\n\n\nRobin’s Run: another one that I don’t recall, an instrumental titled in honor of the woman who later became my wife. Perhaps it should be mentioned that it took many years for Robin to grow accustomed to the idea of Walls Of Genius and its persistent existence. She was a so-called “normal” when it came to all this underground and experimental music activity. She recalls attending a Miracle session and although she clearly admired Leo Goya’s inimitable and forceful creativity, she was rather baffled by the experience of free jazz and noise music.\n\n\n\nRivanna Blues: yet another that I don’t recall, but again, I like the jazzy chord progression, one of my favorites on this album. This tune must have dated to time spent in Charlottesville, after graduating from University of Virginia in 1978. The Rivanna is a river there and I had discovered a great place to hang out (and smoke weed) at the conjunction of the Rivanna and Moorman’s Rivers. We called this place “The Rock”.\n\n\n\nA Refrigerator For Emily: this is a complicated tune that I had written years earlier in college, but never found satisfactory lyrics. In retrospect, I think it could have been arranged better. I think that my attempt to add lead guitar was a mistake, highlights the limitations of my chops at the time and distracts from the beauty of the chord progression. I think it would have been better as a very simple acoustic guitar piece. Lyric-wise, I had tried to write about a girl’s desire for middle-class materialism. “Emily” was a girl I had met at the fraternity house and once made-out with on a couch. When I was casting about, fishing essentially, for some plan of action in my life, I had fantasized that I could get her to go with me on an adventure of some kind. I made a half-hearted effort to court this girl, but realized she already had a boy-friend and a life in motion where she lived in the Shenandoah Valley. At the time, moving to Boston was something I had been entertaining, but eventually I moved to Colorado. Joining me on that Colorado adventure was the soon-to-be ‘Little Fyodor’. Anyway, lyrics or no lyrics, the title stuck.\n\n\n\nShe’s So Pretty, But She Is Insane: I don’t remember anything at all about this song. It must have been about a girl I knew, but I’ll be a monkey’s uncle if I can remember exactly who. It’s possible that this title refers to a girl with whom I worked, Maureen. She was the boss’s daughter, it was my first job in Colorado, and she worked hard on seducing me but when it came to actually consummating the seduction, she demurred, leaving me with a terrible case of the blue-balls. The bad blood contributed to my getting fired from the job, thus leaving me twice screwed without ever having gotten screwed once (so to speak). I don’t know that I would characterize this girl as “insane”, but she was indeed both gorgeous and somehow troubled. This experience pre-dated the first rumblings of Walls Of Genius.\n\n\n\nOpium Dream: this song utilizes the same invented tuning that I used on “Calf Mountain”. These were the only 2 songs I ever used that tuning on. I eventually gave up the tuning because tuning a string “up” only hastened its demise. It was also a hassle in an era when your only reference for tuning a guitar was an A-440 tuning fork. Lord knows how people like Joni Mitchell, the Rolling Stones and CSN&Y could keep their guitars tuned with all the weird open tunings they employed. Most of us had no idea at the time that these people even used weird open tunings, so it was almost impossible to play their songs out of 70s piano-music song books. I still have those books but they’re mostly worthless crap. Standard tuning only went so far with that stuff. Why I called this song “Opium Dream”, I have no idea. I had only smoked opium one or two times and was not impressed.",

I did my best, but my “edits” are a little questionable in places. Often songs flowed almost immediately into the next with a only a split second in-between. I was able to magnify the waveforms on my computer screen in Audacity, and I tried my best to place the track marker in a reasonable/logical place. But it’s not perfect. I guess you can think of this version as a convenience version, in case you ever need to access a specific song easily.\n\n\n\nThe other version of the cassette included here is a straight transcription of the complete sides of the tape.

Sanders\n\n\n\nThis digital archival issue is authorized by Burden Of Friendship.\n\nDigitized by Hal McGee from his personal copy of the cassette, January 2016.\n\n\n\n The first noise ensemble in Chicago was probably Burden of Friendship, in the early to mid-eighties. Burden of Friendship would perform at Unarco, an old abandoned steel factory in Evanston, where there were, according to front man Scott Marshall, “enormous decrepit steel tanks [and] all kinds of lengths of pipe” that made the entire factory seem like “one giant instrument.” The ensemble would bleed from huge gashes in the middle of some shows. One time they smashed lit fluorescent light bulbs across Marshall’s back, which makes a fantastic fifties UFO sound, by the way.\n\n\n\n Burden of Friendship threw all-night noise parties called Voidwatches at the radio stations they worked at—mostly WZRD, out of Northeastern Illinois University, but also at Northwestern University’s WNUR. They used live fireworks, knocked over file cabinets and made, as Marshall describes it, “other general destruction (busted linoleum flooring, holes in the ceiling).” The radio waves carried the sounds of these nights of mayhem, of a dozen drug-addled miscreants alternating between making noise and manning a soundboard.\n\n\n\n Members of the group, many of them DJs at WZRD, included Bill Meehan of Research Defense Squad, Doug Brown (the late “Little Dougie”), Robert St. Clair, James Koehnline, Paul Rosen and Mark Giangrande. According to member Scott Marshall, these early-eighties Voidwatches inspired a generation of noisers, including Daniel Burke (also a WZRD DJ at one point, and the man behind the legendary Illusion of Safety industrial noise outfit), Michael Krause (who later became a longtime DJ at WZRD and also plays under “Death Factory”) and former Sonic Youth member Jim O’Rourke, who has produced records by artists including U.S. Maple, Faust, The Red Krayola and Wilco.\n\n\n\nextract from\n\n“Escape from Noise: Is This Not Music?”\n\nby Arvo Zylo\n\nNewcity Music, April 2012",

It also has a Raincoats and Lemon Kittens vibe. \n\n\n\nFor more information on Bright Too Late, including videos, visit  \n\nwww.haltapes.com/bright-too-late.html \n\n\n\n This archival issue of a collection of stiff kittens has been authorized by David Mattingly of Bright Too Late.\n\n\n\nside a:\n\nagitation (entrance)\n\nclique trip\n\ninterference\n\nthe meaning of meaning\n\ninside the surface\n\nto the edge and then what?\n\nfatigue\n\nwindowsill deceit\n\nmaking politics personal\n\nbeing frippish\n\n\n\nside b:\n\nautumn rhythm\n\nend of an ear (part II)\n\nsix till twelve\n\nafter awhile\n\nhimalaya\n\nnearly twelve\n\nagitation (exit)\n\n\n\nbright too late is\n\ndavid mattingly - guitar, keyboards, voice, percussion, artwork\n\nrick karcasheff - drums, keyboards, voice, found sounds, editing\n\n\n\nwith\n\njane anfinson - violin\n\nerik baade - keyboards\n\nmatt speake - guitar\n\ngary myers - percussion\n\nsteve baynes - keyboards, introduction\n\nbill bowman - bass\n\ntim mcshay - guitar\n\n\n\n-----\n\n\n\nrecorded in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1984\n\n\n\nthanks to David Mattingly for lending his personal copy of the tape\n\nthanks to Little Fyodor for lending his copy\n\nincluded in the download:\n\n- additional pic of the cover of the cassette, from the personal collection of Little Fyodor (Denver, Colorado)\n\n- brief listening notes found inside Little Fyodor's copy\n\n- original liner notes on red sheet of paper are from Little Fyodor's copy\n\n\n\nnew digital transfer by Hal McGee, April 2015: \n\n\n\nThe first version of A Collection Of Stiff Kittens presented here is the tape broken up into individual tracks for each song. I did my best, but my “edits” are a little questionable in places. Often songs flowed almost immediately into the next with a only a split second in-between. I was able to magnify the waveforms on my computer screen in Audacity, and I tried my best to place the track marker in a reasonable/logical place. But it’s not perfect. I guess you can think of this version as a convenience version, in case you ever need to access a specific song easily. \n\n\n\nThe other version of the cassette included here is a straight transcription of the complete sides of the tape. In many ways this version is preferable because it preserves the natural, organic flow of the original cassette album.",

Having said that, these samples sound damn good!",

      "about": "una produccion ECDM 'electro computer domestic music'\n\neditada y distribuida por IEP: c/o Luis F. Mesa, Madrid, Spain\n\nECDM Andújar, Jaén, Spain\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nSeptember 1, 2013 - Rafael Flores wrote:\n\nThis tape was recorded in 1986 using only a computer Sinclair ZX Spectrum 128K. and a shortwave receiver radio.\n\nNote to readers in Spanish: the titles of the cover of the tape were written at the time in a typewriter without accents, sorry for that.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n\nAs so often happens when I have digitized cassette releases of experimental and electronic music from the 1980s and 1990s, I sometimes found it difficult to figure out where to place track markers. Composing and mastering for cassette was much different than that done in the digital age. Often artists intended one track to flow conceptually and continuously into another with no clear division(s). I have done my best to guess where Rafael Flores intended each track to begin and end, and if I have erred I hope that listeners will forgive me.\n\n\n\nTo compensate for this uncertainty I have included audio files of straight transcriptions of the two sides of the cassette. It is my feeling that cassettes were meant to be experienced as two continuous sides of sound.\n\n\n\n- Hal McGee",

Having said that, these samples sound damn good!",

      "about": "World Without Corners by Schlafengarten was originally released on cassette on the Cause And Effect label, Indianapolis, Indiana in 1985.\n\n\n\nThis is how I described World Without Corners in the Cause And Effect November 1985 Cassette Catalog:\n\nSchlafengarten has released four fine cassettes, has recorded extensively with the Psyclones and appeared on a great number of compilations over the past 2-3 years and yet in some ways remains an obscure, enigmatic and iconoclastic figure. WORLD WITHOUT CORNERS is Schlaf's great new collection of pieces--melodious, upbeat, whimsical, dark, brooding, disjointed mutant jazz industrial rock. Unique packaging. This carries our personal recommendation.\n\n\n\nThe cassette came packaged in a standard case with a j-card printed on textured blue paper, plus a small booklet containing artwork that was printed on beige/vanilla colored paper. Scans of the booklet are included in a download of this album.\n\n\n\nAll of the other cassette albums that I have published at Cassette Art Classics have been transcribed from copies of the tapes that the artists sent to me. I have transcribed World Without Corners directly from the original master cassette tape that Michael Karo provided to us for duplicating copies. He mastered the tape on a TDK SA-60 High Bias cassette. I did not use Dolby Noise Reduction for playback of the master, and use of NR is not indicated on the master tape or elsewhere that I can see.\n\n\n\nI had no difficulty dividing up the first side of the cassette into its four songs/pieces. On the second side however, there is no clearly evident place to split the two tracks. So, for now, I am offering Side B of the cassette as one continuous 15 minute track. As a bonus, I am offering Side A in continuous fashion as well.\n\n\n\nHere is a rare treat. It sounds great. The master tape seemingly shows no signs of deterioration of degradation of sound quality. You can experience a cassette release loaded with the sounds of classic 1980s drum machine, analog synths, and other keyboards, as well as found sounds and extractions from mass media.\n\n\n\nI am offering this album for download at Name Your Price with a $2 minimum. Your purchase of a download of $2 or more (if you feel so inclined) will be considered a generous donation which will enable me to continue to offer rare classics of cassette art. All money collected from downloads will be used to pay my Bandcamp and PayPal fees; and if enough generous donations are received the money will be shared with the artist.\n\n\n\nFor those of you who prefer your music on physical media I can make World Without Corners available on CDR (now) and on cassette (in the future). Contact me at haltapes at gmail dot com for details.",

Their side of the tape is gnarly lo-fi improv jazz rock, and while they recorded at least one other release, this is the outfit in their short lived prime. The most known piece on my / EHI's side of the tape is \"While The Boy Slept\" which take's Charles Bukowski's poem \"Death of an Idiot\" and adds music and tape manipulations to the already disturbing piece. The piece \"The Four Stages of Sleep\" shows my interests in what I would call building pieces which add more and more layers to the mix until it barely resembles the way it started. This tape also shows my early interests in tape manipulation in which I would slow down and speed up pieces by pushing the buttons on my old trustworthy Casio Karaoke Machine (I still have it). \"Sudden Presence\" is just strange, and sounds a bit like some of The Earwigs material with the presence of the Casio Rapman keyboard. \"Rain Dance\" is an early solo piece from the 360 Sound sessions that I didn't feel received a fair hearing at the time.",

I actually began working on what I hoped would be a more industrial grindcore kind of sound (ala Godflesh), but with my ears full of early Industrial releases like Cabaret Voltaire's Johnny YesNo soundtrack things quickly changed direction (and trust me this was for the best). The first couple of EHI tapes are kind of unique as I was really coming up with sounds without much influence from the soon to take over my life home recording tape trading scene. That would start changing right after the release of this tape. Overall this tape still holds up as a good listen, way too much Casio keyboard perhaps, but with a total of 20 tracks over 60 minutes this still strikes me as enjoyable. Recorded on a dual cassette Casio Song Star Karaoke machine.",

      "about": "Minóy\n\nDevil Music\n\nMinóy Live\n\n\n\nSide One:\n\nA. The Flavor Of Acid On Ice (a dance in the manner of Japanese Butoh)\n\nB. Me And My Shadow\n\n\n\nSide Two:\n\nPhil Runs The Voodoo Down\n\n\n\nLive in Performance\n\nRecorded on cassette, January 27, 1988\n\nat the Pub\n\nSan Bernardino, California\n\nSpecial Guest Artist: PBK\n\nC-60, Dolby B Noise Reduction\n\nCopyright 1988 Minóy\n\noriginally released on cassette on the Nihilistic Recordings label, Holland\n\noperated by Peter Zincken\n\n\n\nPhillip B. Klingler (PBK) describes the performance:\n\n\n\nActually the first concert I ever performed turned into a controversy. It was in January 1988, a live collaboration with obscure experimental artist, Minóy. It was one of the few concerts he had ever done, he may have performed in L.A. a time or two and on Das' radio program in Santa Cruz at one point or another. With his fragile personality complex (he suffered from anxiety and also depression) it took some cajoling just to get Minóy to perform a concert at all, and I (mistakenly) assured him that our music would go over well on the university campus.\n\n\n\nWe performed the concert in the Student Pub at Cal State University, San Bernardino. We were determined to perform improvisationally, but had a loosely defined strategy in place. Minóy brought an amp, guitar and microphone. I had my own amp, analog synths, shortwave radio, different effects pedals and a TV tuned to static. We agreed that for the first composition I would create a drone that would rise in volume for approximately 15 minutes and he would do some of his trademark wailing vocals on top of that. So, we began, I was using the shortwave radio and a couple of my analog synths running through the old Echo-Plus pedals. Minóy had a colorful cloth that he had draped over his head and shoulders, his nails were painted black, you couldn't see his face at all, he was doing a sort of Butoh-inspired strange, slow dance, while howling some anguished mashup of \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" and, ironically, \"I Get By (With A Little Help From My Friends\").\n\n\n\nWell, about 10 minutes into the performance, the volume abruptly went off, and it was clear the sound man had pulled the plug on the pub's sound system. Minóy sort of sat down onstage and put his hands to his head and I ran off the stage to see what the hell was happening!? The pub manager tells me that customers in the pub were complaining and they had to turn us off because of it. But it soon came out that a group of Campus Crusaders, of which the manager was one, actually felt we were performing a satanic ritual! I went back onstage and told Minóy about the ludicrous reason we were being shut down. We both had our own amps, and in an obvious act of defiance we cranked the amps up and continued playing, Minóy making really obscene noises and racket on his guitar and i was, I think, playing a Moog, and we did this until the campus security came, shut us down and escorted us off the campus.\n\n\n\nHere are some excerpts from the college newspaper, \"The Chronicle\", that reported on this February 3, 1988 (note the discrepancy in the official story re. the manager \"asking\" us to stop first):\n\n\n\n\"Controversial Music Turned-Off In Pub\"\n\n\n\n\"Last Wednesday in the Pub, student union night manager, Mark Hoeg, interrupted Minóy during their music set for the evening, and asked them to stop playing. When they didn't he unplugged their sound system. Hoeg felt he did what he was supposed to according to his job description. 'I had been asked by several people to get them out of the pub. People were getting upset and I was afraid something would happen', he said.\n\n\n\nSome students claimed this was a form of censorship while others felt Hoeg did the right thing because the majority of the audience wasn't enjoying the music. After a heated discussion between Hoeg and the two member group, campus security was called.\n\n\n\n(A) Pub employee... felt they should have been turned off... 'No, I don't agree with censorship, but what Mark did wasn't a form of censorship. The audience reaction was bad', he said, 'They (the audience) wanted him to do it. I can relate to art, but not to this, there is no relationship to art in their music, it's intimidating.'\n\n\n\nPhillip, who performs with Minóy, (said) 'Our music is harsh, we're different, but we don't intend to it to be associated with satanism... as some of the students feel it is.'\n\n\n\nLetters to the editor followed. Here are a couple of quotes:\n\n\n\n\"The cup of hypocrisy runneth over. First, we have Jello Biafra claiming to be a crusader against \"censorship in the music industry\", now we have Minóy complaining they can't hold satanic rituals in public.\"\n\n\n\n\"What transpired at the pub show Wednesday night proved that the local Aryan frat yuppies have little use for anything which doesn't resemble the skinny-tie wimpola pop bands they're used to. The student union manager, goaded by disgruntled patrons, showed his true colors as a power crazed jackal and literally pulled the plug (or had it done) IN THE MIDDLE OF MINOY'S PERFORMANCE! he then hid from criticism behind the campus police. While the music was certainly cacophonous, hardly 'danceable', and perhaps a little self-indulgent, it wasn't any louder than (any of the) other campus favorites that have played the pub in the past. And it certainly wasn't devil music as one deranged young man suggested. In short, the manager's actions constitute nothing less than de facto censorship of the same type Jello Biafra warned students about when he spoke here.\"\n\n\n\nMinóy, Stanley Keith Bowsza 1951-2010",
