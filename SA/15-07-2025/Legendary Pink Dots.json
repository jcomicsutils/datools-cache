      "about": "This is a release for die-hards only. It’s the sound of Edward Ka-Spel lost in the Zone with synthesisers and effects units back in 1981, later developed a little ,but never heard by the wider World in it’s entirety until a few years ago. There have been snatches revealed, on “Kleine Krieg” in particular but the full-on Kosmisch Attack was perhaps considered too indulgent for public consumption during the previous 36 years.\n\nEven so, the session had a tantalising history. It was largely created in Conrad Schnitzler’s mighty music room in Berlin. EK stayed with him in 1981, ostensibly to make an interview for a fanzine (which sadly never appeared ), and the great pioneer kindly gave him shelter for almost a week.\n\nOne night Conrad had a dinner appointment and invited The Pink Dots' singer to “do whatever he wanted “ on the synths and echo chambers scattered around the magical space.\n\nIt was the equivalent of 15 Christmases arriving at once. He indulged himself and recorded the results for posterity. Bless you Conrad…we all miss you!\n\nNovember 15 2018…After several requests, the \"B\" side of the cassette edition was added to the original release. \"An Amsterdam Space Jam\" was created a little later in the 80s and is culled from several hours of improvisation on the Yamaha CS30 synthesiser which EK still owns and loves.\n\nAlas, the Cassette edition is long gone, and a very limited CD-R edition is in the works as this missive is being typed.",

      "about": "Seismically Remastered in 2024, \"Textures\" first appeared as a 10\" vinyl record on the curiously monikered German \"Bog\" label. It was extended for the \"Das Digital Vertrauen\" -a double cd compilation on Soleilmoon, then much bonus material was added for this eventual double cd. Basically a collection of experiments and explorations. It appears here slightly sonically enhanced.\n\nThe bonus disc (Steven Cow etc.) was a 27 minute excursion attached to the initial pressing, but in fact this collection has never been re-pressed so there are no single disc copies. Disc 2 features re-titled re-workings of \"Even Now\" and \"Suicide Pact\" as part of an extended suite.",

      "about": "1993.Picture this. It's a glorious Summer day but EK is inside with only\n\nSabine's dog ,Skoi, to keep him company. An old friend, Sabine, had asked him and Elke to look after her house (and hound) for a week while she went on holiday.\n\nOn this sunny afternoon , EK is strumming an out-of-tune acoustic guitar. Skoi seems to object and HOWLS (a lot). The howls are recorded, as the would-be guitarist runs around the room ,followed by one small dog.\n\nThen it's overdub time....Ballbearings are rolled across the wooden floor .Skoi takes a rest.\n\nThen there's the vocal part...EK seems annoyed by a record  company.In  retrospect, it's a little embarassing (said label really wasn't THAT BAD). However they made it clear that they didn't like LPDs' \"Shadow Weaver\", and childish as it may seem, criticism goes down very badly with the singer .Consquently, the lyrics are painfully vitriolic.\n\n\"Scriptures\" was that kind of album - peculiar, noisy and rather unique but sadly not so well recorded. The Soleilmoon reissue remastered by Raymond put some of this matter to rights, but consider this latest downloadable version to be definitive. EK 2024",

      "about": "Way way back in the early days I used to say a lot about 'The Terminal Kaleidoscope' , a concept comparing the fragile planet we live on to a drowning human being with life flashing before his or her eyes, the images constantly accelerating. It's 2024, a little over 2 decades since the turn of this unbearably turbulent century and the concept appears to have become an unlikely soap opera where we are the cast. Let's hang in there..... EK \n\n\n\nSO LONELY IN HEAVEN - THE CREATION \n\n\n\n'So Lonely in Heaven' is The Legendary Pink Dots' second album since the World stopped for a Global Pandemic. \n\nWith members scattered across three countries and two continents, our guilty confession is that quite a few Air Miles were consumed in its creation.\n\nIdeas were spun across Cyberspace for months, but the magic happened collectively in small spaces with the tape running.\n\n\n\nSO LONELY IN HEAVEN - THE MESSAGE \n\n\n\nThe machine is everything we are. It sees everything, hears everything, knows everything and feeds, speeds, drinks us down, spits us out - we lost control of it at the instant of its conception.\n\nYou may cough, curse and die, but the machine will resurrect you without the flaws, at your peak, smiling from a screen, bidding someone in a lonely room to join you.\n\nIt's an invitation from Heaven, where anyone can be anything they want to be, but it's a Nation of One. \n\nYou'll be everything we are. You'll be a shadow of yourself. You'll repeat yourself- endlessly. You'll be desperate for some kind of explanation .\n\n\n\nYou'll be lonely. So very lonely...",

Ladies and gentlemen , I give you \"Medieval Industrial music\" or how about a small piece for home-made orchestra and drum machine?\n\nNow after remastering the album it feels like one of the best albums The Dots ever made.I confess it had been slowly growing. \n\nIt was our first album under contract for the Play it Again Sam label and were they ever nervous when we delivered the master...\n\nThey shouldn't have been, this one stands the test of time...at least for me.\n\nEK",

Ryan left after this album to focus on his excellent Twilight Circus Project while Frank Verschuuren departed for a career in the New World .\n\nThe final gasp of the Dots' \"big\" line-up lacks consistency .Some fine tracks that stand the test of time, but some regrets about not capturing the enormity of \"Pain Bubbles \" in the studio environment.Likewise \"Lent\" often sounded better live....but\n\nperhaps that's inevitable. The extended LPDs line-up somehow delivered their best work on stage at this time.\n\nWorth a listen is Premonition 25- in my humble opinion the best of this long running saga of dark epics.EK\n\n\n\nArtwork here is from the hyper-limited vinyl version released by Beta-Lactam Ring Records.Nienke Poiesz is the creator.",

      "about": "COME OUT FROM THE SHADOWS PART 4\n\nLounge Ax ,Chicago 1993\n\n\n\nThis is the third and final instalment from The Silverman’s cassette archive which had been gathering dust in a dark cupboard- and it’s a special one, especially for those who hold the \"Shadow Weaver\" and \"Malachai\" albums close to their hearts.\n\nIt’s hard to downplay the importance of the show presented here.\n\nFour years earlier, in 1989, The Dots anxiously anticipated their first show in Chicago (a city they viewed as one of the music capitals of The World) only for the date to vanish without explanation. In 1991, they were due to play third on the bill to Einsturzende Neubauten and old friends, Front Line Assembly at The  Vic.In  a chaotic scenario The Dots played filling in the sandwich between the 2 more famous bands, allowed a mere 15 minutes. It was a fiery show but most of the audience didn’t know who we were, as The Dots’ name was missing from the poster. Consequently this show at Lounge Ax in 1993 felt like our first “real” show in the city. Can you imagine the horror when EK succumbed to a throat infection in Milwaukee a night earlier? That show ,in front of 30 people ,was curtailed after 30  minutes.It  was thanks to Nicoletta Stephanz and her box of medical wonders that the singer found his voice 24 hours later- and we have her to thank for this storming recording. Enjoy.",

Philippe added the final touches ,leaving the inevitable question…\n\nPlanet Earth- are you receiving us?It’s been a while…..Planet Earth, are you, in fact, STILL THERE???",

Ironically, the irreverent pop song “ Curious Guy” emerged from the same sessions. Remastered in 2020 by Ray Steeg and Peter Van Vliet.",

      "about": "The DAT tape was unmarked, the DAT recorder/player had been repaired and treasure was hiding between the ones and zeroes. In fact, more than an hour of unreleased/ unheard sessions for \"Four Days\" emerged which has been edited for this special expanded edition of the 1994 album. Consider this one as the final word on this release.\n\nAgain, here is the story of \"Four Days\".\n\n1990. Summer. Both EK and The Silverman were hopelessly addicted to vinyl but didn't have the money to feed their habit. A little bird whispered to Phil that another collector in the North of Holland had the 3 (Lard free) albums he desired the most AND the aforesaid had just discovered the Pink Dots. It was true , but Henk - the owner of those 3 elusive discs already had already amassed a huge collection of Dots' titles. \n\nConsequently we agreed to make a cassette release just for Henk (who is still a dear friend). Yup an edition of just 1, with Edward's partner at the time, Elke, making the  cover.It  took four days. \n\nHowever Henk insisted the world should hear it, so another 99 cassettes were made. later it was 3,000 cds on The Dots' own TEKA label, and then a Polish re-release.Home-made in every way , but with loving care.",

      "about": "ONLY DREAMING. The first salvo of The Legendary Pink Dots is 42 years old. I guess I’d kept it consigned to history because of it’s primitive nature but a lot of people have been asking so……\n\nHere’s a track by track reflection for the curious..\n\n\n\nSOMA BATH dates back to the early 70s when it was part of  a unfinished concept album from EK's teenage band Vizzyen Laedyr.\n\nIt reflects a bit of an unhealthy Messiah fixation and chronologically was intended to precede ‘Stoned Obituary’ which was also written back then but never recorded until a prototype version by The Pink Dots in 1980.\n\n\n\nBEFORE THE END\n\nWe grew up under the shadow of a mushroom cloud and if anyone ever tells you how great it was in the 70s , then remind them of this. It was terrifying, That’s why so many of us were petrified when Nostradamus was all the rage for a while.\n\n\n\n‘IT ROTS YOUR LIVER\n\n Indeed it does and it's best avoided.\n\n\n\nBLACK HIGHWAY\n\nThe lyrics of ‘Black Highway’ were written after a hair-raising drive through the former Yugoslavia where two columns of trucks could be observed overtaking two columns of trucks on a two lane highway. The results could often be seen rusting on the rocks below. Phil handled the Yamaha CS30 like a champion (no presets!)\n\n\n\nPHALLUS DEI also dated back to that obscure concept album from EK’s teenage band. April’s tune !\n\n\n\nWAITING FOR THE CALL/YOU’N’ME\n\n A bit of a lost version as better recordings exist of this composition from Mick and April elsewhere. Lyrics made in Dagenham.\n\n\n\nDEFEATED\n\nThe first solo song by EK after a dream. It lingered as he woke up and recorded it . Primitive as Hell but it had a future.\n\n\n\nGAME. An EK solo improvisation.\n\n\n\nGUESS THE POLITICIAN\n\n This is what can be written in a dysfunctional country in the dark 1980s . Little has improved.\n\n\n\nANOTHER KIND OF VIOLENCE\n\nThe original title was ‘Dagger Rhyme’.The characters are unnamed in order to dodge the wrath of the guilty.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY NIGHT FEVER\n\nA dark song about a dubious character who clearly needed to go out more.  \n\n\n\nO(RI)FFICE\n\n\n\nBank Manager to EK\n\nHow are things going for you?\n\n\n\nEK to Bank Manager:\n\nI’m not so fond of the filing but a job is a job..\n\n\n\nBank Manager to EK:\n\nNow I’ll tell you what I think of you.You remind me of my son - he’s bone idle you know - and what’s that blue thing you’re wearing?\n\n\n\nEK to Bank Manager:\n\nUmm…a suit.\n\n\n\nBank Manager to EK:\n\nFrankly I don’t care what you want to call it. Tomorrow you will dress casually because I want you to clean out the safe.\n\n\n\nAnd indeed a day later EK  dressed casually in terminally ripped jeans and a Nektar T-shirt with a fly on the front. These were the days when a job at the bank was a job for life. EK lasted for 4 months.\n\n\n\nTHE CHEMICAL PLAYSCHOOL\n\nAn extract of a session that is now a saga.\n\n\n\nVOICES\n\nThe lyrics date back to the start of the 70s when Vizzyen Laedyr  recorded their own take of ‘Voices. Even so, April’s beautiful composition brought this one to life. Maybe this version is primitive but, for me, it the best one. Crisp packets were rubbed for the fire at the end. Burn the Heretic. Stake.\n\n\n\nFROSTY\n\nA famous song for The Dots yet it was never played live. Listen closely , that’s Mick’s laugh at the very start.\n\n\n\nBREAK DAY\n\nThatcher’s Britain was a dark place. Rent-a-thugs stalked the streets of the city, smashed up shows by any band they thought leaned to the left, hunted the deviants just because they enjoyed it. The physical scars are gone, but the mental scars are for life.Boys will be boys eh?\n\n\n\nONLY DREAMING\n\nThe creatures from the Chemical Playschool have escaped from their test tubes.",

      "about": "The Silverman's flat was not the biggest...Often he would dash up into the sanctuary of his tiny attic bedroom (in fact a small square room at the top of the stairs) just to escape the throng milling around below. When the biggest part of Chemical Playschool 3/4 was recorded, that restless throng would be juxtaposing for a handy inch or two as the music room was filled with percussion (courtesy of long term Dots' friend Clive) and a harmonium dating back to Victorian times.\n\nPhil would be playing that beautiful old instrument while EK, Barry , April and Roland would be tapping, bashing and shaking ....often for hours. That ritualistic passage that makes up most of \"Premonition 10\" is but a fragment....CP 3/4 came out in 1983 and at the time was meant to represent everything The Dots were. Certainly it was the finest of all the cassette albums.\n\nThe decision was to make 83 of the the double cassette all housed in handmade collaged covers. Everybody joined in with the cutting, pasting, writing credits with felt-tip  pens.It  was a noble , if exhausting , exercise. Ultimately that first edition ran to 120 , all sold at the price it cost to make them. Some now sadly live in Ebayland.\n\nSince then there have been further editions, all small runs, and even the abridged double cd edition was cursed as the label went bust shortly after it appeared and then disappeared. It remains a proud chapter in Dots history and this (admittedly flawed ) remaster took the best part of a year to put together.Perfecting the imperfect retaining all those imperfections..",

      "about": "“A cubicle for you, a cubicle for me….but not together…”\n\nThe Year 2020 was not a year for a band to 'get things together in the country', or gather in a room to write songs. This statement certainly applied to the Legendary Pink Dots with two members in The Netherlands and one in the UK.\n\nThe pandemic reared its ugly head as the Dots’ criss-crossed Europe on the second stage of their 40th Anniversary Tour. \n\nJust a few days before much of Italy locked down the band was in Milan. A few days later, the destination was Cologne where they opted for a hotel in the countryside…it turned out that the resting place was one village away from the most lethal outbreak of the virus in Germany.\n\nThe tour eventually finished in a sold-out club with a worryingly low ceiling in London. There were hugs, a real feeling of togetherness with a truly lovely audience.\n\nThen the World stopped.\n\nIt was the last time The Dots were in the same room.\n\nSong writing and recording were necessarily deemed to happen in cyberspace for the rest of 2020 and 2021.\n\nAs a result, the lyrics are utterly poignant, desperate, yet sometimes bearing a flash of gallows humour. The soundtrack is a purging fire. It’s a fire that still burns, and as I type this I can say I have never been so excited about the impending release of a new Dots’ album.\n\nNever mind the distance, there is a single-mindedness about “The Museum Of Human Happiness.” It’s 2022. We’ll meet again….EK",

I had no idea when a veneer of normality would be there again back in 2020 when COVID claimed so many. The only way to deal with it was to create as if every day would potentially be the last. “Permission To Leave the Temple “ and “ The Deep” were among the first recordings made during that initial lockdown and it now feels like a good moment to open them up to a wider public, at least temporarily.

      "about": "You always remember exactly where you were when a World changing event occurs.\n\nSeptember 11, 2001. I felt good after writing and recording a song entitled “The Warden” and decided to treat myself to a small break by listening to the news on the radio. I tuned in as the second plane crashed into the twin towers in far-off New York....\n\nThe next song I wrote was “12th\",, a day later. It was an attempt to bring some kind of calm to a growing unease inside me that maybe we were all about to be witnesses to the end of the World. \n\nIn the rarefied World of the Pink Dots, an urgency took hold which resulted in the the twin albums, “All The King’s Horses” and “All The King’s Men” in 2002. Both are heavily featured in the collection presented here and, for me, represent our finest hours in a turbulent decade for the band.\n\nMatters reached a head in 2009 when half of the band quit to pursue their own projects, but happily The Legendary Pink Dots is an enduring institution. If the planet can withstand a trauma like 9/ 11, then a small band of troubadours can battle through  a few sad line-up changes.\n\n“A String of Zeroes “ is the second of four volumes representing decades of The Dots. This one is dedicated to dear friends who played their parts and moved on to pastures anew. \n\n \n\nHats off to Niels, Ryan, Martyn and Frank.",

Times were hard , the house was tiny, the Ka-Spellian studio had shrunk to a \n\nwhat could be fitted onto a tiny table on a platform where the stairs turned.Normally a session meant wearing a coat as heating wasn't so effective but still cost a fortune.\n\nDespite all that \"The Blue Room\"still feels like a fresh album.Initially meant as part of a trilogy of colours ,but the 3rd part was never finished.\n\nIncluded in this Redux edition is a previously unheard piece \"Wounded Knee\" which is from the time.",

      "about": "1980. I was living in a flat over a small grocery shop on the major artery which connected London with the East coast. Whenever a large truck thundered past, the whole building would shake as if an earthquake was occurring. It seemed like these tremors occurred around every five minutes, although it was worse at night.\n\nAfter a visit to the Stonehenge Free Festival I had invested in a Korg MS20 synthesiser, a drum machine with 12 rhythms to choose from which could be speeded up or slowed down with the turn of a pot, a small guitar amplifier and a very cheap microphone.\n\nAt the festival I’d witnessed a band at 3am utilising a shrieking synthesiser and a drum machine and I was extremely impressed. Fellow travellers April and Phil felt the same way. Although we were all sleeping in separate tents, the din at the end of the field was so striking , we all found ourselves wandering in the deep night to the tiny stage saturated with white pulsing lights. We WERE the audience. Nobody else came to watch and the 3 members of that mysterious band seemed oblivious to the trio of spectators.\n\nWe said nothing to each other as we returned to our respective tents and I’m not alone in wondering if this was a phenomenon known as a “shared dream “. Certainly we all remember the occasion, including the odd fact that the 3 of us never exchanged a single word throughout the whole experience.\n\nStill, this voyage into the Twilight Zone was the trigger for me to try and make music again after a couple of false starts in my school days. Happily April and Phil wanted to join me and Mick swiftly turned the fledgling Dots into a quartet.\n\nThis collection represents a sketch of our first 10 years . Back then, a year felt like a lifetime with so many events and emotions packed into it. I guess that hasn’t changed.\n\nThis collection is lovingly dedicated to the memory of Marylou who was so much a part of those first 10 years.EK",

There were a few diversions, a few questions never answered, and a cloud full of value moments. The latter have been preserved for you here and many will be related live in the forthcoming Legendary Pink Dots’ 40th Anniversary Tour.

Been compressed…\nWhen printed out they look a mess.\nWe can still enjoy the sense….\n\nISLE OF SIGHS\nShe was an island in a wild tempestuous sea.\nUpon that  horizon stood timid little me.\nReeled in by the siren, swinging On a hook.\nI offered no resistance, she took no\nSecond look. She cast me back to Nothingness. To nothingness….\nShe was an island but younger than the rest.\nSo proud but so lonely.So tragically obsessed.\nShe pledged a safe harbour until the end of time.\nFor one that's bright, that matches both her blue all-seeing   eyes…I believed. And yes I tried. Oh how I tried and tried and tried and tried"

On your feet or on your head.Don’t you move til it stops bleeding.Saw the next door neighbour pleading to a general and his girl.\nStill they took him.Still they shook him.Tied his hands and crossed his eyes.\nWiped his record .Kept him shackled far from home.It just ain’t right...\n\nAnd I spy a crooked crack that runs right across the ceiling. Cannot stifle this bad feeling that the house is falling down.\nWish I could roll back the years.All the years that I have wasted. Could have changed my destination to the darker side of town.\nIn the shed or in the cellar, snuff the candle, stash the phone.\nWish I had my old umbrella .Please don’t leave me on my own.\n\nAnd I wish I shared your dream.And I wish I had the power.\nWhen they knock I’ll be a coward who could simply turn you in.\nSo you thought we had a team that could break free from this prison.We could make the right decisions and save our precious skins.\nLet’s gather .Hold a seance, clean the table. Clear our minds.\nFind an answer to the chaos and a pathway through the mines."

The Negativ in Frankfurt was a club that lived down to its name, a partly filled crater at the centre of the city, dripping puerile graffiti, a pre-war P.A. system.

This is an audience recording and, despite the enhancement, is unashamedly rough.

In fact, personal anticipation scuppered that plan and here is the finished article a little ahead of time. Conceived and recorded in a nation (a World?) so tragically divided, it could fall apart, it's hoped that just a few seeds of hope and optimism can be sown over the course of the \n\ntime you'll spend in this peculiar World. The cd is in production right now. An expanded vinyl edition is planned for early 2020. Please note that Track 10 is the exclusive 4th side for the coming vinyl edition",

      "about": "It all began so informally. EK had fixed a few low key solo shows around Europe while old friend Nicoletta Stephanz just happened to be on the same continent and had brought her theramin and box of delights with her. \n\nA collaboration seemed like a first class idea although rehearsals were out of the question.\n\nNicoletta's presence added that extra element of chance - but hell, what a glorious element.\n\nAt one point it seemed like she was playing the air itself with a magic wand. EK and Silverman just stared …open-mouthed…Marvellous! Then there was her voice part …..a massive choir of her voice through a myriad of effects. Swathes of improvisation occurred. \n\nIn fact the concert represented here (at Stuttgart) for this cdr release was one of the first…..this trio went on to tour the US finishing with a bizarre climax in Seattle where the whole audience joined in with the band in a song about a happy doughnut.\n\nThere were other faces onstage too during the U.S leg of the tour in 2003 .Ninah Pixie played a circuit bent flower with the trio in San Francisco while EK's all-time hero Daevid Allen joined the band for the encore section of the same show.\n\nTruly unlikely events and also unforgettable…\n\nA big thank you to Nicoletta , Lisa and Ray.",

We have a limited supply of the cd release at Chez Dots, but it can be ordered directly from the label at  www.klanggalerie.com/gg410",

      "about": "The 1990s was a tumultuous decade. The World order we all thought was set in stone had become an illusion, and economies collapsed, horrendous new wars bubbled up and I just remember this feeling of continuous ominous uncertainty.\n\nThat uncertainty was epitomised by the “Millennium Bug”. The irony was inescapable.The World would not be terminated by an asteroid, an alien invasion or a virus from Hell but by a simple programming oversight in the computers we all relied upon.\n\nI remember waiting with baited breath for planes to drop out of the sky as the clock chimed for the 12th time on the last day of 1999 - I’d had my Nostradamus phase like many others and...... nothing happened! We could all enter the 21st Century content that the World would be a calmer, happier, safer place. Oh joy of joys......\n\nFor The Dots, we began the 90s on a high with “The Crushed Velvet Apocalypse” and “The Maria Dimension” being embraced by a wider audience than we’d enjoyed before, but then we lost a precious friend and musician in Bob Pistoor to lung cancer.\n\nThat uncertainty had become part of our DNA.\n\nWe survived, we toured relentlessly, we recorded relentlessly as if to keep the big bad World away from our bubble .And still there was this nagging feeling that the bubble just might burst at midnight on the final night of the decade. I guess I overlooked the fact that they hit that moment far earlier in Australia and there were no devastating consequences. Even so, I turned into a pumpkin. \n\nThis collection is the third instalment of our “Decades” series and is dedicated with love to Bob.",

These recordings from a park in Rotterdam (Parkzicht) have been floating around the World Wide Web for some time, but never as a complete show. This offering fills in the gaps and completes the puzzle. Tracks 1-3 are taken from the VPRO Radio recording of the show, while the rest was never broadcasted in full. \"They Don't Horses..\" did appear on a compilation cassette many years ago (Recloose Live Series Number 1), but this is almost impossible to find. Sound quality has been worked on extensively - a big thank you to Raymond Steeg who did a great job on cutting out unwanted noises.",

      "about": "Cafe Desmet was a special oasis in hectic Amsterdam enjoyed by The Dots on a number of occasions in the early 2000s. Organised by Marylou, and recorded, then aired by the excellent Human Radio, performances would take place on weekday afternoons before a small but usually informed audience. Sometimes a stranger would drop by as can be just about heard in the fade-out of \"Prisoners Of War\" where an unwary soul concluded that he needed ear protection. This release captures one of these ceremonies ( on 15 July 2006) and is dedicated with love to Marylou.",

Indulgence?? Of course !!...EK",

      "about": "The concept for “Der Aussiedler” (‘The Emigrant’) was hatched by Rene Heid in 1990, who was an old friend of the Pink Dots and locally famous for always having highly desirable vinyl to trade. Rene was also a fashion student and approached The Dots and Nijmegen compatriots, Beequeen, to create some music for a show he was putting on.\n\nThe soundtrack proved to be a success for experimental catwalk in Arnhem and Rene felt that the music deserved a wider audience.\n\nHence he came up with the idea of a vinyl single - as a 7” and a 12” complete with a T-shirt.\n\nThe small edition quickly disappeared but some shirts and 12” vinyls were held back for a special edition 4 years later.\n\nMore music was recorded for this follow-up of 30 copies , reproduced on a cassette and every remaining shirt was personalised with signatures and artistic doodlings which verged from the ridiculous to the abominable. All the music has been cleaned up for your delectation here by Raymond Steeg. Enjoy! EK\n\n\n\nThis album is also available from:  beequeen.bandcamp.com",

      "about": "AAZHYD CHINA DOLL 1987\n\n\n\nSteve Stapleton planted the idea….\"You simply have to make ACID China Doll…\"\n\nLiving in my tiny little room in an Amsterdam squat , living out of the local snack bar on Tuesdays and Thursdays ,living on crumbs of human kindness during the rest of the week, the challenge seemed huge.How to live up to a title like that.\n\nI'd spent the last of my money on an 8-track recorder ,a mixing desk and an Akai sampler.Getting from the door to the bed by the wall involved climbing very carefully. Engineering was done laying down as there was no room for a chair. Still Barry managed to set up his amp and play some inspired guitar parts on what was meant to become the ultimate album in the China Doll series.\n\nIn the end I was proud of the uneven beast that emerged, but not proud enough to call it \"Acid China doll\". Consequently I changed the spelling.\n\nThe record company didn't seem to like it and worse they released it in my absence (I was on tour).One whole channel dropped out on one of the tracks as no-one checked the test pressing.\n\nI broke down in their office ,pleading for a re-press. Somebody suggested that they released records by people like Edward Ka-Spel as an act of \"charity.\"This was a relationship that seemed doomed from that moment although they DID put a lot of things right with a cd reissue a few years later- something I still appreciate.\n\nI love \"Aazhyd China Doll\"…just wish I'd made the record that didn't require a change in the spelling.",

      "about": "“Sorry For Laughing” is the solo project of Gordon Whitlow, who has been part of the Biota collective for four decades. I followed his work since the beginning, so when he approached me to collaborate on a project involving dusty old hammond organs, a wheezy old accordion and various string driven things, I had no hesitation in shouting a loud “YES!!” As the project progressed , the idea arose of inviting Martyn Bates (Eyeless In Gaza) to join, who is another artist I’ve admired on a creative and personal level since the dawn of the Dots.\n\nWhen violinist extraordinaire, Patrick Q.Wright is added to the mix, as well as interjections from Kiyoharu Kuwayama, Janet Feder and Nigel Whitlow, then a thing of serious beauty became inevitable. \n\nThe wonderful Klanggalerie released this small wonder as an immaculately packaged cd over here:  www.klanggalerie.com/gg358  EK",

      "about": "Normally we try to avoid audience recordings as, all too often, those in front of the stage can come across as being louder than the band ON the stage. Back in 1993, at the rather beautiful old Trocadero Theatre, the audience did their best to triumph in the loudness battle so this release is far from being sonically perfect. However, there's a quality to the playing and a certain clarity that earns it a place on this page. It's a transitional set of songs too, featuring a few rarities. Just turn it up and step right inside, but PLEASE ...do be quiet!",

      "about": "1986. I’m on a plane high over the arctic wastes of Greenland en route to Vancouver, Canada.\n\nI’ve been invited to play a three show residency at a small club named “Channel One” and I’m nervous.....\n\n\n\nI’d built up a mental picture of North America from a stream of ‘horror’ news reports, which had left me a little afraid to step out of a car upon arrival. In short, it felt like I was flying into a dangerous landscape of gangs, guns and glittering blades.. no place for a naive boy from Dagenham.\n\nIt was in this mindset that I wrote the lyrics to “Center Bullet”. In the years leading up to this adventure, I’d built up a long distance friendship with cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy and he asked me to write lyrics and add vocals to a long instrumental piece of theirs. Don’t ask me for an explanation of those words...they are pure train of thought, but you could say there’s a lot of blood.\n\nCEvin manned the mixing desk for my shows, and the recording of “Center Bullet” went so well, we decided to keep a good thing going. It’s 2020, and Tear Garden just turned 34!\n\nAs for my American fears, Vancouver was a city where the cars stopped for a pedestrian to cross the street and it seemed like everyone smiled all the time.\n\nI’m sceptical when it comes to news broadcasts in these more informed times.\n\n\n\nThis collection focusses on the 80s recordings, including a few songs from “Eye Spy with My Little Eye”, an album where many of cEvin’s instrumental pieces from that decade were finished by us both 20 years later.",

In reality, these anniversaries tend to pop up as surprise realisations rather than the landmark occasions many would deem them to be.\n\nEven so, we need no excuse to be excessive, so this “40 Year Scratch” was somehow inevitable.\n\nA studio version of “Katrina” was a work in the pipeline for quite some time, while the rest of the material is from sessions on the beautiful island of Hydra, where the taxi is a donkey and the monastery is a mile high. No airport, no cars, an occasional ferry, and two Pink Dots attempting to provide a soundtrack for all that beauty.\n\n\n\n1. KATRINA (2019)\n\n2. THE HYDRA SESSIONS 1- 3",

      "about": "\"To Be An Angel Blind\" is probably the most melancholy offering from The Tear Garden. It all began in a hotel room in Mexico City with Martijn De Kleer and Edward Ka-Spel pulling \"Ascension Day\" out of the ether, and the story continued with daily (lengthy) improvisations in the studio in Vancouver. These workouts would be edited by Anthony Valcic who was a bonafide member of the group for this one. Sweet sorrow, and the title has been corrected for this web release.",

      "about": "\"I knew a Katrina once........\".Intended as a one-off performance for an audience of around 25 in The Dots' home town of Nijmegen, \"Katrina\" became a piece de resistance for EK and The Silverman as they developed and expanded it over the years. However, on show here is that fragile first performance which began with Phil playing a record with a toy van that happened to have a cartridge attached to it's underside and EK bidding the confused viewers to enter a New Orleans strip joint on a cold night in The Netherlands.A magical night with Raymond Dijkstra and Timo Van Luik also on the bill. All 4 musicians improvised together at the end of the evening. \n\nThe second piece ,\"Slogans on a Cold Steel Canvas\" is an abridged improvisation from the sessions that also provided much material for \"Seconds Late for The Brighton Line\". \n\nWhy is this album entitled \"The 30 Year Itch?\"Well, that's how long it took to release a record under THE EK/Silverman banner.\n\n10 years on, the master s have had a small upgrade and, as it's now 40 years, it seemed the perfect moment for a special edition.",

Some first aid was applied here and there, but here it is....The Legendary Pink Dots Live At The Fillmore.",

      "about": "“Revolutions In The Head” represents the almost transcendental result of “Discipline In The Studio” as members of The Big City Orchestra, Legendary Pink Dots And Frans De Waard (Modelbau, Kapotte Muziek and much more) combined to create a stream of 60 minute soundtracks for a TV station in San Francisco .\n\nIf that sounds like a recipe for chaos, then think again. The concentration involved was almost terrifying, but the satisfaction displayed when that clock hit the magical 60 minute mark invariably seemed like a glorious release.\n\nAll the music here was recorded in The Silverman’s Attic studio .\n\nDas And Ninah of Big City Orchestra instigated the project and flew to The Netherlands for these sessions.\n\nThe first hours involved them, The Silverman and Frans while Edward Ka-Spel joined for the last part of the penultimate session and the final hour.\n\nEdward had literally just got off the train from London, before tiptoeing upstairs, unpacking his keyboard and various devices, connecting the wires as soundlessly as possible in order claim his patch in the cauldron. The “Hellos” were delayed as only 30 minutes had passed of the musical voyage which he joined in a seemless fashion.\n\nWhen the music was over, there seemed to be a general consensus that this meeting of minds needed to be heard by a wider audience. A big thank you to Frans for the hours he spent editing to make this release possible.\n\n\n\nYou can also find this release at these sites: \n\nemerge.bandcamp.com/album/revolutions-in-the-head\n\n  kormdigitaal.bandcamp.com/album/revolutions-in-the-head\n\n\n\n Both sites are crammed with excellent music, and we strongly recommend \n\nan exploration.",

      "about": "1987.The Dots were strangely deflated after the completion of their last album ,\"Island of Jewels\",as it just didn't seem to deliver what was promised (although I'd argue that it sounds better as years march on).\n\nThe result was an intense few month where all members created personal demos and at a long (and merry ) meeting the demos were heard and (gulp!) judged!\n\nEverybody wrote something musically for Any Day Now and the result was one of the band's strongest records.\n\nHelping the recordings was the set-up of rented studio equipment at Niels' barn in a remote part of Holland and a truly wonderful month of sunshine. \n\nJason chose to sleep outside in a hammock and still probably carries the scars of a thousand mosquito bites. Hans myre did a fine job in the engineering department.\n\nRaymond's 2012 remaster of \"Any day Now\" is also set for physical release sometime in the future ,but as no date can yet be set, the decision was made to upload the album to Bandcamp.",

      "about": "The concept of Des Astres D’Or Records is a noble one. The label, which is operated by sound artist Raymond Dijkstra, aims to present a vinyl release as the kind of art object you would normally find in a gallery.\n\n\n\nTo this end, the records are literally pressed one by one in the highest quality (not lathe-cut) and every cover is individual, created by the artists themselves.\n\n\n\nIt means pressings are hyper-limited as the time required to prepare a single record can be lengthy. Indeed, all but one of the releases on the label are limited to just 25 copies!\n\n\n\n“10 to the Power of 9 Chapters 3 & 4” was released a few months ago and, alas, sold out on the day of release.\n\n\n\nThe music is a massive expansion of the original “Chapter III” from a couple of years ago, while EK created the covers utilising pens, paint, photos, scissors and digital technology for his first serious excursion into the World of visual art.\n\n\n\nIt has been quietly available on the “low profile” Bandcamp page of Edward Ka-Spel for a few weeks, but it feels like the appropriate moment to show it off to a wider audience.\n\n\n\nThe address for Des Astres D'Or is:  www.des-astres-dor.com",

      "about": "\"Atomic Roses\"appeared on cassette back in 1982 and remains one of the most beautifully packaged releases in LPDs' long history. The artwork was created by members of the wonderful (and still active) French band Deficit Des Annees Anterieurs who were responsible for their own Illusion Productions label. Contact was made by mail , exotic packages were exchanged and when we were invited to submit a release for this label of love, it felt like a dozen Christmases had arrived at the same moment!\n\nAs for the music, much will be familiar through collections like \"Chemical Playschool 1 & 2\" and \"The Legendary Pink Box\" , but there is a thread that runs through this original concept album, and it still sounds strong even after 36 years....EK",

      "about": "It started with a dusty box of DAT tapes. Perhaps it was years since anyone had listened to them despite the tantalising labels,\"Paris #1\", \"Paris #2\",\"Paris #3”... Indeed it was Paris where the Dots played their first residency in 1992. However , these tapes were a document of the Dots' one and only 3-nighter from the 10th to the 12th of March 1994 at the delightful Theatre Passage du Nord Ouest. For this special occasion, HOURS of material were prepared and delivered in the certainty that quite possibly the same 300 or so people would turn up each night. Backing up that theory was the traditional shout of \"champignons\" from a mystery member of the audience on each of those nights. That clarion call actually began in Montreal a few years earlier, and we STILL hear it whenever we play in that city. It was ambitious. Sometimes the band was a little shaky but songs were played that were never heard again on a stage. Even so, some of the best shows happened outside Paris. In Marseilles for instance at Espace Julien a few nights later. A big venue and a surprising large turnout for another French city that The Dots simply fell for. What you hear on this collection is all from that 1994 tour culled from shows in the French capital, Marseilles and Toulouse (alas, nobody remembers the name of that venue). Even so, the Dots' French connection goes back to 1985 when they played in Strasbourg at Le Bandit. After playing in more sedatory venues in The Netherlands and Switzerland, this introduction to a French audience literally stunned every member of the band. Basically the crowd listened in complete silence as the notes were played, and would erupt like Vesuvius at the conclusion of a song. That show lasted for well over 2 hours. We still love France. The landscape, the culture and most of all, the people. We’ll be back.",

      "about": "Can a Human Being fly like a bird? Is that wax and those feathers really necessary?\n\nChemical Playschool 11-13 was about as ambitious as any project ever to have emerged from Chez Dots.The intention was a 3 hour epic psychedelic experience with no breaks resulting in the listener leaving his or her body and flying around a darkened room, connected yet disconnected with the \"real\" world.\n\nOld tapes were trawled for sleeping caterpillars in order for them to be transformed into brightly coloured butterflies; many new pieces were fashioned in order to make the journey natural , yet full of strange surprises.\n\nIt took a year.Every day of a whole year in fact….this creation crept forward bit by bit. In fact it became an obsession.\n\nAt around the 9 month mark , the idea came that the listener should in fact be tied to his or her armchair with the 3 cds lined up in a cd changer.That was when EK opted for once code per cd although there are many catchy songs embedded in this journey.Damn megalomaniac….\n\nWhen CP 11-13 finally emerged in that blue box with the birds ,quite a few people picked it up but few talked about it.A humbling experience, and it took over 10 years for the next volume of CP to appear.\n\nIt' remains a loved release here at Chez Dots..in many ways it's everything The Legendary Pink Dots represent. For these impossibly speedy times it has been broken up ….a little.That's also due to Bandcamp only able to allow uploads of a \n\nmaximum of 600 MBs. \n\nYou are invited.No-one ever promised you an easy ride…\n\n\n\nThis remaster was made by EK during the course of an intense week in January 2013. It remains an obsession.",

      "about": "Always pacing the thin line that divides blissful ascension with a fall from a great height , The Dots' return to Tel Aviv's Barbie Club in 2013 was a nerve-shredding adventure. The Promoter's concept was a reunion of the present line-up with former Pink Dot but ever-present friend .Patrick Q. Wright and the resurrection of a long list of songs from the 80s. We liked the first part of the idea , but Pink Dots' Karaoke rankled more than a bit .Consequently we settled upon just a precious few nuggets from the past.\n\nEven so, the biggest problem was REHEARSAL. Pat lives in Italy, and schedules just wouldn't allow us all to be in the same room before stepping off the plane.\n\nConsequently files flew through cyberspace and practising was a lonesome experience.\n\nWhile there were mistakes (plenty) , the sheer exuberance of the audience carried us through to the point where we agreed to a Promoter on his knees pleading with us to play \"Curious Guy\" as a second encore although we hadn't rehearsed that one AT ALL. \n\nAn exciting little chapter in our bizarre existence and no regrets at all.This release is Stage 2 in our efforts to raise funds for the Dots' Page Aquarian Tour in September / October. A BIG BIG Thank you to Ray Steeg for preparing this much requested master recording.",

      "about": "The history of The Dots must appear like an impossible maze to the uninitiated. Some songs appear on several cassette releases , often re-recorded ,sometimes reinvented for the myriad of compilations the band turned up on. Occasionally a 20 minute LPDs epic would include known songs morphing into atmospherics as with the rare \"The End Of The World As We Know It\". The familiar becomes a little unfamiliar, the memory plays tricks. I blush to confess it was deliberate. Even so, this compilation is doing it's best to play fairer , even if a song like , say ,\"Down From The Country \" can be found elsewhere. For the purist , we're making a pristine new edition of \"Kleine Krieg\" on CDR, while ,for those who (understandably) jump up and down and shout \"I don't need \"Defeated\" yet again\" ,there is also this collection which largely avoids the repetition .Cover art by the Silverman based on a painting by Emma Hyland-Arkley.",

Ostrava is a working town,there are coal mines; it's a World away from Prague .....would anyone there even have heard of the Pink Dots? In fact a few hundred people showed up and ultimately it was one of the most enjoyable shows in our long history - it also probably features our longest ever rendition of \"Citadel\"clocking in at over 11 minutes. Another joyous evening in the Czech Republic- a country we love dearly. \n\nBig thank yous to Adam and Adriana who started things for the Dots in this special corner of the World.",

A walk in the forest with Alena , Phil and Astrid eventually led to a frozen lake.Children were hurling large chunks of wood into the ice and the sound was like a strange cannon fired from the clouds. Inevitably the audio recorder was produced and the sounds were captured and then used as foundations for \"Trapped in Amber\".An aural painting and released only on vinyl by Plinkety Plonk Records.",

      "about": "Basilisk (2013 Remaster)\n\n\n\nMemories flood back when listening again to this cassette album from way way back .Some of the earliest roots of what would become \"curse\" are there; there are remnants of the abandoned \"Stigmata\" project .\n\nThis was intended as a concept album about a sculptor who went mad while trying to sculpt his perfect lover .An arm fell off and he ran riot with his chisel , hacking and destroying everything in sight. The planet fell to pieces, heaven fell to pieces and he was brought before God who bore a plaster over his left eye ,but was sympathetic to those who acted in the name of love. The sculptor's \"punishment?\n\nYou guessed, he had to re-sculpt the universe.\n\nSadly abandoned ,but fragments are plentiful. Then there's Basilisk 2 with those ominous field recordings from Notre dame cathedral in Paris.\n\nBasilisk has it's own flavour, and this remaster admittedly leaves off the bonus tracks which adorned the reissue cd, and hopefully respects the atmosphere of the original. less a remaster , more a clarification.\n\n\n\nOriginal cassette release by Third Mind Records.Reissued on cd by Beta-lactam Ring Records.",

      "about": "1981\n\n\n\nChemical Playschool 1 & 2 dates back to the very beginning of the Legendary Pink Dots.\n\nWhen LPDs decided to make their first tentative wave from the great ocean of artists just wanting to be noticed, they produced 2 cassettes. \"Only Dreaming\" had the songs plus a few mangled interludes; \"Chemical Playschool \" was one long \n\ndisturbing trip clocking in at an hour. Parts of that trip are reproduced on CP 1 & 2\n\n(\"Stars on Sunday\", \"Redeemed\" and others).Also in the pot was a large part of the promotional cassette which EK left in record stores around Europe (\"Primer\"-written in cyrillic script).\n\nIn fact CP 1 & 2 is a compilation of the first year of LPDs.\n\nBeware, much of it appears elsewhere (Legendary Pink Box, Kleine Krieg,Dots on the Eyes,Premonition). It is also not for hi-fi enthusiasts (primitive equipment, the occasional tape \"drop-out\").\n\nThe original run with handmade covers was just 25 copies ,all sent to Eurock in the US .The master tapes were then accidentally erased but cassette copies were found. \n\nThis remaster comes from second generation cassettes found stuffed in a box.The music has been painstakingly enhanced and clarified but sound quality is inevitably flawed.The sonic overhaul is respectful- there was no desire to turn the work into something that it isn't.",

It features LPDs live in Sundsvall in 1989 on Swedish Radio plus a little interview. Quality is high , but be sure the sound of that raging crowd you hear at the beginning was for a different band. The brutal truth is that maybe 30 people saw the show after a spectacular 10 hour drive through Sweden in the middle of Winter.Indeed there were literally walls of snow lining the route. Still it was worth it - the hardy souls who showed up treated us well..",

      "about": "For the serious Dots connoisseur ,we include here The Dots' part in the infamous \"Shed Sounds Sampler\" ,which was a promotional cassette issued by In-Phaze Records back in 1983. Essentially this was a fabulous cut-up of \"Curse\" created by label boss (and engineer extraordinaire) Pat Bermingham. Pat owned an 8-track console (bought from Pink Floyd's Nick Mason) and he was simply a master of the controls.This was incidentally Cevin Key's introduction to the Pink Dots and it intrigued him enough to seek contact with EK- we all know what happened next...\n\nAlso here is the bizarre and epic LPDs' side of \"Tryst 7\" (or at least one of the mixes...I believe there were two).This beast saw a frightening meeting of minds with Big City Orchestra and LPDs creating the' collage to end ALL collages.Every copy of this cassette which emerged was unique, but all spewed out a mountain of chaos on the carpet once the unwary purchaser dared to open that plastic bag.\n\nYes we now live in the digital age...a TIDIER age...but somewhere I miss that sheer chaos..EK",

      "about": "2005. It seems hard to believe that this highly emotional album is almost a decade old upon this day of its digital resurrection.Ostensibly an album of songs ,picking up the thread from \"Red Letters\" which was another decade before. This upload for Bandcamp showcases the ultimate version - a massive 3 x LP set from Beta-Lactam Ring Records. It's tough to score these days , but all the parts are in place right here on this page. Sound enhancement is subtle as Ray's original master sounded so good- it merely takes advantage of the high quality digital tools which are now available.",

      "about": "RED SKY AT NIGHT\n\n\n\nConsider the scenario….A huge spooky house. No phone. No internet. Damn it, no working fridge in the kitchen.\n\nThe last problem isn't as bad as it sounds as the house is in Finland and it's Winter, and there is a dark room where the sun does not shine (ever).That's where the milk, butter, curious Finnish beer (Lapin Kulta) goes.\n\nHalf of the house is shut off, sheets over the furniture. The \"living\" half is quiet apart from the odd creak in the night which could have emerged from any of the 8 or so rooms.\n\nSuch was Alena's living space in the little town of Karis, provided by the college where she worked as a teacher.The previous occupant had been a missionary who disappeared with his family to Kazakhstan years earlier , generously allowing the college to use the house as they wished.\n\nThe nearest supermarket was 40 minutes away in the Summer, but somehow considerably further when the temperature dropped to minus 20 (and it frequently did).\n\nFocal point of the living room was an electric church  organ.It  hadn't been played for years when Alena opened the lid for the first time.\n\nWhen EK entered her life, that instrument was almost permanently switched on.The sound was utterly glorious, much in evidence throughout these recordings and it still turns up in all kinds of places on recent releases from EK/LPDs.\n\n\"Red Sky At Night\" is a collection of improvisations featuring EK and Alena from 2007-2010 largely made in Karis but also derived from sessions in The Netherlands .It's a humble cdr release that has always existed under the radar, but it delivers some truly special moments as well as a whole lotta love.",

Old friend Mick Marshall provided the Yamaha DX9 which was new and utterly fascinating back in 1984; there was a Linn Drum, a Fostex 8-track recorder\n\nand much spontaneity. \n\nPat White came onboard for some scorching guitar, Patrick Q. gathered the violins together and provided a self-made choir for \"Requiem\" (he in fact has a solo recording of this piece with different words- if you ask nicely he may let you hear it!). Another Pat (Bermingham) helped with mixing and rush released it on his InPhaze label while EK was in The Netherlands. A little embarrassingly, the cover was apparently a page ripped from a library book.\n\nThe album came and went....however when a reissue was discussed it seemed that the master tape had also disappeared, or to be more accurate,it had disintegrated in Pat B's garden shed.\n\nThis faithful cd reproduction was remastered by Ray Steeg from the original vinyl and bonus cuts are from \"Dance China Doll\"- the 12\" EP which preceeded it.There are also a couple of bonus pieces from the obscure vinyl second edition of the album (\"Suicide Pact \"live in 1988)\n\nand the long gone \"Perhaps we'll only see a Thin Blue Line\" collection\n\n(\"The Fool with Hammers\").",

Sadly it isn't the whole show (from the Bikini Club in Toulouse, France), and quality is shaky ,especially with those drop-outs here and there, not forgetting a dose of flu for the singer- but enhancement has also brought it to life.\n\nIt's important as it's one of the first shows with Bob Pistoor and reflects just how the Dots transformed during that special year. A document , and some rare live songs too (just a pity the first part of \"Waiting for the Cloud\" is missing).",

      "about": "\"Lyvv China Doll\" started life as an elaborate but very elusive cassette release from The Dots' TEKA label- it was half live material and half comprised of bits and pieces that needed a home.\n\nLater it became a cd for the Staalplaat label and the live side was dropped while more bits and pieces came into view.This remaster brings the two releases together.\n\n The first live piece in the track listing is actually \"The Horn Section\" while a little later the first ever performance of \"So Gallantly Screaming.\" can be heard as a mere idea rather than a finished song. The year was 1985 and the venue was in the village of Delden in the far East of The Netherlands.\n\n Never heard of Delden? Guess what, they hadn't heard of us either (EK, Ignit, Ed van Kaye)..You could say the reaction was minimal when the screaming started; it even became mildly hostile when that horn section (actually miniature plastic saxophones from the gas station) were introduced. I'd like to think they still talk about it in Delden but they probably forgot decades ago.\n\n Other live tracks were from an especially heavy solo show in Vienna (1988) and Strasbourg (1986) where The Silverman and Stret Majest Alarme completed a particularly incendiary line-up.\n\n Other notable songs from Lyvv\" include \"Tower 8\" and \"When Old Gods Die\" (with Patrick Q.Paganini) which were the famous \"missing \" bonus songs from the original \"Chyekk China Doll\" cd. After this mysterious omission, the master tapes were delivered to a guy in Sweden for an intended 7\" release. Sadly tapes and guy disappeared. Thankfully EK had rough cassette copies in his drawer .\n\nFinally I must thank Hero Wouters for his amazing work on \"Dada\" and \"Beautiful Plastic\" (he wrote the music for the latter piece). Always a joy to work with Hero....Thanks too to Bianca Wouters for her voice ...EK",

That's why the music is divided into two parts- the set and the encores.\n\nThis night was shared with Toby Dammitt and das Verkannte Modul.",

VPRO Radio invited the band to create a side of this album in a top studio in Hilversum, The Netherlands while the live side was captured by a state-of-the-art multi-track recorder at The Melkweg in  Amsterdam.At  the end of the year ,EK relocated to The Netherlands to spend as much time with Marylou as he could.\n\nA perfect scenario? Alas, no……A falling out with the Ding Dong label saw \"The Lovers\" released initially without the band's permission. EK fled from the label's hq in Arnhem to spend a few months on a friend's floor in Amsterdam. For a while chaos reigned supreme ,and the album that followed (\"Asylum\") represented a complete departure from the glossy production that can be heard here.",

      "about": "Below is the official press release for an album that crept quietly out earlier this year but seriously deserves attention as it's a bit special...(Thanks to Wesley and Jesse for it's presence on this page).\n\n\n\nFeatures Edward Ka-Spel, Jesse Peper and Wesley Young. Ed. of 500 copies. Deciduous Flux began channeling energies through recordings early 2011 in Denver Colorado. It is the ongoing creative collaboration between Wesleyoung and Jesse Peper. Wesleyoung, a visual artist and also the founder and proprietor of a collective abstract underground sound project known as Behavior. Jesse Peper is primarily a painter, but has also performed and/or recorded with Not Breathing, Waldteufel, Legerdemain and Icedagaz. Deciduous Flux was originally conceived a few years earlier than this as a visual collaboration between both artists which resulted in a series of large paintings. During the Development of these artworks many conversations often led to the discussion on the medium of sound, as both of us have always kept a love for the craft of sound. At this time we have been recording a year and a half resulting in 12 full recording sessions. Much of this material is in production and will be released to the public within the coming months. Our recording process is quite different than the usual conventional approaches on what music is \"seen as\" or \"supposed to be\" to the world. On one hand we are obsessed on the opiates of oblivion and we are recording constantly for no outcome other than for our own meditation purposes, for achieving various states and documenting them through the recording process. This, within itself, is an intoxicating pre-procedural agent for what follows! Largely our aim is to capture these otherworldly trans-dimensional expressions or bleed-throughs with the proper elements to perform the divine inductions, invocations and evocations etc, through the methods of our ritual. The tradition we naturally adopt is more akin to that of the shaman than it is to modern modalities of thinking. We recognize the spirit-forms or energies around us to guide us within appropriate directions according to our will and desire. On another hand, at times we see our process fall into a method which we have described as automatic recordings, similar to some degree in the approach of automatic drawings only using sounds rather than images as the medium with which to explore, amass and create our impressions on the hanging space of time. Within the Deciduous Flux is like a painting with sounds. A rich palette of sound to create and stimulate visions both from externally and internally. Each byproduct of the recordings presents an invocation of elements which create metaphysical vortexes to other dimensions with which the listener can also gain access to if the desire to do so exists.",

Besieged but unflustered. The crumbs of our comfort descend when we call them and take only that which we need, then toss the remains like we're scattering seeds. Where we do not believe because we don't have to. Where we do not believe in the future , the past. Where we are……no questions. We are, and that's it…There's an eternity that clings which we stretch out , fend off and count the terrifying seconds in an everlasting twilight. And there's an eternity with wings. It's short and it's sweet , it laughs at the mirror and always is now. Me? I remain forever\n\nyours.Trapped in Amber.",
