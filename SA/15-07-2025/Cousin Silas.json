The series was started with the idea to collect and gather all the material I'd done for compilations over the years, and it's still going. After 17 Volumes (17 is as yet to be released) I thought it was time to do a kind of 'personal' best of. It features tracks, in order of release, that I am rather fond of. \n\n\n\nThe track number relates to the source volume that the featured track appears on.",

      "about": "It was a few years back that myself and Eisenlager created our first collab album. We always promised ourselves we would do another one, hence the title of the last track from the original release: \"Believe Me, More Is Coming.\". Sadly he passed away before we managed it, but he did send me several pieces to consider. I thought it was time to dust off those pieces, add my bits, and refit some of his solo tracks he sent for the various Emporium Projects. \n\n\n\nI guess this resulting album is both a tribute to the man, and a promise upheld that indeed more did come. \n\n\n\nFor Nobby, a good friend, supporter and above all, the man behind one of the best compilation series, Midnight Radio. It was these that helped me gain a little self confidence back in the day. I miss the guy.",

      "about": "New Runes, re-released with two extra tracks, one refigured by Cousin Silas, and the other by GOB.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes:\n\nLooking at the files for this album, the first sketches appeared around September 2021. That makes it the longest gestation for a collaboration album with Cousin Silas (our sixth, the last in 2020). It’s also the greatest gap in putting out any new ideas since the GoB began.\n\nIn the past I’ve started out with a broadly clear narrative to work around. This didn’t start that way. I just had a circling nucleus of undirected rage that occasionally proposed titles and ideas.\n\n\n\nThe period from March 2020 to September 2021 delivered so much ‘content’ both over the internets and IRL. It was difficult to filter this down to reason. There’s an interview with David Bowie by Jeremy Paxman from 1999 where DB prophesises the impacts both positive & negative of the internet. Look it up (it’s worth noting that the planet has gone to hell since he passed. Studies need to be made).\n\n\n\nIt was perhaps not surprising that a global pandemic delivered the best of humanity on so many levels (charity, reason, science, benevolence, realisation of the value of workers, a tantalising look at how life could be better valued and lived) and also finally unboxed the absolute worst that had for numerous past decades been side-lined by truth & reason.\n\n\n\nPuritanism, righteousness, division, corruption, an imagined ‘culture war’, embedded & extended privilege, a riled & enraged but ill-informed and manipulated electorate, an unimaginably wealthy tiny number of people, all took a deep breath and realised shouting at the marginalised, using punching down rhetoric and waving flags works and might delay their ultimate & deserved extinction.\n\n\n\nWelcome to the New Dark Ages (yes, Pere Ubu got there first but I stand on the shoulders of these giants).\n\n\n\nDedicated to the ‘woke’, the SJWs, the non-conformists, the transgressives, the punks, the anarchists, XTR, the lefties & liberals. Every time these terms are used as slurs it means you’re winning. \n\n\n\nNew Runes is an arthritic index finger raised and ready.\n\n\n\nThank you to those who contributed to this auditory rant.\n\n\n\nG.o.B. // October 2022 \n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally released October 28, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Glove of Bones\n\nConcepts, samples, apps, guitar noises & loops, production / construction / mastering, artwork & video.\n\n\n\n\n\n1: Introrobus\n\nFor the warrior Christopher Eric Hitchens (13 April 1949 – 15 December 2011)\n\n\"What can be asserted without evidence can also be dismissed without evidence\"\n\n\n\n2: The Universal Hum 3:30am\n\nThis track includes a section of dialogue by Anton La Vey and a short section from his musical works.\n\n\n\n3: I laughed at the Great God Pan\n\nCousin Silas: Guitars & synths\n\nTitle from a short story by Jack ‘King’ Kirby.\n\n\n\n4: New Morning Star\n\nIssy: Djembe\n\nGoB: Anxiety Machine \n\n\n\n5: Le Livre des Mensonges\n\nCousin Silas: Guitar\n\nAntonella Porcelluzzi: Voice\n\nSpoken text from ‘The Book of Lies’ by Alistair Crowley from the AEP project ‘Introducing Alistair Crowley’\n\n\n\n6: Urban Nargual\n\nCousin Silas: Guitar and synths\n\nIssy: Bass loops and solo\n\nGreg Nieuwsma: Midi keys\n\n\n\n7: Radio Rapture\n\nCousin Silas: Guitar and synths\n\n\n\n8: The War on Saturnalia\n\nCousin Silas: Guitar and synths\n\n\n\n9: Throwing Bones\n\nCousin Silas: Guitar and synths",

      "about": "Kafou in Avalonia, dusted off with two new extra tracks. Both these tracks are reworks, one by myself, and one by GOB. \n\n\n\nOriginal Notes:\n\n\n\nAvalonia developed as a volcanic arc on the northern margin of Gondwana. It eventually rifted off, becoming a drifting microcontinent. The Rheic Ocean formed behind it, and the Iapetus Ocean shrank in front. It collided with the continents Baltica, then Laurentia, and finally with Gondwana, ending up in the interior of Pangea. When Pangea broke up, Avalonia's remains were divided by the rift which became the Atlantic Ocean.\n\n\n\nKafou in Avalonia imagines a world where the landmass remained connected and civilisation took a more integrated path.\n\n\n\n\"If The Future Sound Of London and Ash Ra Tempel recorded an album at Lee Scratch Perry’s black ark studio it might very well have sounded something like this. \" -- Monolith Cocktail\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally released June 19, 2020\n\n\n\nCousin Silas - Guitars, Samples & Keyboards\n\nThe Glove of Bones - Beats, loops, samples and rituals\n\n\n\nMastering - Rob Mellor",

      "about": "From the very first time I saw Alien I was truly captivated by the first shot of The Derelict. The scenes of the ship, both external and internal, the corridors, and the room with the Alien Pilot were something else. I'm a big fan of SF, and I've yet to be as impressed as I was on first viewing of this. Even now, after all these years, those scenes still resonate and haunt my imagination. Sadly, the Alien franchise went on to dilute that. The massive 'Space Jockey' now transformed into a human sized person with a wrap around space suit that was dwarfed in size by the original. \n\n\n\nOver the years I've done a couple or three Alien inspired pieces, but for some reason, probably with the upcoming Romulus, it has given me the impetus to finally get around to doing an aural impression from those moments of the first, and still greatest.",

Even in the unlikely case that You should be already familiar with all of them, there is much new music to be discovered that Cousin Silas and I have recorded between January and May 2024.\n\n\n\n(Below, You find a list which tracks were previously available, and which are new.)\n\n\n\nCousin Silas not only is a great artist, but also a joy to work with, and it never failed to baffle me how lighthandedly he would turn those rough sketches that I sent to him into real - and beautiful - music.\n\n\n\nI'm very grateful for the chance to work together with such talent!\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nPreviously available and now re-released:\n\n\n\nSilesia Parts 1 & 2 and Return to Silesia Parts 1 & 2\n\nInside The Complex\n\nTwo Trees\n\nFor Five Friends\n\n\n\nPreviously unreleased and brand new:\n\n\n\nPassage\n\nDiscoveries\n\nSpheres Parts 1 & 2\n\nKeplerian Orbit\n\nReunion\n\n\n\nSo - that's seven old and six new tracks BUT the new tracks have considerably longer running times (most of them...).\n\n\n\nENJOY!!!!",

      "about": "'Beats' and/or vocal samples in ambient has always been a contentious issue with some. To me, music is something you either like or don't regardless of the 'genre'. Sometimes it's fun and creative to break a few rules and jump the barriers. Not everything on here is truly ambient, but then again, what is these days? Even the early pioneers of ambient have expanded the original concept over time.\n\n\n\nPrimarily, this is a collection of music from members of the Cousin Silas Emporium showing the wide range and variety of music, not just ambient.\n\n\n\nMy thanks to all who took part. Hopefully, just enjoy this compilation for what it is.",

I think I started saying this around Volume 8, but there really can't be any more now! Famous last words.",

It is obvious, but I do seem to enjoy this time of year, probably more to do with warm memories, because everything thing else is cold, very cold.\n\n\n\nSurprisingly, many of you folks must have an affinity to this season as well because these Festive compilations seem to do really quite well.\n\n\n\nSome tracks are already on the Emporium Label, some are from We Are All Ghosts, and one or two exclusives.\n\n\n\nAs with the previous compilations I have done my best to avoid any tracks appearing here from the previous ones. \n\n\n\nEnjoy...",

Basically, I created 10 base tracks from which a variety of musicians will add their own material to these said 10 tracks. They can do whatever, add whatever even change or rearrange the order of the original tracks, which should provide some very intriguing collaborations. So, in my mind, it's only right that the series kicks off with myself and Scott.\n\n\n\nThis may well prove to be a very interesting project.",

They will suit those who have short attention spans. Secondly, quite a few radio/podcasters have said that due to the length of their show, the long pieces can't be used. So here's a selection of edits!\n\n\n\nHave one on me!",

      "about": "Welcome one and all, in this house those who have long since gone have soaked into the wood and stained the carpets, leaving memory painted rooms and the tales to resonate within the hallways. The house becomes aware of our presence and as they awaken, shadows take shape and linger, take form and start to stir. Noises from the basement, voices from the attic...clanging about like lost experiments and reclaiming their presence in the corridors. So much time since life has entered the house and the spirits have had their chance to rest, such slumber creates great hunger and the spirits must feast. Hasten away from the red-eyed teeth machine before the house devours you. The shadows hide many things and as the sun rises the beasts reside back to their eternal slumber. Whence the night passes the sun saves us. Whence the night passes the ghosts within relinquish their eternal rest and remain trapped in this house.",

      "about": "All these collected bonus tracks are from the Deluxe series on the Emporium Label, apart from the Twang Bonus tracks which are on the We Are All Ghosts Label. These Deluxe albums are re-releases of older albums whereby the labels they were released on either disappeared without notice or ceased publishing. A lot of people already have these original albums, so I thought it was time to give some of you a bonus!\n\n\n\nI've not included any Bonus tracks that are over 20 minutes. The main reason is they more or less double the size of the original release, so I reckon they're best where they are. Plus, all the Deluxe albums have been remastered as well.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, if you do indeed have the original albums, plus the Deluxe versions, this is why the two Bonus albums are Pay What You Want. I'm not out to rip anyone off. And they're not in chronological order, I wanted to mix them up a little and maybe give some of you something to do by working out which albums they come from!!",

      "about": "Still got my obsession with lost, abandoned and/or submerged villages from around the UK. All the tracks are named after these lost villages, and all of them can be found on the internet. Some of them have plenty of photos and information, although sadly, others are only mentioned briefly and even sadder, there's no photos. \n\n\n\nMardale Green and Ashopton appeared on This Loss by myself and Shane Beck, although they were, at that time, works in progress and untitled. So I suppose these, now with titles, are the 'instrumental' versions!!!",

      "about": "Lilliput and Portraits and Peelings were my first two forays as Cousin Silas. Lilliput was basically an EP whereas Portraits was more an album. They were both released on the Fflint Records label back in the early 2000's. To be fair, whilst all the material is mine, it was heavily remixed and re-realised by the then 'owners' of the label, Tim Jones and Barry Williams.\n\n\n\nThe Fflint label, up to that point, had only released material by Tim and Barry, either as collabs or solo material. so I felt quite honoured when Lilliput was accepted, and yes, as corny as this may sound, it kind of validated me as a 'musician'.\n\n\n\nThis is where I began, and whilst a large majority of the music is more experimental in nature there are signs and hints at where my music was heading. \n\n\n\n\n\nFflint and the lads will always hold a special place in my heart as they gave me confidence in what I was doing.\n\n\n\nBoth albums are here, in order, and have been remastered. Thanks again to Tim and Barry.",

This volume, like the previous one, tends to focus more on the atmosphere and mood of the whole festive period, both before and after.\n\n\n\nI reckoned to have made doubly sure that there are no tracks on here that appear on the first volume, but I do have more bad than good luck. Hopefully all's well. And again, there's a few unique tracks that haven't appeared on the Emporium Label before, some have.",

This is a VERY dark album.\n\n\n\nOriginal Sleevenotes: An album inspired by the various literary encounters I've had with Crowley, Parsons and Blavatsky. In journals like Fortean Times, the topic and subject of the 'occult' is often discussed and written about, and I've always found it rather interesting. The pieces on the album are a kind of aural soundscapes, moods, that were created with certain aspects of the occult in mind.",

Quite a lot come from the WAAG Label, but every track is an exclusive to the Emporium Label, however, the ones marked with * are exclusive to anywhere. These tracks have been created for this release.\n\nThe only exception to this is the opening track. I damn well love it, so why not!\n\n\n\nYou can also build or create your own album as all the tracks are individually downloadable. Grab the lot, or create an album of just the *. Happy days!",

It's truly appreciated.",

The music is either brand new, created especially for this project, or is older unreleased material and/or has been released before. The main idea is to showcase the musicians and their styles. It's not all about ambient, and as such, I'm hoping that, if nothing else, this project will show the breadth and width of music that is out there, or is now.",

      "about": "The Cousin Silas Emporium is a Facbebook group that began several years back. I have wanted to do an Emporium Members album for some time and finally got around to it. The majority of the material is solo material featuring the members own work. Whilst I am known, primarily, for creating ambient, the musicians in the Emporium are an incredibly diverse and creative bunch. So I wanted a project that would reflect their styles, not mine, showing the diversity of genres and creativity that they bring to the table.\n\n\n\nI have known many of the musicians for a fair time, indeed, I have collaborated with several of them, the results of which appear on the We Are All Ghosts Netlabel as Cousin Silas & Friends. There are a few collaborations in this series too, however, a couple of them are with artists who I have never collaborated with before, although we have been FB friends for years. Odd how things work out.\n\n\n\nMy good friend and Emporium member, Thomas Mathie, has created the cover/s. So this is indeed a full on Emporium Artists Project.",

      "about": "Abandoned villages, for me, are fascinating places. The lost history, the forgotten lives and the long gone murmer of rural life. What I find more intriguing, however, are those select few villages that have been lost with coastal erosion, or abandoned due to the valley where they were situated being 'converted' into reservoirs. In some cases parts of the buildings occasionally, during droughts or low tides, emerge. Urban legends of bells tolling from the old church, be that submerged or managing to breath again as the water slowly recedes.\n\n\n\nAll seven tracks are named, and partially inspired, by submerged villages. Obviously there are many more across the UK, but most featured are relatively 'local', or at least in Yorkshire and there's varying degrees of information about them on the Internet. Who'd have thought you could learn history whilst submerging yourself in music? I'd like to thank Si Rouse for the photo for the cover.",

It's surprising just how many lost settlements there are in the UK. Each and every one has, be they lost to history, a tale to tell.",

      "about": "There are many things that 'inspire' the music I do, but perhaps one of the most endearing is Winter. Apart from the usual cliches of transformation, and the memory echoes from childhood with its association with Christmas. It's also the way in which, at night, sounds are strangely muffled, morphed almost and how the landscape glitters and glows as though we have two full moons.\n\nI guess all that sounds a little pretentious, but as I say, I do have a rather abiding passion for Winter. \n\n\n\nMy thanks to Thomas Mathie for the cover/artwork.",

      "about": "An introduction, if you will, to what myself and Kevin Lyons have produced over the last few years. I can say without any doubt that I've never collaborated with anyone as much as I have with Kevin. It maybe stems from the fact that we are both big fans of horror and Science Fiction, be that in films or books (remember them?).\n\n\n\nI can't remember, off hand, exactly how many albums we've done. All the SF/Horror/Forteana inspired ones can be found on We Are All Ghosts (WAAG). Plus we did a live album the year before the Pandemic, and we were due to do another this year, but Science Fiction, became Fact, and got in the way. The Live album can be found on the Emporium Label.\n\n\n\nSo, with the aid of Andreas Schwietzke and Thomas Mathie, may I present to you a 2 and a half hour 'sampler' of some of our material. All these tracks have been remastered. You will also find that there are 3 exclusive bonus tracks for your edification.\n\n\n\nEnjoy.",

Can't go too far without coming across pumping stations working 24/7 to keep the sea and water at bay. The drone of the stations forever a part of the landscape. The material on this release is very much darker than my usual ambient, reflecting that uneasy feeling I have around dark water.",

And the title befits the moods of light and dark therein. I've used material from exitisting releases, but here's the thing. I have NO idea what they were. This was done on purpose, I basically made them 'anonymous' before I began work on them, mixed them around, sort of.\n\n\n\nThe format is much the same as a couple of releases I've done in the past such as Metamporphosis and Recrudescence.",

Recrudesence (breaking out afresh or into renewed activity; revival or reappearance in active existence). Recrudesence is on the WAAG label. The other is Metamophosis (changing). These experiments were basically taking existing pieces and changing them. Transforming them via a variety of ways, reversing, changing pitch, adding reverb, etc etc. Also, in some cases, adding extra bits here and there. Some worked, some didn't. They're really just remixed/re-imagined. In my world it's classed as messing about. The original pieces I used were intentionally forgotten, even I am not sure what, or where the pieces come from or what they were called. And yes, this was intentional.",

      "about": "Not actually defending myself here, but personally I think 'Samplers' are a great way to introduce new listeners. This collection features many and varied ambient pieces from albums on here. I know it seems crazy because people can just listen to the tracks anyway, so what's the point? Well, none really, I just wanted to make my next million. \n\n\n\nTo be fair, there are a few exclusive tracks tucked in and amongst the 'regular' tracks. And the album is pay what you want, so I'm not exactly milking it!",

Most of the solo material was created with a guitar and the Fishman Triple Play. The three Silas/Lyons live ones were created with this as well as guitar and synths, depends on who got on what first.\n\n\n\nAs can be imagined (or not) we had a truly great time and hopefully this won't be the last, although 2020 has curtailed it for this year. \n\n\n\nThe tracks on this are, in some places, ambient, others more experimental. There are hints and nods towards our previous work (all on WAAG), but we feel it's different enough to stand alone from our SF/Horror/Fortean material to warrant 'some' interest.\n\n\n\nEach and every track was recorded in one take, purely improvised and contain no overdubs or editing apart from the odd fade out here and there.",

Very supportive of many artists and many artists thought highly of him. We did perhaps one unique collaboration, and then Wolfgang took off on his own... Let me explain.\n\n\n\nHe was perhaps the most unique collaborator I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Once he got hold of the reins, he was off! He'd pick established, and published tracks of mine, embellish,add and enhance them, then send them me. I literally had no idea which tracks he would pick, how they would sound. They just appeared, finished. And yes, I was more than happy with them all. It seems strange, in hindsight, but the opening track, Absent Agreements, was basically how these collaborations worked! In fact, are they collaborations? Are they re-realisations? Remixes? Whatever they are, they worked for us.\n\n\n\nWe did three albums in total. I plan to re-release all three, each one being remastered and each having three extra bonus tracks. These bonus tracks come from other compilations, projects and tributes. But all are most definitely done Wolfgang's way, bless him. The lad will be missed.",

I say collaboration, but as I mentioned on the previous re-release, I didn't really work with Wolfgang in the typical collaborative way. He picked tracks I'd done, and worked on them, and they just appeared, finished, or enhanced let's say.\n\n\n\nI was, and still aren't really sure what to call them, maybe re-realised, or enhanced, reworked? Whatever the definition, he did a great job and added much more to them.\n\n\n\nThe three bonus tracks are taken from compilations, and side projects. I do hope you enjoy the 'extra' something Wolfgang added to these.",

      "about": "Originally Released 2016.\n\n\n\nRemastered, with new artwork.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes By George De Bruin: Sometimes Cousin Silas just has an urge. In this case, he felt the sudden onset of the desire to compose and release a recording of dark ambient music. And, when that desire hit, it only took him a day or two to complete the work. (Or, at least, that’s how it appeared on Facebook.) This is a release that displays another side of Cousin Silas’s creative potency: the ability to create dark, abstract sounds for brooding, meditative scenarios.\n\n\n\nA peek inside the dark conflicts of nature and the dark side of the nature of humanity. From the conflicts that arise from seasonal change, to the conflicts we face for our actions, and even the connection between the conflicts of nature and the state of humanity. It seems that there is a lot of darkness around the world. Many countries are involved in some form of social or political sturggles with darkness. While Mr. Hughes might not address these topics directly, his music seems fitting to the current moods of the world. And, it seems possible a bit of that darkness has been channeled into these works (at least to my ears). And yet, even with all the darkness that permeates these pieces, there is the occasional glimpses of light through the clouds.",

      "about": "As you may or may not know, I have a lot of releases on the fantastic Netlabel, We Are All Ghosts (WAAG). I consider WAAG as a 'sister' label, albeit older and perhaps wiser. It's run by Thomas Mathie, who also does quite a lot of the artwork both on Waag and here on the Emporium Label. Indeed, that's how we got into a 'working' relationship. Thomas became my 'go-to' chap for many album covers. He started WAAG to curate Silas albums, and over the years, it has expanded to include many other fine artists. It's also home to my Twang Projects, the Cousin Silas & Friends and, of course, the Dronescape Series. \n\n\n\nI felt it fitting to release a sampler on the Emporium Label as a simple guide and a nudge nudge that WAAG has a lot of Silas (and other) releases on there. Sadly, there just isn't room (or the logistics) to have anything from the Dronescapes, Silas & Friends or the Twang Projects. Yes, even if I admit it myself, there's just too much.\n\n\n\nSo, I hope you enjoy the humble offerings. My continuing thanks to Thomas for starting WAAG and all his efforts. Each track mentions which album it comes from, and if you want to peruse, here's the link to WAAG. \n\n\n\nweareallghosts.bandcamp.com",

      "about": "Remastered and featuring new artwork.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by George De Bruin (2015): Cousin Silas and I have something in common: writing. During the 1990’s he penned many short stories that appeared in small magazines. He was also the editor of a magazine for several years. To this day he is a voracious reader of classic Science Fiction. His love of literature has informed his music (the epitome of which is his excellent Ballard Landscape series of recordings).\n\n\n\nOn Observations From Earth And Beyond Cousin Silas merges his love of science fiction and literature with some personal observations. The result is a release about our relationships to space and each other.\n\nSailing Through The Kuiper Belt opens this release by taking us on a journey through a circumstellar disc that extends from the edge of Neptune towards the Sun. The Kuiper Belt is outside of our solar system, and is 20 times as wide and 20 to 200 times as massive as\n\nthe asteroid belt in our solar system. Among The Stars carries the theme of celestial travel beyond the Kuiper Belt.\n\nGalactic Lense brings us back to earth with an observation about man using the universe to understand the universe better. We’ve found a way to use galaxies as a lense to measure other galaxies size, proportion and age.\n\nColour Change is central to our perception that we often overlook it. From the changing of leaves during the fall, to the change of colours of celestial bodies. Rising and Ascension share the theme of our looking towards the skies. Looking at the mysteries and the wonders of things\n\nbeyond this world.\n\nOn the earthbound side of this release are tracks like Lament for Ebow and Two Loops, Song For Candy and The Old Church In Summer Rain. These songs touch on the relationships between ourselves, our mysticism, and our feelings for each other. Such feelings and perceptions of each other and space find common ground on Sleeping Under Nebula Dreaming About You (For I.v.).",

      "about": "Remastered, with new artwork.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes By George De Bruin: Cousin Silas is full of surprises, and this release is no exception. In fact. there are cases where he pushes the limits of expectation. But the funny part is: he challenges us without so much as a nod or even the slightest hint of self-awareness of the gauntlet he’s thrown down. The Sky Road is a perfect example of such a challenge: the opening epic piece would be enough for a whole release from some artists. But, in this case, it’s only half the story.\n\nAfter revealing a work of many continuous layers that seem to be constantly opening and drifting, there are still four more tracks to explore. Each track builds on the last, presenting an ever growing expanse of sparsely populated space. The sounds within these spaces reverberating throughout.

This release is based on ebow loops, with pads and guitar to create hypnotic, slowly evolving soundscapes that will fit your mood. This work is as abstract as several other recent CerebralAudio releases, including The Sky Road. It’s a calm and serene set of pieces that have an implied rhythm without forcing any real percussive elements on the listener. Whether it’s music that you need for meditation, or something to help focus on a task that you need to accomplish, this is the work for you. Indulge yourself in 80 minutes of constantly evolving and transforming soundscapes of Cousin Silas.",

      "about": "Originally released in 2017.\n\n\n\nRemastered, with new artwork.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes By George De Bruin: Cousin Silas takes us into the cold depths of winter with Snowline. It feels like being high up on a snow capped mountain. Your breath crystalizes before you in the air. All around is peaceful and calm, with a gentle wind blowing about. Snow is drifting along a crest, forming a snow bank that obstructs your view. Up here, the snowline exists year-round, but in the middle of winter the tremendous walls of snow make the mountain a different experience: cold, pristine, and white as far as the eye can see.\n\nDespite the plummeting temperatures, you can feel the warmth of the perfection of this place. Is it just layer-on-layer of clothes insulating you? Or have you reached the stage of hypothermia when you start feeling warmer despite your body temperature? Being in this cold for over an hour is starting to have it’s effects on you physically and mentally. You can either go home and rest where it is safe, or you can start your journey into the cold depths above the Snowline with Cousin Silas again.",

Whilst I haven’t done a Ballard collection for some time now, all my albums since Ballard Landscapes 2 have had at least one track on there that has been related to ‘something’ Ballardian. I find his locations and moods so evocative and I really can’t see me ever consciously (or otherwise) stopping. The Ballard albums have proved to be some of my most popular albums and I think it would be naïve of me to think it was just the music rather than the man who inspired them that attracts people to these albums. Either way, I do hope you enjoy this third collection and I would like to thank Jack Hertz for giving me the opportunity to be have had the chance to be fully inspired again by Ballard.",

This journey concludes with the view of a brown dwarf star, known as a “cold star”. Cold stars have long been the subject of science fiction, having been referenced in many novels and TV series. In science cold stars are commonly known as brown dwarfs, (or “failed stars”) which are unable to create their own energy due to the lack of molecular cohesion. The result is they give off a faint light based only on the energy they were born with.\n\n\n\nThe original version this release is still available on CerbralAudio.",

This is a new, remastered edition and available on Bandcamp for the first time.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Emiliano Pietrini: Sky Watching, album arose from the prolific and compelling inspiration of the Britsih Artist Cousin Silas, is a sonic work which blends gentler beats with oneiric guitar-scapes and evocative ambient textures. The structure soon opens up and allows room for traversing strings of bliss, all the while the diffuse background becomes clearer and brighter. Darker helixes are presented over the course of the tracks, but whenever the effulgence seems to iridesce between unpretentious colors, the majestic guitar layers tower above this soil and retain the solemnity. The widened frequency range is another marker: an aqueously turquoise-tinted stretched tone swirl glows its way through the cavernous vault, gyrating between gleaming hope and austere prudence. Silas' approach of merging these frequencies, decorticating their innermost essences and using these nutritious superfluids in order to create floating nebulas is further refined, or to say it in a less prosaic manner: the unison of the guitar drones and their plinking beats counterpoints regularly turns into something splendidly luring. The reverberated sound quality, the shimmering gradient, the blue tint of the crystalline entities altogether work really well with the highly recognizable guitars and synths. It is this distinctive addendum that makes \"Sky Watching\" an uplifting trip towards dreamlike multicolored skies.",

      "about": "Remastered.\n\n\n\nIt seems 2016 was 'the' year for releases on the Hortus Conclusus label. Here it is for the first time on Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Emiliano Pietrini: Cousin Silas' \"Lift The Sky\" is intensive, lush, and presents the mellow kind of soothing darkness that inspires you rather than scaring you off by crushing your good mood. The guitar strings are so vivid, powerful, multilayered and liquid that they create a flow that washes the listener away into a dark maelstrom of oneiric melodies, melancholic intersections, superb solemnity and poetic caresses. Don’t expect overly convoluted or deep percussions because the mellow beats are much reduced and purposefully minimalistic in order to let the guitars shine. This is an Ambient album of the finest kind, it builds blurry visions in order to create an otherworldly universe with the cherubic bliss and sonic uniqueness of the author that is confirmed, or even better amplified, by the milestone of his 150th album. Audiophiles and refined listeners, but not only them, will be more than pleased with it.",

First time on Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Emiliano Pietrini: The gateway to Cousin Silas' \"Contrasts\" offers much delight and is enormously meaningful to the connoisseur of the most refined ambient music in particular and heterodyned Guitar/Drone dioramas in general. The slow fade-in phase with its wondrously argentine-colored cloudlets and eminently elasticized melodic flashes of distant galaxies prepares the listening subject of the things to come. Admixed aerose microglitters and heating circulation-based exhalations create a fittingly oneiric vision that is driven by a reticulation of infinity and wideness, giving birth spontaneously to the perfect soundtrack to underline your reverie.",

Now remastered and available on Bandcamp for the first time.\n\n\n\nHere are the original release notes by Emiliano Pietrini : \"A Fall Of Moondust\" is an album that captures a lightweight oneric physiognomy and transports this feeling via soothing guitar sound waves to the ears of the listeners. If there is one particular strength that truly distinguishes Silas' ambient compositions from the well-populated genre, it is the merciless focus on sharply carved-out but eternally smooth melodies. Don't expect convoluted drone layers, eclectic beat patterns or the misty reverberation of plinking chimes which fades into the pitch-black distance. No, this is essentially (and frankly wonderfully) an album that gathers six simple – but not simplistic – evocative melodies. I am using the term simple on purpose and do not intend to degrade the compositional qualities or ornaments in any way. I use it in order to explicate Silas' straightforward approach. It is downright refreshing sometimes to hear crunchy, organic, clear melodies without the usual molecules and post-effects that are often applied to the ambient, dark ambient and drone genre. Set the speakers at the louder possible volume and the whole immensity of the universe will be painted in your room.",

First time on Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nNow remastered but retaining the wonderful cover and cd artwork.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Emiliano Pietrini: I often try to find a parallel between an album’s title and what I can perceive in the music, and in this particular album, I have found a lot of my own thoughts illustrated across the caressive flow of notes bloomed by Cousin Silas' guitar scapes. \"Between Worlds\" is the perfect soundtrack to everything that is happening in your head during that enveloping moment of isolation when you find yourself in the middle of those parallel inner universes that most of us inhabit. It mirrors a feeling that you’re all alone in this concrete puzzle, radiated by its pulsating lights and shadows, while you’re actually surrounded by hundreds of thousands of metaphors and allegories. This is exactly what you’ll find on this thrilling and soothing album, but as impressions that have been skillfully transformed into sound - a sound that is somehow tangible and somewhat distant, yet at the same time incredibly poetic and introspective as if it is only yours to witness.",

Now here on Bandcamp for the first time, remastered, of course.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Emiliano Pietrini: Cousin Silas’ \"Catharsis\" has the novelistic detail engrained in its title already, and the focus on tranquility and placidity is equally open to scrutiny. But the actual work, meaning the 9 drone-based guitar soundscapes, resides in the tropopause, with all its glucans, vesicles and fermions equally touched by light and liquid. The former is not always transparent, the latter not necessarily prone to serve as an amniotic compound of enlightenment. In fact, \"Catharsis\" is surprisingly keen on targeting obliquity more than anything else. It sits between the poles. It embraces cenobitism only to then refer to its dissociation, venturing into areas and ancillary routes that are unexpectedly far away. It is the nutraceutical light that helps the listener and brings him or her back into the figurative spot. Despite the occasional touch of dreamy mysticism, there is never an \"ignis fatuus\" or friar’s lantern to be encountered, the traveling subject isn’t trapped. It is just the chirality that makes one think so from time to time, that is the asymmetry between the original artistic thought and the mirrored guitars that are telling stories.... tales.... dreams.....",

From the initial release of Lilliput back in 2001, there's been a steady, indeed, some would say prolific output of albums, eps and appearances on well over 15 compilations. He's appeared on Fflint Central, Earthrid, Earth Monkey Productions, Stone Premonitions, Just Not Normal Records, Kopp Netlabel, Electric Music, Black Square, BFW Recordings, and Independent Opposition. \n\n\n\nCanaveral Dreams is his 12th release. As with many of his later releases, it's a mixture of light ambient, atmospheric, moody and dark Ballardian soundscapes - a veritable potpourrie of sonic textures and aural landscapes.",

      "about": "This album began its life on a label that suddenly went AWOL. It was kindly taken up by Hortus Conclusus and re-released in 2017, now Remastered, and on Bandcamp for the first time.\n\n\n\nOriginal notes by Emiliano Pietrini: Cousin Silas' \"Over Moors and Silver Streams\" is a striking ambient apotheosis composed by a hour and 20 minutes single track embraced by an aesthetic amalgamation of sustained sounds and prolonged periods of silence. Crystalline sine tones evoke the feeling of being entrapped in an arcane antrum, everything feels lactational and utterly soothing. The plasticity of this piece makes it a show-stopper, for the meandering sonic waves and magnanimous moments of quiescence evoke a stasis of emptiness, the latter of which is as important a part as the actual vanillarific guitar chords. The moments of silence and contemplation not only swallow the sustain of the sound sources, they are also contrastive backdrops for their decay, allowing the listening subject to absorb the thermal heat and illumined surfaces before the inner eye.",

And if I remember correctly, it was the first album to feature the artwork of one Thomas Mathie... small world eh?\n\n\n\nIt's has now been remastered and comes with two unique bonus tracks.\n\n\n\nHere are the original notes from BFW: Beautiful and chilled. 'The Snow Imposed Silence' is the wonderful new album from Cousin Silas. Many of you will know this music from his previous releases on Fflint Central, Earth Monkey and justnotnormal, as well as appearances on several compilations. But for those of you new to this artist, this is a lush, drifting ambient album. Think of Namlook or Tangerine Dream and you are somewhere close, though this album has a unique flavour.",

      "about": "Remastered.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Glenn Sogge: Studio presents you the first Silas/Candy L collaborative album to be released in two years. Scenes from a Forest. A collection of ambient, with a bit of dark and experimental in the mix. We both hope you enjoy our creations. \n\n\n\nIt's always a nice thing to get a preview listen to new music, especially when it is made by a couple of your favorite collaborators working together. Cousin Silas and Candy L have taken the core of contemporary ambient and dark ambient music into their very souls and let it back out again through fingers comfortable with keys, strings, frets, and synthesizers.\n\n\n\nThe best \"concept albums\" are about ideas -- not just telling stories. With \"Forest\", musical evocations of different aspects of the idea of a forest are explored. What follows could be one story out of many possible stories.\n\n\n\nThe journey begins as \"As We Enter A Dark Forest\" with only hints of foreboding peeking through the sensuous leaves and branches of lush pads, long guitar tones, and occasional ripples of a piano like a slow stream sparkling. \n\n\n\nIt's always a nice thing to get a preview listen to new music, especially when it is made by a couple of your favorite collaborators working together.

The temperature is getting lower but glints of earlier setting sunlight still break through. The background stills uncomfortably shifts around as if hiding behind those trunks.\n\n\n\n\"Dewdrops\" remind us to look down, to watch our steps, even as we delight in pockets of watery light showing us the way. Nothing happens too quickly as we gaze from place to place. We are deeper in the woods but take comfort in the sounds that have grown familiar with their edge of unease. Fragments come and go, resembling each other like water-jewelled webs that are still unique.\n\n\n\nIt must be night now. We can only hear the 'Something Unseen.\" It could be the wind. Or it could be something else. Something closer.\n\n\n\nDeep in the grove, we hear \"A Poem\". The low tones put an ominous minor feel to the lighter lines of voices luxuriating over each syllable of the lines making the stanzas. Some of the wildlife awakens and tries to chirp it's way above the still present ground of dark being.\n\n\n\nEventually, though, \"The Birds Stopped Singing\" and one begins to hear hints of other things around in the wood.\n\n\n\nSoon, it sounds like owls and other denizens of the night are the only critters under the \"Dark Canopy.\" Well, except for that occasional scrape of metal, the rattle of something woody, a repeating pattern of an abandoned machine, a branch falling through other branches, a flurry of wings (too loud for an owl.) Low drones have settled in for the unsettleness. \n\n\n\nAnd, then, \"Snow Arrives\". Not with the gentle drifting of flakes but with changeable weather and storms that remind us that snow can bring avalanches, too.\n\n\n\nA \"Forest Drone\" brings us out of snowfall to just a shiny sheet that may lie in a clearing or beyond the forest edge.\n\n\n\nWe end on \"The Old Road That Suddenly Stops.\" Are we finally all the way in? Or did we leave by the wrong fork?\n\n\n\nThe underlying sense of uncertainty and anxiety never leaves although it is more prominent is same places than others. This is clearly an unfamiliar forest, one that we don't know as well as the one we built forts in as kids. This forest has so many corners that could be hiding something.\n\n\n\nThat was the album I heard. I don't know (and won't even ask) if that was the album that Candy and Cousin hoped to make. But the one I heard is beautifully executed and plumbs the depths of ideas and technology. Music is a way of decorating time. With \"Forest,\" everything takes the time it takes -- no more, no less. It is clear that Cousin and Candy have worked together over the years. Other than Cousin's signature guitar lines, you can't tell who is responsible for what sounds. (I might even be wrong about the guitar as Candy is a talented multi-instrumentalist, too.) This is a quite enjoyable 77 minutes that drags ideas, glimpses, and gut feelings through the mind.\n\n-Glenn Sogge \n\n\n\nOriginally released August 8, 2019\n\n\n\nCousin Silas & Candy L (Lozier): All compositions, synthesized and live music with sound.\n\n\n\nCover photo by Oleg Tishkovets with photo manipulation by Studio.\n\n\n\nOur heartfelt thanks to Glenn Sogge for the following:\n\nThe excellent album mastering and the lovely review!",

As Cousin Silas explains it, there are a number of older tracks from various compilations and other projects that he wanted to unite. Also, in each addition, Silas will take a drone already on Studio 4632 and re-work it. (On this album, Ebb is the chosen remake.)\n\nAt present, it is planned to have four volumes of tracks for the project, and Studio is truly pleased to be bringing them to you! Each volume will be skillfully mastered by Glenn Sogge. As for the album content, it is beautifully aged ambient, mastered to accentuate the lush synths and guitars and produce excellent atmosphere. Enjoy Orphans One.\n\n\n\nOriginally released June 30, 2019\n\n\n\nCousin Silas: All original compositions, music and sounds.\n\n\n\nGlenn Sogge: Audio track mastering (with a slight, re-tickling by Silas).",

All of them will be remastered (courtesy of Glenn Sogge), and each album will feature a 'bonus' track. These bonus tracks are shorter reworkings of existing long form 'drones\".\n\n\n\nVolume two, like one, is a mixed bag. It has a very powerful and poignant beginning in \"Inside The Enclosure (The Creature Dreams)\", an outstanding piece of music.The powerful music continues throughout and we get to enjoy more than an ample share of the distinctive and expressive Silas guitar. Music and sound of this quality just begs for more and I for one can't wait to hear volumes three and four!\n\n\n\nAll in all there are ten excellent tracks in volume two, seventy seven minutes of musical reverie.\n\n\n\nEnjoy Orphans Two by Cousin Silas.\n\n\n\nGlenn Sogge: Audio track mastering (and slight re-tickling by Silas)\n\n\n\nOriginally released July 21, 2019\n\n\n\nCover by Studio",

This is the first of two Calm projects. The remaining three albums, after the two Beats and two Calm albums, are three Dark (ambient) albums.\n\n\n\nThis album consists of fourteen mellow tunes; wordless songs filled with moments, memories, musings, times and places. And which impart a lovely mystical quality to the album. This album is, in my opinion, Silas at his very best; reaching out into meaningful memories, and quiet contemplations. There is focus and personal expression in the music. Music that is wonderfully unique to Cousin Silas.\n\n\n\nI will say enjoy this album, although I don't have to. I know you will.\n\n\n\nOriginally released December 19, 2018\n\n\n\nAlbum design Candy L\n\n\n\nAll compositions and performance by Cousin Silas.",

This album is a bit more ambient than volume 1. Thirteen excellent tracks with five more volumes in the series to look forward to!\n\n\n\nThe great majority of the pieces that Silas carefully selected for the project came from the various original Midnight Radio V/A Compilations over the years. These of course organized by Midnight Radio founder and friend Norbert Kutz , aka Eisenlager. Several other included tracks are previously unreleased and referred to by Silas as coming from \"older, more obscure compilations, from years ago\", created when the maestro was, in his words, \"actually me finding my 'direction', really, really early material.\" Some from as long ago as 2000!\n\n\n\nSo, this album series promises to be filled with the discovery and re-discovery of some of the great music Cousin Silas has brought us over the course of his prolific tenure as a master of ambient, an experimentalist and a beat maker too.\n\n\n\nEnjoy this second album, Midnight Beats 2.\n\n\n\nOriginally released December 3, 2018\n\n\n\nAll compositions and performance by Cousin Silas.",

This would be anything that showcases his amazing talent and technique on the guitar.\n\n\"In Dub\" does just this. On this excellent 8 track album, Silas is a one man Dub machine! He is the drummer, bassist, guitarist, and keyboard/synth man all in one! Loaded with an array of nicely selected background sound fx, drums on high reverb, perfect bass lines connecting beats and instruments, electric guitar strums and arty leads with fades and fx in all of the right places, In Dub offers an amazing, bluesy, spacey, psychedelic, 72 minute sonic experience!\n\nAs excellent as his best ambient! Just dubbed, is all.\n\nEnjoy \"In Dub\"!\n\n\n\nOriginally released September 29, 2017\n\n\n\nCover by Studio\n\n\n\nAll compositions, music and performance by Cousin Silas.",

      "about": "Remastered.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes By Candy: Through a mist of moods and memories, lovely sounds and melodies emerge: a blend of synths and strings, defining piano notes and guitar chords / riffs floating. Ambient pieces. Ballads. Traditional pieces. This new addition to the Cousin Silas \"Midnight\" album series is another excellent compilation of the Maestro's amazing music. Welcome to Midnight Calm 2. Twelve musical memories for your listening enjoyment.\n\n\n\nStudio welcomes this new volume from the Cousin Silas \"Midnight\" album series. The great majority of the pieces that Cousin Silas carefully selected for this project came from various original Midnight Radio V/A Compilations. These of course organized by Midnight Radio founder and friend Norbert Kutz, aka Eisenlager. Several other included tracks are previously unreleased and referred to by Silas as coming from \"older, more obscure compilations, from years ago\", created when the maestro was, in his words, \"actually me finding my 'direction', really, really early material.\" Some from as long ago as 2000!\n\n\n\nEnjoy Midnight Calm 2 and stay tuned for future volumes!\n\n\n\nOriginally released February 10, 2019\n\n\n\nAll compositions & music by Cousin Silas. \n\n\n\nCover by Studio",

In this album, Dark Moons, Silas has captured the mass and grandeur of the most distant moons in our solar system, from Neptune, Jupiter and Saturn. And with Phobos, one a bit closer to home; Mars. We also sense the isolation, volatility, and the coldness of these largest of the moons. The nearly 80 minutes of music is grand, deep, filled with space and movement, fading in lingering echoes into the vast darkness. Another superb album from the maestro of ambient!

Several other included tracks are previously unreleased and referred to by Silas as coming from \"older, more obscure compilations, from years ago\", created when the maestro was, in his words, \"actually me finding my 'direction', really, really early material.\" Some from as long ago as 2000!\n\n\n\nSo, this album series promises to be filled with the discovery and re-discovery of some of the great music Cousin Silas has brought us over the course of his prolific tenure as a master of ambient, an experimentalist and a beat maker too.\n\n\n\nThe series gets off to a resoundingly good start with the thirteen track Midnight Beats 1. Beginning with the opening track, Green Mist, the album is an amazing collection of various style ditties, all performed flawlessly and with lots of superb guitar riffs and leads. And lovely beats of course. A truly excellent musical project by Cousin Silas. Enjoy Midnight Beats 1. \n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally released October 26, 2018\n\n\n\nAll compositions, synthesized sound and live performance by Cousin Silas.\n\nCover by Studio.",

Inspired by one of his favorite literary people, H.P. Lovecraft, Silas has created this amazing 3 piece drone to the Lovecraftian dark world and imagery.\n\n\n\nAs for the album, words, reviews, even reputation, never quite describe the quality of amazing music. One has to listen. And what's wrong with that? This trilogy is a lovely 75 plus minutes of sublime dark, supernatural ambient; flawlessly composed, perfectly presented in it's tense, ethereal stillness. Effortless listening.\n\n\n\nPlease enjoy Cousin Silas with Liminal Dronescapes 8, 9 and 10, Three Shades Of Lovecraft.\n\n\n\nOriginally released September 24, 2018\n\n\n\nCompositions and performance by Cousin Silas.\n\nCover by Studio.",

      "about": "Remastered.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes By Candy: Studio welcomes a new Cousin Silas album! Quite a remarkable album at that! Short Stories, a wonderful suite of 30 short, but absolutely complete, musical pieces. Composed in various styles, and with his mainstay of instruments, guitar, synth, and keys, Silas has woven what I suspect is a lovely trip down memory lane.\n\n\n\nThe music is excellent! Every bit of it. Nothing new in that! And definitely reflects the multi talents of this prolific ambient composer /guitar maestro, who just released his 200th album on our friend label, Weareallghosts!!  (weareallghosts.bandcamp.com/album/unlimited-boundaries-waag-rel114)\n\n\n\n The pieces are light, dark, and somewhere in between. The three tribute piano pieces for Wolfgang Gsell are especially beautiful. Soft piano ballads, very tasty guitar pieces, deep, meditative synths, darker synths laden with even darker sounds, even a drum solo. Nicely varied, well placed, to keep the sounds flowing.\n\nI would consider this one of the artist's best collections. (Among the many.) The title may be understated, short and sweet; the music is definitely not. This is an album quite large on creativity, skill and wonderfully poignant and powerful imagination. Following on the heels of his breakaway 200th, Silas proves once again that he is... more\n\n\n\nOriginally released April 12, 2018\n\n\n\nCousin Silas: All compositions and music. \n\n\n\nCover by Studio",

Dark Days And Sacrificial Nights.\n\nDiverting from the light and gentle ambience of volume six (Spring), this volume is cast in the darker folds of neo classical ambient. At the risk of repeating myself, the only Cousin Silas ambient I like better than his light variety is his dark variety. No one can weave a better drone than Silas, as evidenced by his many drone projects. And volume 7 is no exception. It is meticulously crafted to be a seamless and immersive journey through excellent music and sound. Enjoy Liminal Dronescape 7, Dark Days And Sacrificial Nights. \n\n\n\nOriginally released July 13, 2018\n\n\n\nAll compositions and performance by Cousin Silas.\n\nAlbum cover design by Studio.",

Electronic experimentalist artist extraordinnaire! Dawn is, by her own definition, an Alaskan Native, electronic music producer, and visionary artist (no doubt about this!) whose focus is atmospheric sound design. Dawn is always in support of her fellow artists and maintains several great FB groups to further our connections!\n\nWe also welcome back Mr. I.v. Martinez, aka Total E.T, aka experiMENTALien, is also an experimental music producer. Among his many projects and monikers are: TOTAL E.T., T.R.I.v.M., mutanT.R.I., TOTALITNY REZIM (with Couchniere, Jagelsson & Johnanny), XENOUND (with Walter Lapchynski) and SS project (with Cesar Naves). He, like Dawn Tuesday, is a regular collaborator with Cousin Silas.\n\nAnd we always welcome our friend, Cousin Silas. A prolific composer who crosses lines, borders and genres at will, whenever... more\n\n\n\nOriginally released March 28, 2018\n\n\n\nAll compositions and music: Dawn Tuesday, Total E.T. and Cousin Silas \n\n\n\nCover by Studio",

      "about": "Remastered.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes By Candy: Mechanics Of Solitude is another exceptional musical collection composed by Maestro and ambient guitarist Cousin Silas. An eclectic journey through solitude. And memories, a common focus of his album themes.\n\nThe album is replete with guitar. And guitar overlays. And splendid keys and synths. In a diverse mix of dronescapes, meditative melodies, voiceless ambient ballads, ethereal musings.\n\nSilas is a master at creating music that \"sounds\" like the message it carries. As with September Sunrise. Rhythm Of The Clouds. Still Of The Night (an amazing ambient guitar track). Before Dawn. You can hear the windswept leaves, the air moving clouds, feel the dark and quiet night, the aura of anticipation. Or expectation. Or hesitation. You can sense the night disappearing into the sunrise, hear slumbering people waking just before dawn.\n\nI have always been partial to the soft side of Silas music. Although I enjoy all of it. Mechanics Of Solitude stands out as one of his best. It is a flawless mastery of tools and technique, knowing the message of the music and which sounds best bring it to the listener, and an innate understanding of what \"beautiful\" sounds like.\n\nAn amazingly good album. Enjoy!\n\n\n\nOriginally released February 2, 2018\n\n\n\nAll compositions and music by Cousin Silas\n\nCover design by Nicholas Crombez.",

This is the first joy associated with Cousin Silas and Martin Neuhold. The second is obviously the incredible music that emanates from these grand masters of idea, sound and performance.\n\nThis album is, in a word, beautiful. The artistry, the lovely melodies that move you, make you feel, flow through all eight pieces. Some tracks are deep and wistful, nostalgic. Others, like Anticipation Of A New Day, are hopeful and brighter. Throughout, the piano is truly flawless, as is the guitar, perfectly complementing the other. Studio is so pleased to bring this amazingly good album to you! It will make you think and feel, remember, to me an essential of truly great music.

Light and melodic, almost symphonic!\n\nYou can never expect anything less than amazing from the music of Cousin Silas. This album is no exception.

Pristine instrumentation and production, with all of the usual Silas delights of ambience, atmosphere, melody, and sensory awakening! Yes, this is indeed a lovely \"drift\" album.\n\n\n\nThe album appropriately starts out with a 31 minute track titled \"The Migration Begins\". Classic lush ambient with a panoramic quality.\n\nThe album overall has a panoramic feel to it. With \"Cascades Of Autumn\", you feel like you are floating through the vastness of a clear blue autumn sky. \"Mission Accomplished\" is a gentle, melodic, synth and guitar delight! Again, the wonderful feel of atmosphere and drifting.\n\nThe title track, \"Panoramica\", is the still quiet of an evening sky peppered with stars and other pieces of cosmic entities.\n\n\"Above The Blue\" and \"Franklin Point\" are a bit darker and more guitar based but filled with the same atmosphere and sound.\n\nThe album ends with \"Spindrift\". A perfectly played, clean electric ambient guitar piece, filled with the most lovely reverb.\n\n\n\nOriginally released January 6, 2017\n\n\n\nCousin Silas: All compositions and music \n\n\n\nArtwork Studio 4632",

      "about": "Remastered.\n\n\n\nOriginal Notes by Candy:\n\nLandscapes. Another amazing ambient construction by Cousin Silas. The commonality of this soothingly melodic, yet intricate, album, is that all tracks are composed of pads and keys, augmented by some perfectly placed riffs of guitar, (for which the artist is so noted, and at which he excels). And that they are all landscapes; of thought, feeling, places and memory. Cousin Silas is a master at conveying these very things that lie behind many of his compositions.\n\nThe album starts out with End Of Days, which sets a reflective tone to the first few tracks in this collection.\n\nFollowed by Lament For Solitude. I love this track. The key work is amazing, with a guitar overlay that perfectly compliments.\n\nJanuary Skies has a backdrop of string and synth swells which provide some nice atmosphere for the piano melody.\n\nIce Ferns is a track which has personal meaning for me. Cousin Silas, who I am honored to call a friend, composed this beautiful piece for me and my sister, upon the passing of our precious Father this past Christmas eve.\n\nLandscaping changes tone. Lofty pads, ethereal strains of guitar, and tender keys paint a brighter landscape, and float gracefully on for a lovely 12+ minutes!\n\nThe Abandoned Garden is another impressive display of Silas' key work! The injection of a short strain of natural sound effects was a perfect addition. Listen for them!\n\nWith The Old Room, Near The Delta and Ages Before, the distant guitars, the receding synths, speak to some thing, some time, or someone, remembered. Be sure to catch the lovely string finale in Near The Delta! \n\nWater Mapping is the longest track, brightly meandering along with an arpeggiated piano chord background that adds a very nice touch. Movement, from the conversation of wind chimes, the tremolo guitar, to the faint whispers of chorale, describes the perfectly chosen final track, Portraits. I equate this piece with life moving on. Past, remembered; present, observed; future, considered. The landscapes of life. \n\n\n\nCover by Studio\n\n\n\nOriginally released February 1, 2017\n\n\n\nCousin Silas: All compositions and music",

Winter.\n\nI doubt that there is anything I can pen here that hasn't already been said about this gifted artist. He is a paragon of musicality. There is no musical frontier he is unwilling to challenge. No ambient offshoot he is hesitant to attempt. This artist goes boldy, and yet with great modesty and humbleness, into the uncharted waters of music. I have listened to almost all of Cousin Silas' music; the ambient, the non, the creations that can't be genre-fied. His mastery of the tools of his art form give testimony to his passion for it. This is also evident in his output. Which, by any standards, is massive! However he does it, the end result is consistently amazing. Whether it be beautiful. Or haunting. Or dark. Or satirical. It's all good. Amazingly good!\n\n\n\nLiminal Dronescape 5 | Winter, is truly a lovely, hour + ethereal journey. Enjoy!\n\n\n\nOriginally released June 9, 2017\n\n\n\nArtwork - Studio\n\nCousin Silas: All compositions, music and performance",

His moods and atmospheres, well, I just latched onto them straight away. The feeling and impression of isolation, abandoned places and how technology can either help or hinder and the hidden cyphers of modern life.\n\n\n\nThis re-release has been remastered and comes with fairly long form bonus track. I do hope you enjoy.",

My wife and I were going through some very old slides that belonged to her late father and transferring them to digital images. This one, I came across again, purely by chance and felt it captured Melting Static rather nicely.\n\nI guess it's a 'found' image, and whilst it will have been taken by my wife's father, neither of us have any idea as to why we kept it.. Glad we did.",

This is the first release of a Remastered version\n\n\n\nThe rest of the album (Other Tales) apart from all being remastered, is a collection of edited/remixed and original material that may have been used in other projects with a different title... some not. I honestly have lost any recollection of what, where and why. They are all very early ones, and I was, you could say, learning my craft! Hence the album being available for free. \n\n\n\nMy sincere thanks to Glenn Sogge for the remastering, and Kevin Lyons for the rather tasty photo.",

Hope some of the tracks work for you.",

      "about": "Despite the fact that I am on many netlabels. This is the first to be released on my own, new netlabel.\n\n\n\nMost of the tracks on here were written during a wonderful friend's illness. Sadly she never fully recovered and passed away, leaving lots of people stunned and saddened. She was a great person to know, and she will remain in my thoughts and in my music for a long time.",
