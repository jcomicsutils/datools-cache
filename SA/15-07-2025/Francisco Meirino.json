      "about": "Testimony to the first encounter of the trio during a concert given at the cave12 on 28.10.2020, on the same evening of the new Covid announcements which brought on a re-confinement in France, and even to a six-month-long shutdown of cultural places in Switzerland. A concert from which we emerged staggering and with burning ears due to the ongoing crisis surrounding us. \n\nA masterful sonic performance. \n\nBefore silence.\n\n\n\n Drawing from the dense and intense sound material of the evening, Francisco Meirino carried out a work of mixing and cutting, thus releasing an account of it, conceived for vinyl support and domestic use, an auditory result with a fascinating tension/frame.\n\n\n\n Swirling field recordings, urban/mechanical sounds, ghostly radio, cannibal revoxian magnetic tape, unrecognizable saxophone chants from hell, and synthesizer manipulations, intermingle and merge into a sonic flow of pure permanent tension. An uncompromising and hallucinating sound journey of the very first order. A captivating back-and-forth, rich and spiraling between different levels of listening, filled with recognizable or unrecognizable sound materials and disturbing textures à la perfectly mastered dynamics, on a knife edge of abyss & time. \n\nAnd with, on the album, a simply gargantuan, corrosive, and overwhelming B-side!\n\n\n\nreleased April 24, 2022\n\n\n\nC12 A 08\n\n\n\nAntoine Chessex: Tenor saxophone, amplifier, electronics\n\nFrancisco Meirino: Modular synthesizer, contact microphone, and transducer\n\nJérôme Noetinger: Revox B77, electronics\n\n\n\nLive recording on 28.10.2020 at cave12\n\nSound engineering: Benjamin Ephise\n\nEditing and mastering: Francisco Meirino\n\nCut: Frédéric Alstadt at Studio Angström\n\nCover design: Xavier Robel + David Mamie\n\n\n\nProduction: cave12",

      "about": "A Perpetual Host is Francisco Meirino’s fourth full-length, solo studio album on Misanthropic Agenda.\n\n\n\nA deep dive into personal loss and the banalities of life and art, A Perpetual Host captures the raw, solitary, and often acerbic extremes that drive creation. Across four pieces, Meirino explores sonic tension and boredom, questioning the simplicity and complexity of the mundane with bursts of clarity that redefine existence itself.\n\n\n\nFrancisco Meirino is a Spanish sound artist based in Switzerland.\n\n\n\nHis music explores the tension between programmable material and the potential for its failure. His interest lies primarily in what is not supposed to be recorded : the end of life of electronic devices, electrostatic noise, magnetic fields and the unconventional use of music hardware and sound systems and how to exploit these sonic failures in radically different ways in his sound pieces.\n\n\n\nHis music combines intricate textures, sonic precision, wide spatial panning and is fascinating by its physical intensity and detail precision.\n\n\n\nHe mostly uses the modular synthesizer (Eurorack-Serge), various microphones, the computer, the field recorder, tape recorders and tape echoes, EMF detectors and various home-made electro-acoustic devices.\n\n\n\nNORTH AND SOUTH AMERICANS PLEASE PURCHASE HERE: \n\nmisanthropicagenda.bandcamp.com/album/francisco-meirino-a-perpetual-host",

His interest lies primarily in what is not supposed to be recorded : the end of life of electronic devices, electrostatic noise, magnetic fields and the unconventional use of music hardware and sound systems and how to exploit these sonic failures in radically different ways in his sound pieces. His music combines intricate textures, sonic precision, wide spatial panning and is fascinating by its physical intensity and detail precision. \n\n\n\nBorn April 1966, in Marseille, Jérôme Noetinger discovered experimental music under the influence of the Déficit Des Années Antérieures in Caen. He is a composer/improviser/sound artist working with electroacoustic devices. Composing sometimes musique concrete in the studio, and performing improvised music using electroacoustic devices such as: the reel to reel tape recorder Revox B77 and magnetic tape, analogue synthesizers, mixing desks, speakers, microphones, various electronic household objects and home-made electronica. Performing both solo and in ensembles, and collaborating often, and touring extensively internationally. Jerome also used to be the director of Metamkine, a non-profit organisation dedicated to the distribution of improvised and electroacoustic music until 2018.\n\nThe music on this CD was recorded by the duo in 2019 in Switzerland.\n\n\n\n--- french ---\n\n\n\nFrancisco Meirino est un artiste sonore basé en Suisse. Sa musique explore la tension entre le matériel programmable et le potentiel de son échec. Il s'intéresse principalement à ce qui n'est pas censé être enregistré : la fin de vie des appareils électroniques, les bruits électrostatiques, les champs magnétiques et l'utilisation non conventionnelle du matériel musical et des systèmes de sonorisation, ainsi qu'à la manière d'exploiter ces défaillances sonores de façon radicalement différente dans ses pièces sonores. Sa musique combine des textures complexes, une précision sonore, un large panoramique spatial et est fascinante par son intensité physique et la précision de ses détails. \n\n\n\nJérôme Noetinger découvre la musique expérimentale sous l'influence du Déficit des Années Antérieures à Caen. Il est compositeur/improvisateur/artiste sonore et travaille avec des dispositifs électroacoustiques. Il compose parfois de la musique concrète en studio et joue de la musique improvisée en utilisant des appareils électroacoustiques tels que le magnétophone Revox B77 et la bande magnétique, des synthétiseurs analogiques, des tables de mixage, des haut-parleurs, des microphones, divers objets électroniques ménagers et de l'électronique artisanale. Il se produit en solo et en groupe, collabore souvent et effectue de nombreuses tournées internationales. Il a également été directeur de Metamkine, une organisation à but non lucratif dédiée à la distribution de musique improvisée et électroacoustique jusqu'en 2018.\n\nLa musique de ce CD a été enregistrée par le duo en 2019 en Suisse.",

      "about": "In 2019, the swiss power-acoustic musician Francisco merino presented 'a new instability' a commission for the venerable ina-grm in Paris. of course, this institution is the pre-eminent center for the research and study of electro-acoustic music dating back to founding of groupe de recherches musicales in 1958 by Pierre Schaeffer. to this day, ina-GRM continues to be at the avant garde of the electro-acoustic composition, and it is quite an accomplishment and very appropriate for Meirino to receive such a commission.\n\n\n\nThis recording for 'a new instability' condenses the 32-channel original piece down to a still very active stereo version. here, Meirino continues to amplify and refine his compositions that walk a fine tightrope between raw expressivity of brutalist noise and conceptual rigor of more academic pursuits. such a work ranks him in with the likes of Zbigniew Karkowski, Dave Phillips, Puce Mary, and Illusion Of Safety.\n\n\n\nField recordings from a martial arts dojo in his hometown of Lausanne cast a pugilistic, combative arch to these recordings which snap, burst, explode, and erupt with utterances of men and women engaged in hand-to-hand combat. seering frequencies build, swarm, and amass out of these episodes rise to a psychologically tense crescendo that rupture at their heights, quickly turning attention towards a violence that originates from within. it is as if the objective observations of those martial arts recordings are sublimated within a subjective experience of psychic unease, disquiet, and imbalance.\n\n\n\n'A New Instability' is another magnificent chapter in the ongoing body of work for this accomplished composer of electro-acoustic noise. \n\n\n\nphotography by Francisco Meirino\n\ndesign by Jim Haynes\n\nmastering by James Plotkin",

      "about": "Untreated recordings from on-site testimonials archives.\n\nAssembled and mastered at Shiver Mobile 2013.\n\n-Francisco Meirino\n\n\n\nPreviously released (digital only) by Impulsive habitat in 2013",
      "credits": "released January 1, 2013\n            \n            REVIEW on DECODER\n\n\n\nIt would feel strange to describe an album of field recordings without mentioning its context, so let’s start there. Francisco Meirino, who lives in Switzerland and has been experimenting with sound for two decades, compiled Knowing More How than Why from recordings in locations as far-flung as Ourense, Spain and Osaka, Japan. He released the album through Impulsive Habitat, a label that houses an international collective of field recording artists and makes all of its albums available for free. If you browse through the label’s archive, you’ll find a staggering range of soundscapes: lightning strikes in Norway, a political demonstration in Italy, a factory in Australia, a train station in Kansas. And throughout Impulsive Habitat’s catalogue appears an uneasy fascination with the tension between human society and the rest of nature.\n\n\n\nThat unease is all over Knowing. This isn’t just experimental music — this is experimental eco-acoustics. Most pieces don’t top the four minute mark, and the unnerving shifts in dynamics from track to track make me feel like I’ve stumbled on a collection of outtakes from a new Scott Walker project. “Mouth Candy,” which I’m guessing is a recording of Pop Rocks dropped in water, sounds surprisingly serene given that Pop Rocks are among the most bizarre and unsettling candies ever made. “Ventilation System of a Mall’s Toilet,” though, would probably scare me out of my wits if Meirino didn’t name the sound source in the track title (and if it were late enough in the night). Even though we’re hearing sounds that represent fixed places and moments, we’re hearing them radically out of context, and Meirino never lets us forget that.\n\n\n\nAt this point it’s probably healthy to ask a couple of questions: Why listen to compositions with titles like “Pasta in Tomato Sauce” or “Citric Acid on an Open Circuit”? Why write or talk about field recordings, especially ones like Meirino has given us? Here’s my answer: these compositions and Meirino’s arrangement of them force us to step back and consider not only music in isolation (assuming perfect speakers and headphones), but sound in general as it seeps into our daily lives from all sides.\n\n\n\nPhil Benson, the singer for the excellent Bay Area punk group Terry Malts, recently told me about a time he heard Joy Division’s “She’s Lost Control” in a bar. He had listened to the song a million times before, but in that context (there’s that word again) the song sounded incredible in a completely new way. Knowing plays with the same logic and uses it to study modern machinery. The tracks either de-familiarize us from the sounds of technology in daily life or are recordings of technologies being altered in creative ways (“Burning a Reel Tape Loop,” “Defect Oscillator,” “Reel-to-Reel Static Mess”).\n\n\n\nSo it’s perfect that, on both of the album’s bookending tracks, you can hear pop songs in the background. On the closer, “Waiting for My Okonomiyaki,” anodyne restaurant music drowns under the weight of dinnertime conversation and the sounds of cooking. And near the end of “Cleaning Machine,” the opener and my favorite track on Knowing, a catchy R&B song bleeds through industrial noise. Even in such a clean place as the track title describes, the R&B is far from sterile. It has become part of its environment. We hear it as we hear easy listening radio in the supermarket, or as we hear dance music blasting from a nearby building on a Saturday night. It interacts with the world, and the world transforms it into something new. So who cares about buying immaculate speakers and headphones in a fight to hear our music as purely as possible? The sleepless electric world is humming all around us. If we listen closely, we might hear ourselves.\n\n-Emmerich Anklam",

Mutual respect? The obvious punk drive of Noisendo001 is more subtle in 002 but it is present in the nervous breathing of the acoustic and synthetic sounds that excite our senses while listening to this record. \n\n\n\nThe title - 'Shell-Shocked' - may suggest a sonic assault, but what happens, even if it's not an example of good behaviour, sounds friendly for the uninitiated as long as they're in love with the art of sounds and not only with 'music'. It's an old debate. Improvisation seems to have an important role, the unrepeatable 'occurrence' or 'event', forever lost if not recorded. Sometimes you can hear some sort of orchestra rehearsal in which strings, in particular, are trying to find the right tuning, but what is left is provoked out of tune sound, a sonic freedom, ok, but also a tonic for the brain somehow fed up with organisation and 'neat' things.",

      "about": "Review by Chris Whitehead\n\n\n\nThe first release on Takanobu Hoshino’s OtO label, is quite a startling and daring launch. The Fukushima based sound artist has chosen Francisco Meirino to kick start his new venture with an album of stark beauty and purity. It requires a deep listening approach. I know that term is a bit of a cliché these days, but this time I think it is truly valid. This work simply will not reveal the truth at its core without respecting its subtlety.\n\n\n\nAs soon as ‘Undetected’ arrived through the post I couldn’t wait to hear it, so I slid it into the car CD player to listen to on the half hour drive to work. For a collection as subtle and nuanced as this, trying to appreciate the detail and peripheral disturbances involved proved unfruitful whilst motoring. During one particularly quiet spell I forgot I had I had a CD on at all, there was just the noise of the car’s engine until a sudden thump led me to momentarily think the exhaust had fallen off. It was actually an unidentified loud bang recorded in Meirino’s back yard.\n\n\n\nI would suggest that this release requires some preparation before listening. Firstly the environment needs to be pretty silent, preferably dark to avoid visual distractions and obviously the listener needs to be comfortable. Headphones are essential. Ideally Francisco Meirino likes to play live in total darkness, and maybe we should follow his example. Some of the sounds revealed here are on the very cusp of audibility, and yet they are essential to the whole.\n\n\n\n‘Undetected’ presents sixteen recordings from Meirino’s archives in an unadulterated form. They appear to be the sort of components from which he often constructs his tracks, but in this instance no composition takes place. Like the parts of an engine laid out on a workbench, Meirino invites us to examine these pure and unadorned sonic objects as they sit there in the cold light of day.\n\n\n\nThe first track follows a gently fizzing oscillator through its death throes. After two minutes of undulating static the device suddenly blinks out of existence forever with an impressive final burst. This sets the tone for what is to come: The sound of carbonic acid decomposing in water via a hydrophone, crisp and sharp: An unknown recording from a lost archive featuring drum rolls of charged pulses: A manhole on a construction site and strong wind on scaffolding. Sounds that in turn explore open spaces, manmade interiors and microscopic events within circuits and machines.\n\n\n\nThree separate pieces are concerned with ultrasonic discharges in voltage circuits captured using electromagnetic field detectors. Like tiny stars punctuating the blackness of empty space, flickers of electricity momentarily flare into existence, only to die away in an instant. This practice reminds me of the Dark Matter search experiments carried out in a 1100 metre deep potash mine close to where I live. The depth of rock cuts out cosmic rays by a factor of 1 million allowing for ultra low background particle detection.\n\n\n\nTwo variations on the subject of falling snow (one of snow falling on a metal plate and one of it falling onto itself) provide a physical counterpoint to the ultrasonic discharges. Similar in the sense that they record points of sound set against a silent background, continuity is maintained. The sequencing of these selections is important. Listening to the tracks as they occur in order provides the best way into this secret world.\n\n\n\n‘Reel to Reel Motor and Voltage Discharges’, gleaned from a tape recorder with belt and high density ground problems, begins with high pitched crackling and a thin sustained buzz before a deep throbbing bass sound underpins everything. Meirino’s fascination with malfunctioning machinery and failing systems seems to bleed into everything he does.\n\n\n\nThe disc closes with a loud, multichannel examination of a hospital’s ventilation system , rattling machine noise and churning turbines forming a deeply mechanical finale to a superb and hugely rewarding release. ‘Undetected’ delivers more secret pleasures with each exploration of its hidden undercurrents.",

A true union between coarse substance of analogical devices and voltage of tense electronics. \n\nThe core of Beyond Repair is the fusion of its contrasts. \n\nPermanent tension between chiselling and bare deconstruction, meditation and frontal sound, cold stasis and unstable dynamics.\n\n\n\nEleven tracks that run without pause as a single composition that hits like a strong cut-up aggression. \n\nAn active fragments path irreparable, almost elusive but real sharp in his objectivity. \n\nRuns fast and affects the listener on an intuitive level as flashes. A set which stops roughly and leaves the feeling of intuition. It does not reveal, but it makes his little lighting.",
