      "about": "The baritone guitar is a guitar with a longer scale length, typically a larger body, and is tuned lower than a regular guitar - often pitched halfway between the lowest note of a bass and and the lowest note of a regular guitar. \n\n\n\nHenry Kaiser has been playing baritone guitars for over 30 years and this is his first solo album that is all baritone. All solos here are free-improvised, live, in real time. Various extended techniques, both manual and electronic, are employed to create rich polyphonic and orchestral textures. Many of Kaiser's musical heroes: Terry Riley, Cecil Taylor, Derek Bailey, Fred Frith, Iannis Xenakis, Conlon Nancarrow, Barry Guy, Rakotozafy, D'Gary, Evan Parker, and Gyorgi Ligeti provided direct inspiration for the solos on this album. \n\n\n\nThe title track features a lyric that was written as a poem by Adelaide Anne Procter called A Lost Chord, published in 1860 in The English Woman's Journal. The final track is a baritone guitar variation on Jimmy Durante's parody of that poem from the 1947 film This Time for Keeps.\n\n\n\nThe various baritone guitars employed on this album were from these luthiers: Versoul, Downes, Ralph Bown, Beardsell, Spalt/Totem, Jerry Jones, and Larry Pogreba.",

      "about": "\"The early 1980’s was a truly exciting time for those of us who were witnessing the beginning of the Downtown Scene. When Fred Frith (ex-Henry Cow) moved here in 1979, he started working with John Zorn, Eugene Chadbourne & Tom Cora, musicians I hadn’t heard of before but would soon come to admire and become friends with. With a few years, I discovered dozen of early Downtowners: Wayne Horvitz, Robin Holcomb, Polly Bradfield, Elliott Sharp, Zeena Parkins, Henry Kaiser & members of ROVA (both from the Bay Area) and many more. A number of international players also showed up around this time as well: Derek Bailey, Evan Parker, Hans Reichel, the East/West German Quartet and a young trumpeter named Toshinori Kondo. Fred Frith, a longtime hero of mine, put together a series of ensembles like Massacre, Mad World Music & Skeleton Crew and worked with Material & Curlew. Japanese trumpeter, Toshinori Kondo, stood out since he was filled with the crazed creative energy, playing some of the most intense trumpet ever, dancing or contorting his body while playing and was filled with strange surprises. I remember him playing a solo with Mad World Music while wearing a three foot tall dunce cap, eventually taking off the dunce cap, cutting off the top and shoving the dunce cap in the mouth of his trumpet to finish the solo. Too much!\n\n\n\nWith the passing of Mr. Kondo in October of 2020, Mr. Kaiser has put together a collection of improvisations from a long period: 1978 to 2020. It turns out that Henry Kaiser and Toshinori Kondo’s musical relationship goes back even further than when I first heard both of them playing together in the early 1980’s. This disc is a collection of duos and trios and it is not in chronological order, giving us a chance to hear the these musicians play during different periods of their long music journey. This disc begins with a more recent long duo with Kondo & Kaiser from 2016. Word is that Mr. Kondo had lip problems due to playing so intensely for so many years and ended up playing in his middle register and using electronics to enhance his sound. He has done recordings which feature his electronics (like ’Nerve Tripper’ on DIW from 2002). On the first piece, “The Light in the Shade”, Kondo is playing long, sustained notes with subtle electronics while Kaiser plays some equally skeletal, ghost-like guitar. The effect is most haunting like entering slowly moving shimmering dreamworld. Both Kondo and Kaiser create heavenly, somewhat angelic sound which recalls when angels are playing harp in the heavens. Kaiser eventually floats in with a distinctive psych sustain guitar freak-out which is played with some restraint, the blend between both players is just right. There are three relatively short duos with Kaiser and Kondo from 1978 up next. What is interesting is this: although both musicians have evolved over much over 40 years, the way they play, the way they shape the sounds they make are similar in overall sound or effect: concentrating on every note or sound. The first trio piece is from Greg Goodman (keyboard), Kaiser and Kondo and it is live from 1980. It sounds like Mr. Goodman is playing an organ and the sound is most spooky. At times it is hard to tell the guitar from the organ although I do recognize certain signature sounds that Mr. Kaiser made when I first heard him around the same time. Mr. Kondo is already a master of strange and wondrous sounds, bending & twisting his notes in ways which are completely unique. Midway, Mr. Kaiser takes an extraordinary solo here while Mr. Goodman casts off some waves of free/jazz piano weirdness and Kondo interjects his own daredevil note bursts. The second duo features Kaiser, Kondo & John Oswald live in Toronto in 1979. The same trio had a rare album released the previous year in 1978. Both Mr. Oswald on alto sax and Mr. Kondo are trumpets, are already young masters of extended technique sounds, with some strong acoustic/organic interplay going on while Mr. Kaiser also interjects his own unique sounds into the mix. The final duo of Kaiser and Kondo is from 2020, the year that Kondo passed away. Again, we can hear the close language that has evolved between these two elders over the many years. This entire disc is 79+ minutes long and an incredible display of international free/improv at its best.\"\n\n\n\n- Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG",

      "about": "The three leaders, on AT ONE TIME, Henry Kaiser, John Oswald, and Paul Plimley, have all worked with Cecil Taylor, both in performance and in workshops. Here, they share their love of the late master Taylor’s music with a celebration of language and narrative strategies that were discovered/pioneered by the great piano maestro. Two special guests join them to make quartets on two tracks. Scott Amendola joins in on drums and Tracy Sliverman brings his 6-string electric fiddle to the party. Unusually, pianist Paul Plimley chose to entire play vibes on this album. Oswald plays alto sax, as is usual. Kaiser plays electric and acoustic guitars + electric bass. Kaiser, Oswald, and Plimley have been collaborating together for well more than 40 years; this project is also a celebration of their friendship and love of improvising together, recorded during tough COVID times.\n\n\n\n“The first piece, ‘anagram ritz rewarding,’ has a calm vibe at the center although there is some strong, intense, circular interplay. Things pick up becoming more intense on ‘oceans felons salad’ when Mr. Kaiser switches to his signature electric guitar w/ that bent-tone/sustained/psych-like sound. Mr. Plimley is a thoughtful vibes player, often taking his time to counter-balance the more frenzied extrapolations by Kaiser and Oswald. Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Oswald have obviously worked together for many years as we can hear them connecting on different levels no matter how far out they go. John Oswald, who is a longtime member CCMC (with Michael Snow) and is also known as ‘Plunderphonics’, is a great free saxist who rarely seems to record. Oswald is in extremely fine form here and is digging deeply into diverse vocabulary. There are some great moments of hair-raising intensity when all three players let go and push things into the stratosphere. On the final piece, the trio are joined by ace drummer Scott Amendola who adds a strong percussive undertow while Mr. Kaiser appears to be playing some impressive electric bass. Things really take off here especially the frenzied vibes-work by Paul Plimley. This entire disc is a powerful concoction of focused free/spirit music at its best.” - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG",

      "about": "Let’s not claim that the performers on Two Views of Steve Lacy’s The Wire are making history. No matter how fine the music is here, it’s still a re-imagining of an historic moment: that time when the American composer and soprano saxophonist Steve Lacy went into a Tokyo recording studio with some freshly made Japanese friends, where they recorded a lost classic.\n\n\n\nLacy’s 1977 album The Wire was groundbreaking; this is merely magnificent.\n\n\n\nBut what saxophonist Bruce Ackley, percussionist Andrea Centazzo, pianist Tania Chen, cellist Danielle DeGruttola, and bassists Henry Kaiser and Michael Manring are doing with their tribute is effectively curating history. With this reprise of The Wire, now a hard-to-find and expensive (currently $500 for an LP copy) collector’s item, they’re doing their part to ensure that their mentor, inspiration, and friend does not get lost as memories fade, CDs lose their metallic sheen, and vinyl records accumulate dust.\n\n\n\nAs Kaiser notes: “Steve Lacy must never be forgotten. His contributions to the music are humongous and multiplex.\"\n\n\n\nGranted, Lacy—who died in 2004 but would have been 90 this year—is assured at least a small place in jazz legend. Sometime in the late 1950s he showed a rising-star tenor saxophonist that their instruments could be played using the same fingering. John Coltrane went out and bought a soprano sax, and a few months later “My Favourite Things” turned him into an international sensation and afforded him a base for his ever-more-radical explorations.\n\n\n\nLacy also devoted his 1958 album Reflections to the music of Thelonious Monk, the first time that the great pianist was so honoured. At the time of its release, ‘Monk was widely seen as an out-there anomaly rather than the Bach of jazz, and Reflections met with limited success. Now, of course, it seems prescient.\n\n\n\nThere are other aspects of the saxophonist’s life that are in danger of being forgotten, including his own considerable compositional gifts, which drew on Monk’s asymmetrical phrasing and broken rhythms. His body of work remains a largely untapped resource for today’s improvisers and interpreters—but not for Ackley, who studied and collaborated with Lacy for decades. In fact, Two Views of Steve Lacy’s The Wire is the Rova Saxophone Quartet mainstay’s second major Lacy project. Together with Kaiser, electronic musician Kyle Bruckmann, and his Rova bandmates, Ackley tackled Lacy’s suite for improvisers, Saxophone Special, for the Clean Feed label in 2017.\n\n\n\n“Key to the success of a  tribute….in  which we revisit our heroes’ works is speaking with an authentic, original and spontaneous voice, and at the same time embracing the source of inspiration,” Ackley said about the Saxophone Special Revisted sessions. “Also important is the innate design of the tribute work to be explored, and the approach the interpreters take to realizing it.”\n\n\n\nWith Lacy, part of that “innate design” is surprise—for the composer, for the performers, and for the listeners—and one of his strategies was to use unconventional instrumental combinations and unfamiliar collaborators. Saxophone Special saw Lacy working with an all-star cast of Europeans; The Wire, as noted, involved their Japanese counterparts. Throughout his life, the peripatetic Lacy—who was born in New York City but spent extended periods in the Bay Area, Vancouver, Rome, and Paris—acted as a kind of emissary for the American jazz avant-garde, spreading new thoughts about improvisation world-wide and bringing others back home.\n\n\n\nThe Italian-born Centazzo, who made a number of scintillating duo and trio recordings with the saxophonist, speaks to Lacy’s role as a mentor and inspirational sparkplug.\n\n\n\n“I remember vividly the first time I met him in Milan for an afternoon rehearsal,” he told journalist Mariana Velichkova in 2009. “I was used to following the rules rigidly, being the sideman and reading a score. So before we could start since we had no scores, nor did I know what we were going to play, I timidly asked ‘Steve, what do you want me to do?’ And he looked at me and placidly said: ‘PLAY WHAT YOU FEEL!’ I never forgot that moment.”\n\n\n\nLacy’s generosity extended to his compositional strategies. His written scores are generally spare indications of melody; sometimes accompanied by specific performance instructions or dedicated to a specific person, but even then they’re left open to personal interpretation. “All my pieces are dedicated, but I don’t always say it,” he told the Dutch saxophonist Jorrit Dijkstra in the early 2000s. “That blocks the listening if you have too many things in mind.”\n\n\n\nThat’s why Two Views of Steve Lacy’s The Wire includes two separate renditions of Lacy’s score. The written parts set out the general parameters of the work’s six segments, but leave room for spontaneous small-group interplay, for sudden departures from the plan, for the feeling in the room, even for the unspoken influence of mood and weather.\n\n\n\nLacy was deeply serious about the necessity of “playing what you feel”, and that’s felt here in another surprising way. When Ackley and Kaiser decided to replicate the instrumentation of the 1975 The Wire sessions, they made one small change: swapping in electric bass guitars for the acoustic upright basses of the original. This posed an intriguing artistic challenge: Kaiser is not really a bassist, while Manring is one of the most accomplished working today. How would they fit together?\n\n\n\nJust fine, it turns out. By playing what they feel, and because what they feel includes a deep love of Lacy’s inspiration, their low-frequency conversation extends outward to the entire group and the whole picture resonates with love, joy, ferocity, and mutual respect. Lacy’s own ensembles always embodied those qualities, and in this he remains a contemporary inspiration even 20 years after his passing.\n\n\n\nForgotten? Not likely.",

      "about": "The Super Power Trio of Amendola + Henry Kaiser + Michael Manring spent much of the Spring and Summer of 2023 traveling to alternate timelines and different Earths. Picking up work where they could, they created soundtracks for quite a number of films that do not exist in our homeworld version of the Earth’s infinite timelines. On this double album of surprising and inventive trio music they share pieces from fifteen of the films that they had composed and improvised sonic narratives for.\n\n\n\nFor Scott Amendola, the drum kit isn’t so much an instrument as a musical portal. As an ambitious composer, savvy bandleader, electronics explorer, first-call accompanist and capaciously creative foil for some of the world’s most inventive musicians, Amendola applies his wide-ranging rhythmic virtuosity to a vast array of settings. His closest musical associates include guitarists Charlie Hunter, Nels Cline, and Jeff Parker, Hammond B-3 organist Wil Blades, violinist Jenny Scheinman, saxophonist Phillip Greenlief, clarinetist Ben Goldberg, bassists Trevor Dunn, and Todd Sickafoose, players who have each forged a singular path within and beyond the realm of jazz.\n\n\n\nGuitarist Henry Kaiser operates in a multiplicity of musical genres and idioms. Free Improv, Jazz, Fusion, Rock, Contemporary Composition, World Music, and Blues are a few of the genres that he jumps between in his four-hundred-plus album discography. Kaiser is always trying to extend his guitars into novel and undiscovered areas of musical expression and collaboration.\n\n\n\nHailed by many as the world’s leading solo bassist, Michael Manring has been pushing back the boundaries of what’s possible on the bass guitar for decades. While his technical skill and innovations always make an impression, it is his ability to communicate on a profound emotional level that most touches listeners. As editor Tom Darter wrote in Keyboard magazine after seeing one of Michael's solo concerts, \"Forget his astounding technique and musicality; forget his absolute command of his instruments; forget how seamlessly the musical ideas and the performance of them were wedded together...The enlightenment came most from feeling (seeing, hearing) the joy Michael felt to be playing...his brand of transcendental chops and musical understanding...was all in the service of the final outcome, the joy of making music.”",

      "about": "Andrea Centazzo and Henry Kaiser have been playing percussion/guitar duets for over 42 years; since the dawn of free improvisation in America. This album celebrates their collaboration with new recordings from 2019 and 2017 next to their complete first recordings from 1978 that were first released on PROTOCOL, also on the Metalanguage label. Unpredictable and surprising, they continue to take no prisoners and to investigate new and unexplored musical territories. Electric and acoustic, they are to this day they are the cutting edges, gnawing away at boundaries of what has never been done before.\n\n\n\n“There is a fascinating balance/exchange of ideas going on here, an ongoing dialogue which each partner creates their own story or scenery, the other player moving within the flow. Mr. Kaiser alters the sound of his guitar on each piece, evoking a variety of vibes, genres or styles. Even when Mr. Kaiser switches to acoustic guitar, his playing is constantly evolving, reaching backwards and forwards as he goes. Mr. Kaiser sounds as if he is using an e-bow on his acoustic guitar to coax some mysterious drones in the second half… The music was/is consistently engaging. While listening, I kept thinking that I was entering a new space on each piece, the scenery in my mind’s eye unfolding and changing as we move along.” – Bruce lee Gallanter, DMG",

      "about": "More than 45 years ago, Henry Kaiser was one of the earliest adopters of studio rack effects to radically expand his guitars’ expressive capabilities. One inspiration behind this methodology was his love for solo improvisers whose live performances sounded like much more than a single musician. Terry Riley, Evan Parker, Cecil Taylor, and Derek Bailey were early masters of this. Equally inspiring to him were personal heroes of the post-WWII classical era: Gyorgi Ligeti, Conlon Nancarrow, Iannis Xenakis, Toru Takemitsu, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Giancinto Scelsi. Today in 2023, he is still inspired to use digital time-domain and pitch effects to make his guitars sound like things beyond what guitar has been before. Many of the tracks on this album exemplify the multiplicities of this approach to solo guitar. All tracks were recorded live with no overdubbing.",

      "about": "ANDREA CENTAZZO & HENRY KAISER - Above & Beyond Protocol (Metalanguage 9103/4; USA) Featuring Andrea Centazzo on percussion, malletkat & sampler and Henry Kaiser on electric & acoustic guitars. In November of 1978, Italian percussionist Andrea Centazzo came to New York and recorded with early members of the (soon-to-be-reckoned with) Downtown Scene: John Zorn, Eugene Chadbourne, Tom Cora, Polly Bradfield… Mr. Centazzo soon rented a van and drove across the US, working with a number up & coming musicians: Davey Williams & LaDonna Smith, Jack Wright, John Carter, Vinny Golia, members of Rova Sax Qt and guitarist Henry Kaiser. Mr. Centazzo soon started his own label (Ictus) to document his sessions in the US, as well as his evolving participation with many Italian and other European creative musicians. Mr. Centazzo eventually moved to L.A., where he still lives and renewed his collaborations with Dr. Chadbourne, John Zorn and Mr. Kaiser. \n\nThis fabulous 2 CD set features unreleased recordings from that initial trip in 1978, as well as two more recent sessions from 2017 and 2019. Both musicians have come a long way, their playing has evolved quite a bit over the 40+ years. Originally, Mr. Centazzo played mostly a drum kit (working with many other Italian avant-jazz grearts, but for more than a decade, Centazzo plays a large collection of gongs, timbales, assorted cymbals, electronic vibes (malletkat) and sampled percussion/sounds. Mr. Kaiser also has worked his way through a variety of devices for his electric guitar, eventually ending up with a rack of effects to choose from. The opening track, “Nostalgic Protocol”, seems to combine the old with the new, that early Downtown/insect-music improv sound with a more current free/improv exchange. There is a fascinating balance/exchange of ideas going on here, an ongoing dialogue which each partner creates their own story or scenery, the other player moving within the flow. Mr. Kaiser alters the sound of his guitar on each piece, evoking a variety of vibes, genres or styles. Even when Mr. Kaiser switches to acoustic guitar, his playing is constantly evolving, reaching backwards and forwards as he goes. Mr. Kaiser sounds as if he is using an e-bow on his acoustic guitar to coax some mysterious drones in the second half of the first disc. I found that although both discs are pretty long (75+ minutes each), the music was/is consistently engaging. While listening, I kept thinking that I was entering a new space on each piece, the scenery in my mind’s eye unfolding and changing as we move along. \n\nThen first disc comes from two session in 2107 & 2019. The second disc also features some 23 minutes of improvised duets from 1978, some 40 plus years ago and early in the music careers of both musicians. One of the things that stands out here is the way Mr. Kaiser keeps altering the sound of his guitar on each piece, consisting evoking a variety of sonic scenery which is often in flux as it shifts into another place. Mr. Kaiser is a master of effects which works well since Mr. Centazzo also keeps altering his sounds between acoustic percussion, cymbals, gongs and sampler. Hard to tell who is doing what at times. Back in 1978, both Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Centazzo, had less devices to utilize. Still, the overall sound and approach to free improv is intact. Perhaps less dense at times yet still superb. What it does remind me of is that early/Old School Downtown free sound which players like John Zorn, Eugene Chadbourne & Tom Cora, were developing when I first heard in in late 1979 and afterwards. This entire two disc set clocks in at 2 & 1/2 hours of music! Mr. Kaiser still knows how to give us more bang for our dollar(s). Dig in! - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG",

      "about": "PAUL PLIMLEY 1953-2022\n\n\n\nPaul was an amazing pianist; one of the greatest that I have ever been in the same room with. He had a strong connection to Cecil Taylor’s music. Paul studied with Taylor at the Creative Music Studio in 1978-79 and was the pianist on a Cecil Taylor record, playing on the orchestral LEGBA CROSSING in 1988.\n\n\n\nThe 40 or more albums that I have featuring Paul are always exciting and musically stimulating to listen to. He was an exceedingly special musician. I treasure my times playing with him.\n\n\n\nI first met Paul Plimley back in 1977 or 1978 in his home base sector of Vancouver, Canada. We played together over more than four decades, until Paul’s sudden death from cancer in May of 2022. We recorded the tracks for this PASSWORDS album in Berkeley, back in 1996 and 1997.\n\n\n\nSome of the other album projects that we recorded together were: \n\nWadada Leo Smith’s and my first YO MILES! project back in 1998, \n\nTHE STARBREAK SPLATTERLIGHT with Weasel Walter and Lukas Ligeti in 2010, and AT ONE TIME with John Oswald in 2021. The latter two may be found here on Bandcamp.\n\n\n\nI am so happy to have resurrected and remastered this out-of-print PASSWORDS album with Paul and Danielle, here on Bandcamp. I’ve re-sequenced it to Paul’s preferred sequencing and greatly improved the audio with modern mastering tech.\n\n\n\nPaul was one of those musicians who could create a telepathic connection with the musicians that he played with. That sort of live improvisation magic is definitely operating with the three of us here in PASSWORDS.\n\n\n\n-Henry Kaiser June 2022",

      "about": "In The Realm Of features a peculiar, rarely documented, and intense subgenre of improvisation endemic to the San Francisco Bay area, that might best be described as a combination of Cecil Taylor’s cell strategies plus interaction strategies quite similar to those developed by John Stevens and the SME. Another unusual feature of this recording is the guitarist Henry Kaiser here plays very electric 6-string bass. \n\nDrummer Spirit's long career as a percussionist spans from New York to Berkeley, working with with Julius Hemphill, Alan Shorter and the late bassist Jay Oliver in New York; and Butch and Wilbur Morris, Idris Ackamoor, Rasul Siddik, Prince Lasha and Oluyemi Thomas among many others in the Bay Area. Lately Spirit has been more shadow than presence, and we're happy to be able to shine the light on him in this rare recording. \n\nJoshua Marshall is an Oakland-based saxophonist and composer/improviser. His principal concerns are architectural innovation, narrativity, systematic improvisatory practice, and live digital media. He has studied under Roscoe Mitchell, Fred Frith, Pauline Oliveros, Zeena Parkins, Butch Rovan, I.M. Harjito, and Steve Adams of the ROVA Saxophone Quartet. \n\nJoshua Allen has created his own personal language on the tenor saxophone, with an emphasis on polytonal and asymmetrical phrasing, as well as extending the range and sonic ability of the instrument. He does this with constant emphasis and study of the overtone series, and the generation of multiphonics from the application of this process.",

      "about": "The background to this album has its roots in the year 1977 following their first releases; Brighton’s album Marsh Gas and Henry Kaiser’s Ice Death. Kaiser on hearing ‘Marsh Gas’ sent the album ‘Ice Death’ to Brighton and tried to arrange a meeting when he visited the UK later that year. However unfortunately that did not take place, and despite efforts, in the years before the Internet both parties lost contact with each other. It was re-established 40 years later when Chilean guitarist Gonzalo Fuentes was in the process of compiling an album call ‘Frets of Yore’ where both guitarists were asked to provide a contribution. Following contact, Kaiser asked Brighton to make a contribution to an album called ‘Friends and Heroes’ and in an associated press release stated his intent to make a duet album with him.\n\n\n\nThis is now been fulfilled by the release of ‘Together Apart’ in October 2017, recorded in Portsmouth Hampshire for Brighton, and for Kaiser, in Oakland California. After each session tracks were posted from one musician to another to add their contribution with the best being selected for the album. Kaiser mixed and mastered the final tracks.\n\n \n\nThe ideas behind the duets are varied, however in addition, it was agreed that each would make a solo recording that held a personal significance. Of those duets, some were intended to be thematic based upon previous experiences, while the remainder were directly interactive as if both musicians were sitting together in the same studio instead of thousands of miles apart, hence the title.\n\n\n\nOne of the thematic tracks ‘Cathedral Voices’ is intended to contain ripples of Brighton’s original track on ‘Marsh Gas’ entitled ‘The Chapel of Splintered Glass’ recorded in Chelmsford Cathedral. That track featured guitar, saxophonist Jim Livesey and the Sound in Brass hand-bell ringers and at the time of recording, captured the natural reverb of the Cathedral and its inherent delay to overlay sound on sound. For the current album it was agreed to try replicate something similar using two guitars. Despite best efforts to obtain use of the local cathedral, Brighton had to resort to recording techniques available within the studio at Portsmouth to try to obtain a similar sound and feel. Kaiser in tune with the concept created a background of moving sound replicating those that might be heard within a cathedral, hence the title. \n\n\n\nAnother ‘feature’ track is a dedication by both musicians to the one of the greatest improvising percussionists, Tony Oxley. Brighton had previously recorded with Oxley on the Incus album ‘February Papers’ in 1977 with one of the tracks entitled ‘Sounds of the Soil Pt 2’. The instruction at the time from Oxley to Brighton and Philipp Wachsmann, also on the original album, was for them to imagine that the soil was amplified and to try to conceive and produce sounds of the creatures that would crawl and scramble above and below.  The track called ‘Sounds of the Soil Pt 2 (revisited)’ is an attempt to recreate a similar feeling using two guitars with different sound stimuli.\n\n\n\nThe remaining tracks are a series of duets featuring Brighton using his Gibson ES 175 and Kaiser, a variety of stringed instruments including a harp guitar. The tracks have been created with combinations of acoustic and amplified instrumentation exploring the different aspects of timbres and levels of interaction between the two guitarists in an improvised scenario from different locations.",

      "about": "\"This is West Coast guitar great Henry Kaiser's eighth disc in less than two years and once more, he has continued to bestow us with another splendid gift. Each one of the previous discs has been completely different in sound and personnel and this one is equally astonishing!... [You Can't Get There From Here] begins with a calm, drifting, eastern sound. Mr. Manring's sublime fretless bass, subtle guqin (Chinese seven-string plucked instrument), mridangam (Indian drum) and Mr. Kaiser's dreamy psychedelic sustain guitar all blend together into a mesmerizing raga-like journey. When the wordless voice finally comes in, it also fits just right the way it often sounds in other raga-like pieces. Eventually, Mr. Kaiser takes a striking guitar solo which seems to go in two directions at once, forwards and backwards, without taking over the vibe. I love the way these pieces unfold in a most organic or natural way... The icing on the cake of course are a number of extraordinary solos from each member of the sextet, especially Mr. Kaiser who takes his time and knows exactly when to let the magic erupt.\" - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG",

      "about": "Historically speaking, many different sub-idioms and approaches to music have been nominated as SPACE MUSIC. A few of these landmarks would include: Sun Ra, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Gyorgi Ligeti, The Grateful Dead, Pink Floyd, The Forbidden Planet Soundtrack, New Age Music, Space Age Bachelor Pad, Sputnik-Telstar Pop Instrumentals, ECM, Krautrock, Brian Eno, Modern Electronic Music, Tape Music, etc. That list could go on and on. Here, three old friends reflect and rebound among those various touchstones and project themselves into new and unexplored sectors of Space Music. Chris and Henry have been playing together for over 40 years, and at the end of CD1 is one archival track of them playing their arrangement of Bela Bartok’s Violin Duo #36, transformed into cosmic guitar music. Many curious musical juxtapositions are to be found on this album, such as:  What would Derek Bailey, Sun Ra, and Randy California sound like playing together? What would Frank Zappa playing with Robert Fripp, and Don Buchla sound like? How about Keith Jarret playing with Pete Cosey, and Conlon Nancarrow at a guitar tribute to Ligeti? Or perhaps Perrey and Kingsley vs. Sonny Sharrock at the Disneyland Main Street Electrical Parade?  Everything here is in the spirit of all surprises, all fun, all the time. \n\n\n\nBOB BRALOVE was the MIDI wizard, producer (Infrared Roses, Built to Last), and co-writer of Gold and Platinum selling songs, including: Picasso Moon, Way to Go Home, Easy Answers, Parallelogram, Little Nemo in Nightland,  Sparrow Hawk Row, with the Grateful Dead for the last eight years of the long, strange trip.  Bralove, who has a Masters Degree in composition, studied with Pulitzer Prize winning composer, Wayne Peterson, focusing on composing orchestral and chamber  works.  He perfected his skills in the digital manipulation of sound, as the sound designer and computer music director for Stevie Wonder (Woman in Red, In Square Circle).  After an eight-year tenure with Stevie, he began working with the Grateful Dead.  His first project was to help score the CBS remake of the television series The Twilight Zone. In addition to his songwriting, producing and MIDI wizard activities for the band, Bralove is especially well known for his undeniable creative sound, performing and designing with the Grateful Dead, the mind-bending, avant-garde Drums and Space segments of their live shows. Bralove also performs his art work and music live across the U.S. and in Japan in solo concerts, with Dose Hermanos and The Psychedelic Keyboard Trio, and Henry Kaiser.\n\n\n\nHENRY KAISER Grammy winner Henry Kaiser is widely recognized as one of the most creative and innovative guitarists, improvisers, and producers in the fields of rock, jazz, world, and contemporary experimental musics. The California-based musician is one of the most extensively recorded as well, having appeared on more than 290 different albums and contributed to countless television and film soundtracks. Henry is also a scientific diver in the US ANTARCTIC PROGRAM.  He has more Antarctic under-the-ice footage in films and tv shows than any other underwater cameraman.  With eleven scientific diving deployments to McMurdo Station Antarctica, he probably has more dives under fast ice than any other professional videographer. The Antarctic reaches of Youtube are littered with his many short underwater videos shot under the ice of the Ross Sea.\n\n\n\nCHRIS MUIR has been embroiled in music, electronics, and computers for over forty years. He has been heavily involved in creating interactive music environments for much of that time. An accomplished musician and composer, he has been involved with many projects, in many genres. Recent projects include “Yo Miles!”, “Lunar Asylum” and “Zen Disaster”. In addition to his musical endeavors, he is required to propel balls for his dog, and he enjoys referring to himself in the third person.\n\n\n\nThe three departed pets depicted in the album art and also commemorated on the first three tracks, which are live solos without overdubs by each of the three players, are Gracie the dog and the two cats named Emma and Miso.",

      "about": "This album consists of 22 freely improvised solos on 18 different acoustic guitars. In the past 5 years, Henry Kaiser released seven solo discs that consist of long (70-80 minute) electric guitar solos. In this latest release, he explores the short solo guitar format, with solos wherein the mind of the listener can hold the beginning, middle, and end of the musical stories in one mentation. In the tradition of Derek Bailey's 1975 classic album IMPROVISATION on the Italian CRAMPS label, these solos are short virtuoso expressions of extended guitar language and technique. More significantly, they are expositions of many new approaches to musical narrative. Akin to short story format, as opposed to novels, the improvisations are concise, otherworldly, and surprisingly electric-sounding for being played on acoustic guitars. Imagine Henry Kaiser, Derek Bailey, Robert Peter Williams, Morton Feldman, Robbie Basho, Joseph Spence, Toru Takemitsu, Karlheinz Stockhausen, D'Gary, Teta, and Masayuki Takayanagi sitting around a campfire for a crazy acoustic guitar jamboree, that is then transfigured through a sonic-kaleidoscope, inter-dimensional, space warp, and you can begin to guess what this recording sounds like.",

      "about": "Leaps is an album of dramatic and colorful duo improvisations. Whether it’s the moody western slow wallow of “Door In The Light”, the patient and exploratory “Blinks and Blinks”, the quirky, popish, oddness of “The 14 Animals That Will Haunt Your Dreams”, or the “blues” influenced “Sproing”, we have found something special here. Don’t tread lightly…just leap right in. This first collaborative recording by two quirky and original masters of their instruments was recorded in an afternoon, and dramatically surprised both players, who had only performed together in larger groupings on a few rare occasions.\n\n\n\n\"Leaps featur[es] Scott Amendola on drums and percussion and Henry Kaiser on guitars. Bay area drummer, Scott Amendola is a longtime member of the Nels Cline Singers and performs/records Larry Ochs, Charlie Hunter & Ben Goldberg plus having several discs out as a leader. West Coast guitar great, Henry Kaiser, keeps busy by playing in a wide variety of contexts: solos, duos, trios and bands of different sizes. Mr. Kaiser has recorded a number duos, most often with fellow guitarists like: Derek Bailey, Eugene Chadbourne and Fred Frith, but rarely in a duo with a drummer. Each piece here is very different and shows many sides to these two gifted improvisers. The title piece is first and it is an epic length workout which goes throughout a number of different sections, moods or scenes. From rip-roaring intensity to those Dead-like space jams. It all fits together like fascinating cryptic mosaic or puzzle which unfolds as it evolves. This disc is around 75 minutes long and takes us on a fabulous journey throughout\". - Bruce Lee Gallanter, DMG",

      "about": "This absolutely unique musical collaboration places 4 musical luminaries of jazz and experimentalism into the musical maelstrom of Korean shamanism; interweaving with the musical cell structure approach of Cecil Taylor, the harmelodics of Ornette Coleman, the Carnatic classical tradition of Southern India, and the eclectic Afrological expressionism of the Agharta/Pangea electric period of Miles Davis.\n\n\n\nIn Korean musical tradition, a mudang is a type of shaman that has become possessed by a god, called a momju. Mudang perform fortune telling using their spiritual powers derived from their possession. They preside over a kut (rite) involving song and dance. The highly electric music on this album is directly inspired by the rhythms and Spirit of Korean shamanism. Henry Kaiser, Simon Barker, and Bill Laswell each have spent more than one-half of their musical lifetimes collaborating with Korean traditional musicians. They invited saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa to join them for this newly energized exploration of the musical unknown. The result is compelling, ecstatic, surprising, and kaleidoscopic.",

      "about": "Improvised music by 4 of the most celebrated titans of contemporary sonic innovation (Tania Chen, Henry Kaiser, Wadada Leo Smith and William Winant), Ocean of Storms incorporate elements of modern composition - both otherworldly and grounded in the American Roots Musics of jazz and blues. This recording grew out of the long-time music collaborations of Henry Kaiser and Wadada Leo Smith. The two first met 40 years ago when Wadada wrote a guitar duet for Kaiser and Eugene Chadbourne which appeared on Kaiser’s first solo album, Ice Death. The pair made 5 albums together over a 20 year period with their very popular YO MILES! project that celebrated and explored the mid-70’s electric music of Miles Davis, as well as other collaborative albums with Thomas Mapfumo, Bill Laswell, and others. For Oceans of Storms, they enlisted old pal William Winant, the master American New Music percussionist, and Tania Chen, the astounding British pianist. A day at legendary Fantasy Studios in Berkeley resulted in this oeuvre, one that runs the gamut from whisper-quiet acoustic music at the beginning, to a terrifying maelstrom of electric intensity on the final track. Ocean of Storms is a state-of-the-art recording and performance of 21st century improvisation. Elegance, humor, mystery, awe, and surprise intertwine in a cosmic musical braid created by 4 master musicians.",

      "about": "Like their namesake the 3-headed extraterrestrial planet-killing dragon, that was responsible for the destruction of the Venusian civilization and that began causing so much trouble for Godzilla and Mothra back in 1964, this trio trio comes from the Great Beyond with a mission of fiery improvisation and a protocol take no prisoners in the process. \n\nFeaturing Andrea Centazzo on percussion, Tania Chen on piano and Henry Kaiser on guitar. Italian percussionist/electronics wizard Andrea Centazzo has been collaborating with Kaiser, since 40 years ago in the late seventies. Mr. Kaiser and Mr. Centazzo have kept in touch through the years, recording a double duo LP with Toshinori Kondo in 1979, a duo CD for Ictus Records (Centazzo’s label) in 2007 and a Derek Bailey tribute CD in 2012.\n\n\n\nFor this new trio CD, Kaiser and Centazzo have added pianist Tania Chen, who has recorded with Kaiser on two discs in the last few years (OCEAN OF STORMS with Wadada Leo Smith) and another: MEGASONIC CHAPEL, that blended Korean Court Music and Shaman music with free improvisation. On Ghidorah they explore absolutely contemporary free improv strategies and all 3 players radically push the vocabulary and expression of their instruments beyond where they have gone before. Kaiser in particular discovered new forms and sounds of electric guitar expression during the recording of this album, like the continous creation that happens in some remote corner of the multi-verse where space monsters are born.",

      "about": "Immediately after returning from his 12th deployment to Antarctica as a Scientific Diver, Henry Kaiser recorded this musical translation of 43 scientific dives installing an underwater remote sensing system under the ice near McMurdo Station. Kaiser has previously released 7 CDs of music inspired by his years working on and beneath the ice. The live electric guitar solos here are, perhaps, his favorite among that series of releases.\n\n\n\nBeautiful, mysterious, complex, and surprising - the guitar playing mirrors what it is like to enter the alien world below the ice.  Kaiser received an Academy Award nomination for his production, cinematography and soundtrack work on Werner Herzog’s  ENCOUNTERS AT THE END OF THE WORLD, the documentary about people and science in the Antarctic. He knows from direct experience what he is playing about here.\n\n\n\nKaiser’s sub-surface explorations are fantastical, however much they are created in the mundane world. Each sonic incident has its counterpart below the ice, but not all of the guitarist's companions are his everyday scientific dive buddies. Imagine Conlon Nancarrow in a Day-Glo drysuit, Pete Cosey strapping on his midnight blue tanks, Robbie Basho with paisley fins, as Jerry Garcia gazes through a prismatic ice mask: Henry’s ghostly companions, on a mission to go deep and unreal.",

Kaiser's latest solo album continues his explorations of trance solo guitar inspired by Tromba. Also represented are a long form contemporary classical composition (in tribute to Giacinto Scelsi) and fuzz-rock trance guitar jam. This is the state-of-the-art in exploratory experimental guitar, while still retaining what Kaiser calls \"melody and grounding in what folks can actually stand to listen to\".\n\n\n\nCheck out the blazing \"Echoes for Sonny Sharrock\" (track 7) featuring trumpet legend Wadada Leo Smith.",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

Much in the tradition of the Canned Heat and the San Francisco psychedelic sound an all-star rhythm section paves the way for mind expansion via boogie with an outer limits guitar party that is both danceable and explosive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe album title is derived from one of the tracks on this release; Kaiser tells us a story about one time when he was hanging out with John Lee Hooker and he played some improvised recording by his dear friend Derek Bailey for Hooker, who in turn said something to the effect of, \"yeah but can he boogie\".... If anyone were to dare ask that question of Henry Kaiser, the answer can indubitably be found here.",

      "about": "Music for Werner Herzog's Encounters at the End of the World reunites two iconic guitar players and composers: Henry Kaiser and David Lindley. LIndley, who is well know for his work with Jackson Browne, has also worked with Ry Cooder, Linda Ronstadt and Bruce Springsteen to name a few, but his wonderfully eccentric side has clearly been encouraged here by Kaiser - as was also evidenced in their venture into Madagascar two decades ago which yielded their series of albums featuring contemporary music from the region.\n\n\n\nOn Encounters..., a soundtrack to Herzog's documentary about the lives of scientist living and working in Antarctica, Kaiser and Lindley collaborate once again to create something entirely new - an expansive raw landscape, dire isolation juxtaposed to unimaginable beauty and discovery that the film brings to light.\n\n\n\nKaiser plays acoustic and electric guitars, kabosy, ukelele, string and flute samples. Lindley plays weissenborn slide guitars, fiddle, hardanger fiddle, cumbus, oud and cittern. Additional performers include Cheryl Leonard (glass instrument)s, Damon Smith (double bass), William Winant (percussion), Danielle DeGruttolla (cello) and Jen Baker (trombone).",

      "about": "What Kaiser and Smith have demonstrated with the Yo Miles! project, above all, is that the jazz fusion idiom essentially created by Davis (with a little help from his early collaborators and some inspiration from rock and funk influences such as Jimi Hendrix and James Brown) was a great vehicle for creative playing, providing possibilities both for tight, funky ensemble work à la Brown and extended collaborative improvisations. Of course, musical second-raters subsequently rode jazz fusion into the ground, but the Yo Miles! cast demonstrates that the form itself is still vital when it's in the right hands. Kaiser and Smith shine, as usual. Smith, who was once dismissed as a cerebral jazz intellectual, is ebullient and expansive throughout.",

Featuring the no-holds-barred guitar mutilation of Henry Kaiser, the shocking drum spasms of cult hero Charles K. Noyes (Toy Killers) and the subterranean bass filth of Weasel Walter (The Flying Luttenbachers, etc.), this intense studio session will undoubtedly horrify those yearning for sensitivity, texture, and space in music. What it does offer is repeated blows to the head, throwing stars to the gut and shameful kicks to the rear-end. Ninja Star Danger Rock is a post-apocalyptic sonic world filled with zombies, flying saucers, entropy, and destruction. You have been warned!",

The results are the digital-only Yo Miles: Lightning and Yo Miles: Shinjuku albums. Shinjuku takes four cuts from Sky Garden and augments them with a 25-minute previously unreleased live cut, \"Muhammed Ali.\"",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

      "about": "Featuring Henry Kaiser on electric & acoustic guitars and Bob Bralove on acoustic piano and synths. Both Henry Kaiser and Bob Bralove have worked with members of the Grateful Dead at different times. Henry has sat in with Phil Lesh & Friends and Mr. Bralove played live with The Dead for a number of years during the drums and/or space segments. Hence, both of these men know the power of psychedelic jamming. Right from the gitgo of \"Concrete Nebula\", those cosmic space/rock sounds and vibes are flowing. There is a strong give and take between both musicians, as well as an uplifting, transcendent wash of warm pastel colors. Even when both musicians play acoustic instruments, their sound is still quietly cosmic. When Henry switches to that fuzz/wah wah tone on \"Red Queen\", you just want it to go on forever. It sounds as if the duo is playing during a thunder storm on \"Heavenly Plaster\" and it fits just right. Mr. Bralove seems to favor his acoustic piano and uses his synth selectively to create moods or set the scenes of the journeys these men take us on. If any of you out there have a problem with the Dead, please forget any references that I made here since this music is still wonderful, engaging and transformative. In the olden days (of the seventies), one might call this space music or perhaps early krautrock. Either way, it is consistently mesmerizing. - Bruce Lee Gallanter, Downtown Music Gallery",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",

      "about": "Guitarist Henry Kaiser is a prolific member of the San Francisco Bay Area music scene, as well as being a globally recognized leader of the \"second generation\" free improvisers who came of age in the '70s. His earliest musical inspiration came from the spiky sounds of English improvising guitarist Derek Bailey and the many guitarists in Captain Beefheart's Magic Band; later on Kaiser absorbed the subtle string textures of the American blues stylists and traditional music of Asia, particularly India, Korea, and Vietnam. His initial recordings documented solo projects and spontaneous groupings with other energetic improvisers like Fred Frith, the ROVA Saxophone Quartet, pianist Greg Goodman, and vocalist Diamanda Galas. Kaiser's restless creativity unearthed many new and unconventional electric guitar techniques during these years, and he combined these innovations with a strong sense of logic and concise development, often aided by sophisticated sound-processing devices. During the Eighties, Kaiser projects tended toward the rock sound of the '60s and '70s, with a special fascination for the music of The Grateful Dead and particpation in a number of tribute albums for Imaginary Records. Just when people were starting to peg him as a \"cover artist\", Kaiser ditched his rock stylings, for the most part, and back to more of a free improvising style. He recorded albums with Derek Bailey and Jim O'Rourke, and did new recordings with his old duo-partner Fred Frith. The Nineties also saw Kaiser increase his profile through his successful collaborations with David Lindley and local musicians from both Madagascar and Norway. He was also involved with a number of recordings made in Burma, also for the Shanachie label.",
