      "about": "This is not music? Says who? Try to imagine an astonishing reversal of the traditional widespread subservience of sound to story-telling: instead of sound effects providing realism to a narrative, the open shell of an apparent narrative becoming sound work... or perhaps even a new form of weird experimental music that only requires a willingness to listen to the actual sonic matter itself, precisely when it appears to be something else.\n\n\n\n\n\nConceived and edited at ‘mobile messor’ (worldwide), 2009-2025.

      "about": "Unlike photo cameras or smartphones, handheld audio recorders are unknown and sort of bewildering to most people.\n\n\n\n01: Phnom Penh, Cambodia, March 2013. \n\nA gated hotel with gardens and security staff. Right before dawn I left a running handheld recorder in the adjacent room’s private seating area outdoors. When I came out in the morning, it was gone. The hotel management checked their security cameras and discovered that in fact one of the night guards surreptitiously took it and left with it. I eventually got it back and it had a recording of this event. While doing the rounds, this person had a first look at the recorder (from around 00:50 in the track), probably trying to figure out what it was, and certainly realizing it had some value. He left it in the same place but came back five minutes later, this time to grab it for good. He put it in his pocket and left the hotel, unintentionally stopping the recording during the handling, while going away on his moped.\n\n\n\n02: Barega, Sardinia, September 2017.\n\nA small rural country road in the middle of nowhere. Right before dusk I left a running handheld recorder hidden in the tall grass by the side of the road. When we came back to collect it a couple of hours later, it was gone. Describing the situation to the people of the rural accommodation where we were staying, they were baffled but remembered this solitary man who lived in a nearby isolated house and apparently walked his dog around there every day. We found the (rather creepy) house and, after quite some time knocking at the gate, hearing dog barking and some other noises in the dark, he came out and was startled to hear my story and see an exact replica of the strange device (I had an identical second recorder) that he had found and taken. So I got it back and it had a recording of this event. The dog had found it and the man took it (around 02:30 in the track), spending quite some time trying to figure out what it was, first outside, and then, with more dedication, back home. The dog also seemed quite interested in it. After a lot of handling –and probably plenty of head-scratching moments– he unintentionally stopped the recording.\n\n\n\nMastered at ‘Hundred Islands Studios’ (Rosclave enclave) in 2024.\n\n\n\nHeadphone listening recommended.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Barbara Ellison, who shared these episodes and helped with the rescues.\n\n\n\n(c) francisco lópez 2024 -  www.franciscolopez.net\n\n Immaterial release by nowhere [worldwide] 2024",

      "about": "Korean people are lively and loquacious in all social situations… except when they travel in their high-speed trains (‘KTX’), where they strictly follow, to an unparalleled extent, their unwritten etiquette of silence. This generates a magnificent unintended sonic interplay between enveloping broad-band machine sounds and a surrounding voiceless collective human presence, both of them with their own intricacies and hidden details.\n\n\n\nCreated from non-transformed original recordings of interior environments of high-speed trains across Korea. Recorded in 2023. Edited and mastered at ‘Hundred Islands Studios’ (Rosclave enclave) in 2024.\n\n\n\nHeadphone listening highly recommended.\n\n\n\nThanks to Barbara Ellison, Jin Sangtae and Susannah Tantemsapya.\n\n\n\n(c) francisco lópez 2024 -  www.franciscolopez.net\n\n Immaterial release by nowhere [worldwide] 2024",

Virtually all its audio content is completely inaudible through laptop, smart phone or equivalent small speakers or standard ear buds.

      "about": "Dynamo [original soundtrack]:\n\nCreated at ‘mobile messor’ (Los Angeles, Den Haag, Reykjavik, Dubai), 2020-2021.\n\nEdited and mastered at ‘Hundred Islands Studios’ (Rosclave enclave), 2022.\n\n\n\n------------\n\nDynamo is a large-scale suspended artwork specifically developed for the atrium of the Spanish Pavilion at Expo Dubai 2020. Created by Daniel Canogar in collaboration with composer / audio-artist Francisco López, and produced in cooperation with the Spanish Agency for the Promotion of Cultural Projects –AC/E, the artwork is composed of sculptural screens that form three interlaced loops. Surrounding the artwork is a spiralling ramp that descends to the lower level of the atrium and allows the public to contemplate the artwork from multiple vantage points. Built-in inside the walls at the upper level of the atrium there is a large-scale, multi-channel sound system arranged in a ring of sixteen concealed speakers that project sound into the space, in ever-changing sonic combinations triggered by the visual patterns from the screens.\n\n\n\nThe public can interact with the sculptural screens via an interactive system built into the ramp’s handrail: hands placed under the handrail’s sensors translate into animated sparks on the screens. The more the public activates the sensors, the more vibrant Dynamo’s visual and sonic content becomes. Mimicking the workings of an electromagnetic dynamo, the artwork eventually collects enough energy to generate a thundering experience that resonates through the atrium. This moment captures the intense roar of so many machines of the past echoing through our modern history –technologies that we behold with a mixture of fear and fascination. The ecstatic discharge is followed by a calmer phase evocative of the circulatory systems of living entities. This quieter mode gives way to a new cycle of gradual build-up, through an iterative repeating process of “collect and release” that is so much part of energy systems both biological and technological.\n\n\n\nDynamo is a meditation on the circulatory nature of energy and the synchronization of biological and technological systems. It is also an invitation for us to imagine and participate in the dynamos that will energize our future. \n\n\n\nwww.danielcanogar.com/work/dynamo\n\n\n\n\n\n Studio Daniel Canogar:\n\nDaniel Canogar, Artist\n\nDiego Mellado, Project Manager\n\nDiogo Queirós, Developer\n\nAna Saracho, Production\n\nAna Bazán, Production\n\nJorge Anguita, Artistic Production\n\nIván Hernández, Technician\n\nAída Navarro, Architect\n\nMarta Galindo, Communication\n\n\n\nSound Composition:\n\nFrancisco López\n\n\n\nCollaborators:\n\nAndoni Trecet & Aitor Hijar, ALFA Arte\n\nDarien Brito, Programmer\n\nAndré Almeida & tarquino Mota, Artica\n\nCésar Saracho, Engineer\n\nAlberto de Juan, Galería Max Estrella\n\nRaül Estrada, NNConcept\n\n\n\nSpanish Pavilion:\n\nAcción Cultural Española\n\nTemperaturas Extremas\n\nEmpty\n\n\n\n------------\n\nPhotograph by Francisco López.\n\n\n\n© (sound composition) francisco lópez 2021 -  www.franciscolopez.net\n\n Immaterial release by nowhere [worldwide] 2022",

      "about": "francisco lópez - WILDERNESS STUDIO 2005-2019 / On-site Composition in the Wild\n\n\n\nOver the past fifteen years, with the assistance and companionship of some friends, small groups of artists and members of the local communities, I have been directing two consecutive incarnations of an annual residency/workshop at Mamori Lake in the Brazilian Amazon (‘Mamori Sound Project’, 2005-2011) and Mmabolela Reserve in the South African savanna (‘Sonic Mmabolela’, 2013-2019), for composers, audio artists, sound designers and other creative individuals from all over the world. Its focus has been on creative approaches to the work with environmental sound matter, through both recordings and profound listening, by means of an extensive –and I would say iconoclastic– exploration of natural sound environments in those contrasting locations of rainforest and savanna. In a number of different ways –theoretical, practical and experiential– I have been trying to bring in a vigorous questioning of canonical conceptions of so-called ‘field recordings’, a realm of audio creation that has manifested a significant expansion over the past few years but that, in my opinion, has failed to overcome representational clichés and obsolete creative rules. As I see it, the main aim of this experience is neither technical nor conceptual, but rather transformative, from both artistic and personal perspectives. At a personal level, these ‘sonic years’ in the Amazon rainforest and the African savanna (two types of environments I had experienced as a biologist many years earlier in Brazil and Senegal) have had a very profound effect on my experience and conception of sound as both a prodigious phenomenological conduit and an ontological entity in its own right, along with –not subservient to– the other creatures of the rainforest and the savanna. This transcendental transformation has had fundamental outcomes for me, such as what I call ‘field listening’ (a post-media non-representational practice of profound listening in the field) and ‘sonogenic composition’ (a creative approach in which sound itself suggests and leads the compositional decisions, structure and nature). Among many other strategies, in this residency/workshop I proposed the participants to create audio pieces while still in the natural environment, and I did myself a few of those as well over the years. The classic super-analytical procedure of listening through all the many hours of recordings before creating anything might not necessarily be the best one, particularly now that the possible amount of recorded time is so vast. There is also an element of immediacy and immersion in the actual environment that I am convinced has a significant and very positive effect in what we can create under those conditions. This ‘on-site composition in the wild’ naturally brings forth challenging, heuristic and fruitful frameworks of audio creation in the form of spontaneity, incomplete knowledge, non-exhaustive observation, emotional probing of materials, un-systematic decisions, persistent presence of the sonic environment, immediate juxtaposition of listened and recorded ‘reality’, and so forth. This double album compilation presents the on-site composition pieces I created with my portable minimal ‘wilderness studio’ during all the past years of this residency/workshop in the Brazilian Amazon and the South African savanna.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n‘Mamori Sound Project’ at Mamori Lake and ‘Sonic Mmabolela’ at Mmabolela Reserve have materialized as independent projects with virtually no funding, which have been made possible –more often than not against significant odds and through some quite remarkable adventures– by the collective effort of a small group of incredibly dedicated friends, as well as all the international participants:\n\n\n\n[120; from Algeria, Australia, Austria, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Greece, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Iceland, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, The Netherlands, UK, USA]\n\n\n\nWilderness Studio 2005-2011: BRAZILIAN AMAZON\n\n\n\nMy sincere gratitude goes to Asier Gogortza, Jorge Llorella, Nacho Martí, and Martín Azúa (of Mamori ArtLab); Slavek Kwi, Jerson and Katia Vieira da Silva, and the entire Mamori Lake community. \n\nParticipants in ‘Mamori Sound Project’, 2005-2011:\n\nAernoudt Jacobs, Alex Massana, Anders K.

Leur objectif est d’atteindre un climat émotionnel collectif intense, une fureur poétique qui dégage un espace libératoire: un endroit où le spectateur lui-même respirait plus librement et lâcherait prise pour se délester du poids du présent. \n\n\n\nCes hommes et danseurs, Thierry Smits les a sciemment choisis, non pour leur virtuosité technique, mais parce qu’ils sont dotés les uns les autres d’un goût de la recherche dans le mouvement qui est au centre de cette création. Ils viennent de Belgique, d’Allemagne, de Pologne, d’Italie, du Portugal, du Brésil, de France, de Grèce et de Grande-Bretagne.\n\n\n\nEnsemble, ils forment une sorte de tribu éphémère où chacun est aussi bien individualisé qu’attentif et lié aux autres. A la fois êtres singuliers et groupe homogène, leur réunion sur le plateau engendre une mobilité, une fluidité et un équilibre qui permet l’exécution collective d’une danse dont les rites chorégraphiques s’inspirent de la théâtralité que contiennent les transes de possession ou les transes chamaniques et qui nous emportent, hors de nous-mêmes, à la source de nos émotions.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnima Ardens [EN]\n\n\n\nIn constant nudity, which highlights the diversity of their bodies and origins, eleven men, eleven dancers throw themselves, body and soul, into this Anima Ardens or ‘burning breath’.\n\n\n\nSurrounded by the organic sound environments of Francisco López and with the white floor’s backdrop of the Compagnie Thor’s studio, these naked men use their bodies, their breath and their voices.\n\n\n\nTheir dance goes in crescendo to the limits of trance-like practices, until reaching an altered state of their bodies. Their goal is to reach an intense collective emotional state, a poetic fury that releases a liberating space: a place where the audience members can breath more freely and let themselves go to relieve the weight of the present.\n\n\n\nThese men and dancers have been carefully selected by Thierry Smits, not for their technical virtuosity but because they are collectively skilled with a taste for movement exploration that is at the center of this particular creation. They come from Belgium, Germany, Poland, Italy, Portugal, Brazil, France, Greece and Britain.\n\n\n\nTogether they form a kind of ephemeral tribe where everyone is as much individualized as attentive and connected to the others. Simultaneously separate beings and homogeneous group, their meeting on the stage generates a singular mobility, fluidity and balance. These allow for the collective performance of a dance whose choreographic rituals are inspired by the theatrical in posession trance rituals or in shamanic trance, taking us out of ourselves, to the source of our emotions.",

      "about": "Created in 2017 at ‘mobile messor’ (Den Haag, Milano, Zurich, Cagliari, Copenhagen, Mmabolela) and ‘Dune Studio’ (Loosduinen).\n\n\n\n\n\n‘untitled#354’ created from original environmental sound matter recorded worldwide between 1995 and 2016. This piece was commissioned by Sónar Festival for their 2018 25th Anniversary project ‘Sónar Calling GJ273b’  (www.sonarcalling.com/en),  in which they invited a few artists to create short audio pieces for outer space transmission.\n\n\n\nOriginal liner notes:\n\nThe outer space transmission of a 10-second sound piece (digital audio file) to planet ‘GJ 273 b’ of Luyten’s Star (12.5 light years from Earth) required dramatic levels of data compression: mono 8kHz 8-bit. Changes in resolution such as these, however, are not the only possible form of compression. The classic analog technique of pitch shifting by speeding up playback is, in a literal way, also a form of (relatively) reversible temporal compression.\n\n\n\nUsing this idea, I proceeded by: (1) creating a sound piece with 10x 1-minute sections from original environmental recordings I did in wilderness locations around the world [see timeline notes below]; (2) speeding up by pitch-shifting enough octaves to have those 10 minutes time-compressed into 10 seconds; (3) finally applying the required resolution compression for the transmission digital file. Interestingly, the resulting audio from this process distinctively resembles signals from satellites and some celestial bodies, as received and heard from Earth.\n\n\n\nIf any intelligent beings in exoplanet ‘GJ 273 b’ can receive, decode, make sense of, and reverse data compression of the audio digital file (by means of any equivalents of reconstruction algorithms or analytic inversion formulas in their culture), I am pretty sure they will easily figure out its time-compression reversibility. If they do –and assuming they have the techno-anatomical/cognitive equivalents of D/A converters, amps, speakers, ears, and brains– they will be able to have a sonic glimpse of Earth’s ecosystems and some of their non-human creatures (as of the turn of the 21st century; or 12.5 Earth-years into their past). This way, they will be able to make a more informed decision as to how to proceed.\n\n\n\n‘untitled#354’ Timeline:\n\n\n\n00:00 Costa Rica – Rainforest (Mesoamerican)\n\n01:00 Peru – Rainforest (Amazonian)\n\n02:00 Argentina (Patagonia) – Desert\n\n03:00 Spain/Morocco (Chafarinas Islands) – Ocean\n\n04:00 South Africa – Savanna\n\n05:00 Nepal (Himalayas) – High mountain\n\n06:00 Myanmar – Swamp\n\n07:00 Malaysia (Borneo) – Rainforest (Southeast Asian)\n\n08:00 Japan – Park\n\n09:00 New Zealand – Forest\n\n\n\n\n\n‘untitled#357’ created from original environmental sound matter recorded at Mmabolela Reserve (South Africa) during the Austral summer of 2017.\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Barbara Ellison, Sergi Caballero, Enric Les Palau, Jorge Simonet and Pablo Blanco.\n\n\n\nPhotograph by Francisco López. \n\n\n\n(c) francisco lópez 2017 –  www.franciscolopez.net\n\n Immaterial reissue by nowhere [worldwide] 2022\n\n\n\nPreviously released on CD audio (edition 300 copies) by Auf Abwegen (Germany) in 2019:  \n\nwww.aufabwegen.de/label/?p=690",

      "about": "'VirtuAural Electro-­Mechanics'\n\n(machinic pieces 1995 – 2018)\n\n\n\nAbout the first piece of this compilation, originally commissioned for the 25th anniverssary of the Sónar Festival in 2018:\n\n\n\n\"Internationally acclaimed for the intensity, richness and astonishing audio detail of his live immersive surround performances in the dark, sound artist and composer Francisco López has created yet another magnum sonic tour de force in his new ‘VirtuAural Electro-Mechanics’. A creation developed from a myriad of original sound recordings of mechanical machines, electro-mechanical systems and industrial environments gathered over the past 25 years all over the world; from food factories to “white rooms”, from 18th-century automata to computers, from wood and wires to magnetism, from the microscopic to the monumental. Resulting from a massive process of evolution, recombination and spatialization of these materials; merging the “real” with the rise of a new breed of unexistent, magnified, dramatically hyper-real machines; this gargantuan multi-layered creature is all about an extraordinary ontological sonic experience of VirtuAurality in the dark that will put you at the core of The archetypal machine.\"\n\n\n\nPhysical edition supported by the MOP Foundation, the Monomedia Institute and Stroom Den Haag.",

All sonic artifacts have been deliberately generated, selected and maintained for aesthetic reasons.\n\n\n\nPlay at maximum volume:\n\nUnlike the tedious customary traditional recommendation, this is not a loud piece but rather a very subtle one, where the essential sonic details will only be audible –and audible in the right way- at maximum volume (no loud surprises or irresponsible tricks).\n\n[This apparent paradox is explained by intentional subsonics, which actually produce a file-piece with strong amplitude levels (easily seen in the waveform or volume indicators, for those interested) that make impossible an undistorted increase in perceptible volume in the file itself.]\n\n\n\nPlease use decent headphones or speakers:\n\nTypical laptop or handheld-device speakers will render completely inaudible sound (thus generating even more tedious reactions of the head-scratching kind, like “there’s no sound”, “it’s a conceptual silent work”, and crap like that).\n\n\n\n(c) francisco lópez 2015 -  www.franciscolopez.net\n\n\n\n Immaterial reissue by nowhere [worldwide] 2021\n\n\n\nPreviously released on CD-data (edition 200 copies) by Tsonami (Chile) in 2019: \n\nwww.tsonami.cl/tienda/untitled-337-version-extendida-completa-francisco-lopez/",

      "about": "TāWHIRIMāTEA\n\nEnvironmental sound matter from New Zealand\n\nThe Epoché Collection - vol. 4\n\n\n\n“Listening to sound not as the attribute of the visible but as the action of its production descends deep into the core of the visual world, reaching beyond its certain shape into a formless form that is neither object nor subject but the action of their materiality formlessly forming as liquid stickiness that grasps me too but leaves no trace. [...] Such a listening does not pursue the question of meaning, as a collective, total comprehension, but that of interpretation in the sense of a phantasmagoric, individual and contingent practice fiction.” \n\nSalomé Voegelin – ‘Sonic Possible Worlds’ and ‘Listening to Noise and Silence’",

Behind virtual reality in all its forms [...] the real has disappeared. And that is what fascinates everyone. According to the official version, we worship the real and the reality principle, but -and this is the source of the current suspense- is it, in fact, the real we worship, or its disappearance?”\n\nJean Baudrillard – ‘Why hasn’t everything already disappeared?’",

All technological developments seem to converge to one main goal: to overcome humanity, to try and create something transhuman.\n\n\n\n“Are we prepared for dealing with the prospect that humanity is not the end of evolution? ‘Technocalyps’ is an intriguing three-part documentary on the notion of transhumanism by Belgian visual artist and filmmaker Frank Theys.

      "about": "WIND [Patagonia]\n\nEnvironmental sound matter from Patagonia\n\nThe Epoché Collection - vol. 8\n\n\n\n\n\n“There was never a time when human agency was anything other than an interfolding network of humanity and nonhumanity; today this mingling has become harder to ignore.”\n\nJane Bennett – ‘Vibrant Matter’\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Patagonia, vastness and solitude are shaped and reinforced by the constant presence of wind. Contrary to the stereotype of barren empty spaces as ‘quiet’, wind creates there –as in many other places– a relentless environment of sonic strength. Wind is an invisible force that most of the time is hearable through transducers such as plants, rocks, sand, snow or ice. It affects the perception of space, distance, weather and even our own body. As sonic matter, it seems to be made up of an utmost simplicity and gives the illusion of uniformity. That is why its richness is so astonishing and engaging. Wind recordings are essentially a broad-band substance that reconfigures itself in its spectrum composition and its dynamics at every instant, very often with sudden shifts and turns that simultaneously change the virtual space of the recording at an unpredictable and complex pace. Because of these particular features, and of its lack of traditional tonal or rhythmic character, wind might be the ultimate challenge for those seeking ‘music’ in nature in the naive thrill of similarities between natural sonic events and human-made structures.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal environmental sound matter recorded at multiple locations throughout Argentinian Patagonia (Chubut, Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces) during the Austral winters of 2000 and 2003.\n\n\n\nEdited, composed and mastered at ‘mobile messor’ (Buenos Aires, Montreal, Madrid), 2003-2005.\n\n\n\nMany thanks to: Cécile Martin, Amy Denio, Jorge Haro, Ana Knobel, Luis Marte, Karina della Vecchia, Pablo Reche, Pablo Trilnik, José Tono, Luis Prado, Andres Oddone.\n\n\n\nPhotograph: Francisco López.\n\n\n\n(c) francisco lópez 2005 –  www.franciscolopez.net\n\n Immaterial release by nowhere [worldwide] 2025\n\n\n\nPreviously released on CD audio (edition 1000 copies) by and/OAR (USA) in 2007: \n\nwww.and-oar.org/and_27.html",

      "about": "For nearly a decade, starting in 1980, I worked almost exclusively with walkman recorders and cheap cassette players. From the beginning, sound recordings were intuitively for me “worlds in themselves”, always markedly different from the original “reality”, always full of their own thrilling features. I developed my own, very simple -but very efficient- techniques for sound transformation using only cassettes. I couldn’t afford the prototypical “experimental” tools of those times: reel-to-reel recorders, synthesizers, rhythm boxes and the like. With hindsight, this limitation turned out to be a great advantage and an important lesson, that has remained vividly present for me until today: the most essential tools are spiritual, not technical.
