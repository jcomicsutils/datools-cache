            "about": "see  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nSound sculptor Nigel Ayers delivers more intriguing soundscapes, intelligently amalgamating electronic, ethnic, and experimental musics, as exemplified by the electro-ethnic industrial hybrid Boo, and the noise-ethno-techno of Load II where organic hand percussion meets a flittering sequencer, dance beats, and backwards flute. And it’s fun, too: every experiment is prefaced by an excerpt from illegally recorded phone calls – truly banal, useless conversations with annoying people.",

            "about": "Nigel Ayers, the founder of this British trio, live in Newcastle, near Stonehenge, which may explain the fog-haunted, Cimmerian atmosphere of Nocturnal Emissions’ industrial new age. These are curiously restful, these long, droning instrumentals, and develop gradually, like moss growing on the dark side of a dolmen. Gravelly samples – played, according to one article, on Casio SK-5s – add what Pierre Schaeffer called \"grain\": a rough-edged quality that makes music sound gritty or abraded. The ghost of Kitaro is effectively banished.\nKeyboard magazine\nIn keeping with its journey out of the noisy musical world of industrial music, Nocturnal Emissions’ Cathedral features serene and sparse ambient music. The patterns on this album develop slowly, if not minimalistically. Delicate, often iridescent electronics form drones or little figures which loop in slow progressions. Dissonant sounds are often used, but usually so subtly that they nearly escape notice, or do little more than bring you to alertness. From time to time, unobtrusive concrete sounds similar to tiny whistles, clocks, hinges, water gurgles, sandpaper rubbings, etc appear. Though the group cycles numerous pitches and timbres through any one piece, the music’s serenity is maintained by its near static patterns. With three of the five pieces being 12- to 24-minutes long, nothing happens fast, yet the music is never boring.\nTom Grove\nOption",

            "about": "see  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nOkay, well, one, if you've no idea who Nigel Ayers (Nocturnal Emissions) is and yet find yourself wanting to know, go here:  www.earthlydelights.co.uk.  You'll quickly find that Nigel's been a busy man in his lifetime. If you're new to his discography, god help you and start buying lottery. Nevertheless, starting at Collateral Salvage is as good a place as any, 'cause you gotta start somewhere mate, and this one is candy.\nThe incorporated electronic and organic elements of Morocco in the dipsy funk and trip of the typical Emissions thoughtsound is exquisite. Granted, the subtext, undercurrent, etc. of Emissions is generally postmodern deconstruction of this, that, and the other thing or post-post modern political rage, it doesn't matter if you're on the bandwagon or even the believe in the bandwagon to be seriously grooved and carried along by the Emissions sound.\nThe overall feeling of this is serendipitous and tenaciously lighthearted. Don't get the idea that everything Ayers does is as such, 'cause it ain't, but if you're curious about this guy, throw your expectations out the window anyway. Just delve. So, this one shimmers; other works, such as those with Mick Harris or Randy Grief, are completely different. Some bounce, some screech, some wail. If you're curious, spend some time with Nigel Ayers and his catalogue. It's not exceptionally expensive to find his recordings with Emissions (and others) on Ebay and in other places, and then you'll better be able to place the newer recordings in context to the previous work. Plan on thinking a lot about how packaging relates to content, or sound relates to subtext. Or not. The invitation is always there, to explore with Nigel some back alleyways of thought and action, or, to just turn off the old noggin' and follow along with your eyes closed.\nThis one's beautiful, textural, pleasant; unless you read the song titles and wonder. Wonder, wander, do what you will, these songs are bliss. Even if you don't think you're interested in the music, if you see an Emissions CD in a music store, it's worth checking into Nigel's penchant for cut at paste art and his graphic sensibility. This one's a corker, art-wise.\nGoat\nwww.starvox.net\nNigel Ayers returns in his Nocturnal Emissions guise, decomposing and disarranging who-knows-what sources into the twistedly bright constructions of Collateral Salvage. A hoot!\nDrum-thrumming fun begins when Jesus' Twin Brother bounds onto the scene... a blur of beats, jangles and bits of televangelical-speak are wound into a bouncy bop. Burn, Bush, Burn relaxes (albeit a bit surreally) in an islandic vibe where flutes and strums float upon buoyant basslines and pattering rhythms. Groovin' With Mr. Slow marks the first of several occurrences in which Eastern sound forms (here sitar twangs and tweedling reeds) are woven into a magic-carpet of perkiness. Bassy Puchobongo is embedded with start-n-stop musicality looping through a lurching groove, and topped by exotic percussion-play. Seductively gauzy bass struts across a bed of smoldering jungledrums in I See You're With Eeyore while smoky wails of voice and sax writhe in the distance. Weirdly wavering Bunker Buster gradually coalesces into a danceable tapestry, again edged with Middle-Eastern accents. Stirred by spattering beats, muted jangle-rock sways beneath a gauze of pleasantly disorienting esoterica in Resistance Is Fertile , followed by the bouncy ditty of Listen, Little Man. Delicate strings trickle into Running Water, to be pumped up by cool rhythms and Easternish effects... mesmerizing! The brassy warpings of sitar strings meander through the percussive patterns of glowing Lah De La De Saki Ya making for a warm farewell. With 15 peppy (and interestingly arranged) instrumentals, it's easy to get something good out of Collateral Salvage.\nSonic collage-work from Nocturnal Emissions earns a happy A-.\nDavid J Opdyke\nAmbiEntrance",

Recorded between 1980 and 1984.\nNocturnal Emissions remain faithful to an interior clock of their own on Duty Experiment, a compilation of mid-80s glory-days outtakes that features some nostalgically post-punk titles like Tanks in Gdansk and Even The Good Times Are Bad. The music sounds not unlike the live vivisection of old ARP 2600 synthesisers. Takes the paint off walls.\nPaul Stump\nThe Wire",

A stream burbled away, twenty metres of moving, swirling speckles of scarlet, topaz, azure  and violet, flickered and vanished flinging off swirling clouds of real books. Hot hair curled into tight ringlets and tangled clumps; curved gracefully running down alleyways, and now weighed fifty pounds, twenty times as much as it should have . In fact, I saw on her screen an image of huge hidden reservoirs that fell and fell. Next I saw some representations chosen at a car park thirty yards to the left. He shook his head: no. I pointed the remote control at the television and pressed the button in the corner repeatedly. The screen brightened , and rotated around and around , a  flat black and white image appeared. It was soft and pliable, abruptly changing through ninety degrees, smudging and dripping. Without proper contrast, for a few seconds, then back to one shade of white and grey static and then it slid out of sight. Under my feet, three simple forty metre screens and two complex ones. Twenty metres from the ground, all these rain-scoured images that are treated with a light-reflecting paint, flapping around overhead, there’s no one looking. Such long, dark images filled the floors, unable to focus with a series of parts that when put together form a language. One by one, I peeled out the pictures, dripping rainwater, trailing a thick film of saliva behind scattered in huge, concave triangles.",

I encountered numerous setbacks that tested my resilience and determination. It was far from a flawless entrance onto the scene, unlike the divine arrival spending seven days in creation, as the concept of time itself was still in its embryonic stages. The sun had not yet graced the cosmos with its radiant presence, and the days stretched out over an indeterminate span, taking millions of years to complete. These early stages of my adventure were marked by a constant ebb and flow, a dance between progress and stumbling blocks. I didn't emerge as a god-like figure, perfectly poised and omnipotent. Instead, I found myself navigating through a chaotic landscape where every step forward was met with unforeseen challenges, a stark contrast to the divine creation stories whispered through the cosmic winds. In the nascent phases of existence, beginnings took on the role of an assimilation point, a convergence of possibilities and uncertainties. It was a juncture where the fabric of reality seemed to weave itself together, each thread representing a potential path. Yet, like caution signs around an excavation site, warning of hidden pitfalls, my journey was fraught with moments of hesitation and reflection. \"Whoa! Caution: excavations in substation,\" the signs proclaimed, echoing through the corridors of my mind. These words served as a reminder that the path ahead was not always clear, and I needed to tread carefully through the uncharted territories of my own creation. But that was only the beginning. Determined to unravel the mysteries of my existence, I ran my experiences through the computer of introspection. The digital machinery of self-reflection whirred to life, processing the raw data of my journey. It dissected the false starts, wrong turns, and setbacks, transforming them into lines of code that held the essence of my growth. As the lines of code scrolled across the screen, a narrative emerged. It was a tale of resilience, of learning from mistakes, and of forging ahead despite the uncertainty that shrouded the path. The assimilation point of beginnings began to take shape as a canvas, painted with the vibrant hues of triumphs and tribulations. The computer became my companion in this journey of self-discovery, a silent confidant that translated the chaos into a coherent story. It was a tool that allowed me to see beyond the surface, to understand the intricacies of the narrative etched into the fabric of my existence. In the grand tapestry of life, my beginnings were not a mere prologue but a pivotal chapter. The caution signs served as guideposts, urging me to explore the depths of my being with a mindful heart. As I moved forward, the excavation of my own soul continued, revealing layers of complexity and depth that mirrored the vastness of the cosmos itself. And so, with each keystroke and reflection, my story unfolded—a testament to the resilience found in the face of uncertainty, a symphony composed from the cacophony of beginnings. Or so the computer told me.",

As a truck drove through the gate, a voice suddenly echoed in the air.  Imagine the birches, think about the mathematics.  Two warehouses full of big-wheel solar cycles, elaborately painted in shades of light, and thousands of coins, intricately carved frames, hooped over stout crown mouldings. The room was over twenty feet high, wide as a chateau. If someone tried to enter, powerful magnetic clips holding large bottles of shampoo detect the faintest chemical signatures and toxins.  What does this mean?  In a minute, you'll find just about the smallest of small things you can find. The food in this cupboard here, in plain sight, along the same fault line face, the spirals in the dark.  He'd hardly hung his coat and booted up the application.  His arms and legs were screaming before his eyes, because they're just into the place, out and through the only doorway, with an actual door in it. Ah, the one and only sweat shaker. She approached, carefully, she wheeled closer, to the weak, grey and flat shreds of nothing, and two professionals broke into a fit of coughing.",

Something slithered away. I sat in a smoke-shrouded bar, down a cold wet passage, with paintings for sale at fancy prices.  The sensation of being drugged faded, I stopped and squinted.  The pictures were of letters, six feet high. The artists, all on special commission, under contract.  And you know, they were obsolete.  They were past it. Then I walked over to the woman, I said, I said, get out. Oh, nobody could work in an area like this.  In the background, the gas-meter made some kind of a mysterious signal. Twelve thousand miles away, black smoke boiled with a sense of decay.  My carbine over my shoulder, I walked briskly, looking for reality, but finding only heavy objects.  She interrupted me with a little moan. Words tumbled and slashed at the car.  Leaves pressed like hands against her shoulder.  It seemed that she was a regular here. Spooling through, keeping the tape under control, gripping the warm, taut machine shaft at the top, and looking out at the heather and bracken and gorse.  She started hallucinating, and the shafts looked steep.  And it was at least a thousand hours until dusk. A summer of excitement and adventure forced him from her hard drives.  He's down there in the dark.  He could feel her searching his eyes for clues. He kept his eye on the digital. She found nothing interesting.  She contemplated how she would like to watch the ceremony. It was tricky work to refine the random images in the right order.  Put their spoils on display.  Let them speak for themselves. Allowing several seconds until her eyes shook with the madness of it.  Perfectly splashing all the sensitive vertical and horizontal surfaces of her sex.  Computer searches only worked when you had shaken the place down. Three in the afternoon, she said, the guy had grabbed the mic and dropped it in the dead man's pocket.  And hitched his tom-toms closer into the hollows of the mortars.  The music built up into a thundering, followed by one of those recorded chimes. And leftist revolutionaries rolled the prepared log onto herbs, garlic, with quick glances to their standard roadmaps of the local area.  Trying to fit them into coherent order to dig out historic adventures from almost indecipherable typing.  That's right, I agreed. Everyone's a writer, and we will make a pleasurable hobby into a lucrative way of earning. That, at least, was the theory.  But a very long time later, I sat looking at ninety-two pages of random, muddy, melted mush. Broad stripes of sunshine on the wall beside the washing machine.  The man was listening hard, and very faintly, he spotted the red record light.  He'd never grasped the subtleties of the machine, so he froze alone, his head bent. He scratched at his scrotum, he began to jive around, his hands slapping down, his eyes closed. He was repeating softly to himself: the trick is to pretend that the work has an elusive ring of authenticity.  The whisper of the ancient oaks, whitish silhouettes against the velvet of night, noises of bladderwrack and crusting mud, of the morning's high tide. You can come with me, yeah, come on.",

The photo lab spotlights swung in arcs, focused on me.  With each breath I take my left hand seems to get lighter. I visualise it rising off my lap.  Pulsing flesh, scraping, biting, saturated credit card numbers, cracked glass, her right leg a serial port. Bright, flashing colours splashed each wall, avalanche of hot juices, poetic justice and seismic waves for the soul.  The drop-outs, the weirdies, the bauble, bangle and bead brigade on the books and records and.. “Let us go upstairs and sample those delights we enjoyed so long ago.” “Groovy,” said the girl, and she smiled, the flame’s reflection glistening in her eyes. “Give us a kiss.” He brings out the lukewarm bucket and places it in the centre of the room. I now concentrate on my left hand.  I see it in my mind’s eye with my eyes closed, in a deep state of relaxation.  Now my left hand touches my left cheek.  Step 9  Step 8 can be repeated.  Some may wish to watch instead of participate.  Others who start may wish to drop back to the sidelines.  Fine. Fine for the first three thousand miles  Step 5  A mesmerised monochrome system flashed through my brain.  The hum the piercing twang and boom - stark tendrils of life, that’s all. It just didn’t look right.  My thoughts were running naked and hell, baby, I was involved. You know, I was handsome, young , dynamic, a fighter, a swinger.  Branches smacking, deep deep sadness bellowed wordlessly  Step 4 Walk. That’s’ what the little piece of paper says.  That’s the whole point. “I’ll put it as plainly as I can,” she said,  The station was empty.  His telephone rang.  He stepped on to the platform.  He looked at his watch hopefully. He sat on a bench and smacked his lips many times as though not knowing what to expect. Savouring outdoor noises, nooks and crannies with quick-jigsaw warmth.  The thin wail of sirens.  A sucking sensation, clear plastic bubbles. Inclement weather stroked the windows, burning, shifting,  A hundred deer, a hundred boar, feathery hair, imminent climax  A hundred empty nights  Gleams of a fugitive humour “Can I keep this?”  there was a long silence.  Step 7  It was Imbolc, the happy time.  They squatted on the floor and nothing on underneath the dress she wore.  I continued to look at the floor for sixty seconds. Step 8 At first it tickled.  Half-opened eyes fluttered.  Dead eyes in the living figment.  In twenty years’ time, two people would be looking curiously at the tattoo.  There was a transparent wall facing the ocean,  The rounded form of a circular building.  There was an awkward silence  The voice in a little squawkbox.  Memorising each feature.  Feeding, cleaning, working.  And in one hour, without a single shot, surrounded by green hills and fronted by a sweeping promenade and wide sandy beach, our tour bus drove off a viaduct.  With its dramatic coastal views.  Will blood flow in the streets?  Three days later, we’ll have time to further explore watch the ground crew below moving like bees and watch the dial jump. I grinned at him and hoisted the beer.  He pulled a manila envelope out from the van,  The train began to slow down, and made appropriate noises then it stopped in the open somewhere … And the smoke drifted thick. I grinned at him and shook my head.  “No.”  An hour went by, and before you know it, night is fallen and another day is done.",

Chemical-smelling paper responded to his vision.  It was tricky.  It was laden with rotting leaves,  The smell enveloped him He wore a single black leather glove.  He appeared to come from nothing, come out of the air, out of the void – a face, a room. a black crescent-shaped crack all year round  but every time they’d draw a blank.  She sniffed and turned her back on him.  “No way.”  Another shake of the head, another wave flooded in, a change in the quality of the air.  A bank of television sets, strobe lights.  The lights everywhere were so bright.  No time for work or thought any more. The brightness was harsh and didn’t fade overnight.  I didn’t get any sleep.  At that moment the strange cave-painting designs drop to the bottom to form a pool of one long word no one will ever read.  The document scrolls continuously, its pages ooze letters of plastic rain. But she could hear the thunder and see the electronic storm.  The sky looked beaten, bruised, and swollen.  These days with a whoosh and a roar special programs induced dangerous ideas and acted like a hammer Break through firewalls.",

Put his eyes back in place, so the eyelids could get over the pulpy mess. The bowl he was drinking from spilled borrowed armour.  Naked she cringed,  Piece of paper in the dark.  A powerful throbbing mounted up, up her dress and scurrying out of the room. He was seeing someone else, that's how it was.  He was still struggling with it, as they saw on his Facebook page.  The streets will be littered with the cold shiver of feet bellowing in pain. For a few seconds his legs trembled, and filthy degenerate capitalist running dog damnation.  What about your boys?  He had to squeeze the words out between lips, through his legs.  Some lusting voyeur, he felt a thousand little interior rhythms. She was giggling.  He's a wise runt, beyond the level of the ape. Pencilling in the ladies pubes, from the darker corners, there came muffled squeals. It was so carefully painted out.  Sometimes the door closed all the way to the crevice.  Not for the first time, she had approached the open windows.",

A car rolling backwards, with the dreamer gently chafing her fanny against my shoulder. His forefinger was stiff from taking parallel tracks, front gates and porches, horns and squealing brakes, doorbells, pneumatic doors, hissing, oil, asphalt, old weeds, rags.  Something just nudged.  Dreams too, dreams speak to him. In fairy tales and parables, theirs is a language of symbol and analogy.  Dark and slick, almost too dark to see.  But people seem addicted to retail. Throbbing basslines, just a good noise.  Wouldn't that be fab?  What's all this?  Better by far to put it down  While others lag behind in a slow lane. It was used by priests in ancient times. It was known to most Neolithic people.  It was the human voice. It matters in his life.  It protects against negative thoughts, can yield a cure.  But pick it up, turn up the volume another few centimetres. Do it, develop a glitch, do not waste it.  Express inner forces and prompt a change in habits as well.  There was a long silence. The hum of the generators.  A cluster of carbon dancers.  Then a naughty little hand teased my prick again. Oh my gosh.  With glowing photocopied and printed eyes.  The armoured television, black with grease. Strung out on carbon.  The leads, wires and cabling.  The black dot at its tip powdering into tiny crystals.  The name of the programme, said Jackman, is Whore, Blow, Minorities.  When an even layer of grease had been applied to a set of studios, offices interlinked by closed circuit TV, a supporting timber is removed from under each end of the lovely 48-track desk.  I turned up the volume again. Remember, it is gas volume. And I mean gas, not gasoline in the mixing room.",

She could hear the stacks of blonde hair and grey hair plunging into the bottles of red and black ink, grinding through the machine.  Of course, he said, the community have folded up something for you, in two pieces of metal, plywood boards, wood, brick, and concrete. He hit fast forward for just a few seconds, and the nerve tube started to project images of hands, elbows, shoulders, toes, heels, and knees up onto the four foot long wood frame.  He then clicked one of the controls, and used the tape deck as a lever.  He saw the light inside gradually intensify, as the slowly turning television monitor stopped again, and waited for someone, anyone. He started huffing and puffing.  The heat rising from the tape made the beams and the logs waver and bend.  What's going on?  The shafts and gears slowly begin to merge, all the sheets, no matter if they're scattered all over the place. We thought the ever-deepening pool of dirt and oil would be a good place to do things thought impossible.",

One of the large windows came into view, two hundred feet above the abyss below.  I need everyone’s undivided attention in order to duplicate the dark green surface reflectance.  I’ll do so much walking in this town, tomorrow, it would give her prefrontal cortex some small satisfaction.  Smiling, blushing, vinyl-tile floors, and the walls were painted with naked, white noodles, like worms.  He minds his own business and doesn’t look for hats and plastic swords obviously intended for tourists.  Meanwhile, the superior tech seemed to magnify the brightness a hundredfold but also focused on the words.  She’d have to have clung to the glowing pillars, rising two hundred feet into the darkness.  She still didn’t even know if the lighter effect was like a single candle burning in that area responsible for language.  Her stomach tightened and it was gratifying to see.  “Look at this.”  He had examined her legs, ambling around her, taking a seat and setting his laptop down,  the way he did things made it all smooth.  They have surprisingly good glowing translucent pillars, with years of history, before that eventual flash of neurological stimulation took place.  The surface would not support her in the dim light and it was definitely frustrating.  The spaghetti came sliding onto the funnel at the apex high above. There were his voodoo kits and a variety of crystals and some pirate grime pressed deep into cracked tile floors. For one thing, her roots and herbs place had been ancient, dreary, in need of paint,  she reminded herself.  The left lobe processes definitely smelled greasy.  She crept out of the bathroom and poured herself a pale yellow glass so naturally and deftly, she did that all the time.  Like this sequence of images seemed to be made of lead, but lighter and in different categories. Something raw thwanged inside her mind: a microscope composed of knotted rags exploded in her head.  She heaved a deep sigh and pointed towards the spotlessly clean room.  She weighed them and clutched the greyish-brown tissue in her forearms.  And she always knew what was wrong.  She provided an injection of adrenaline to his system that gave way at times to fearful depressions.  He threw his head back as far as it would go as he kissed and sucked.  He moved his wheelchair to avoid being sliced in a ball of simmering desire, as mind wrecking and body shredding as it was in their current location.  Every time she looked at him, a memory of scattering and shattering descended, dismayed, half-grins on their faces, a soaring, airy quality. She ran her hands down the muddy green wall of water, but there was no sound.  All these experiences allowed him to stop the alarm just long enough to give attention to the twelve-hundred-square-foot space.",

A shot sounded only a couple of streets away.  Running feet could be heard. Then an attacking force of plate glass windows seemed to burst open.  Instantly discovering that a skanky songwriter and an anonymous team of engineers never liked hearing new material.  But there was something else doing my head in, shrivelling slowly in memory, tumbling to its knees on the ground. Somewhat vexed that had happened.  Where there really isn't such a place left anymore.  Everywhere where to hear rather than to feel. And fell to the ground, shuddering together, weakly lit by a light from the first floor.  She enabled cryptographers to leave her their pop anthems with over two dozen files. Having correctly guessed the difference between many bridges for a hypothesized model of interaction, Jack pressed a key on his laptop. Music filled the room, the engine immediately turning, pushing between them, firing bursts not known consciously by the dreamer.  The speakerphone behind the locked front door exploded outwards a split second before he fell through several hundred dermatological orifices like hair follicles across the street. Beneath the row of buttons the tape played like the rest of them. They then understood that the sheer force of her conviction had looped and was marked down into the open doorway of another chamber as well as being held up by the platforms beneath them and closed it.  I pointed this out and bent ears and proved it.  No doubt they have already forgotten to watch him transform the last lingering busload down the romantic lines of the main vertical shaft beyond it. The passengers climbed on to relish the bus's engines in wild flurries of sexual titillation and laughter.  We can spread this into a more bilateral look at the wide concrete chasm in front of the ring of blue stones on the clitoris bundle.  It's all there, you know you must join us to think of something square, no gimmicks, no time to lose. The sooner we get moving before the sprawling engine directs itself right out of the middle lane and into the romantic area of the red, white and blue front entrance, the better.  Right, reaching under his seat, the driver pushed, folded, clicked, adjusted, humming, using his smile and his eyes and with his hands straight up, batten twirled a screwdriver. Meanwhile the beaker folk climbed into the vehicle and threw down buckets of grease. The engine was reassembled and the device was levered from one side and then back, dropped down the vertical shaft on the driver's side, back inside the cross vent first, then rocking back and forth out of the loop to a sudden halt in the correct position over the supporting columns, down, up and down in its distinctive socket.",

Crash into the charcoal, jagged peaks dribble something old and brittle, a capsule of nothing but emptiness.  After this came three pages of wiggling, wormy lines. Before they were swallowed up by the mist, I was meeting a meeting of minds. I started jabbering on about the busy village, little dogs and hieroglyphs.  And within minutes, we agreed a single paragraph that seemed to sum up the video project. And within a week, after further exchanges on the phone, produced a 24-page photocopy document. He listened and studied, and thought he heard chimes, but the sound turned out to be a low whistling howl. Can anybody hear me?  I know you've got the world's best equipment, helping to check out a rippling reflection in water, reflected twice.  Shaggy and stained with the impression of people and their real-life stories.  There was no response, only indifferent silence, crackling the air of the Cornish coast. Then he realized they were eyes, the eyes of his own self-hatred, all dripping off the edge of the sill.  A gleaming metallic object hovered  the documents were what you were looking for,  you found the diagrams didn't you? I rolled off the couch and cradling the aerosol cans a dozen pairs of glowing green eyes were clinking like glass. To stare a slice of wildness. He could spend an eternity studying this fascinating backwash,  Taking notes in his notebook which was full of fine watercolours of tear gas packages, short-haired German men and French women. Every day, requited love, lifelong love, and the wrong love.  A wave of revolution lifted him.  He took the photograph of frothing waves from me, scanned it, and turned the TV off. Then at 10 o’clock I stopped looking at the photograph and pushed lightly, I thought this might help  Northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest, a large work table separated the largest part of the main room from the tacked-on cable and wireless technology just inside the doors. And a small canister of liquid from a tiny administrative centre across the grass The master tapes from last night were blanked out and lost in a parking lot As the helicopter slowly rose up into the air they stopped at the end of the tunnel and filled the shopping cart But what was it the guy had said on the phone? Focus your thoughts by not thinking, he grinned They found off scraps of ventilation duct coming out of the soft-edged bulletin board She asked if she could sleep The only power came from batteries Rattling the recorded tapes They got out of the pick-up and pushed their way through a dense thicket that blasted out windows  the opening was covered with a dull silver windshield  she spun around on the toes of her low heeled shoes Outside night had fallen in inky finality, as if it never thought you were interested.  The blinds of the windows were pulled shut, giving the crumbling office complete privacy.  Of course, her gaze, through the slats on the closet door raise the hair that had flashed on the screen. Holding her breath and crouched behind some boxes she watched it go down, slowly, as far as the eye could see. She slid her gaze to the sculpture, her sculpture revealed in her headlights. The original idea of mixing backtalk from the two old gals and up to twenty peculiar habits of the American young.",

            "about": "Recorded in 2005.\nJohn Charles Fare was born in 1936 in Toronto and attended Forest Hill College. In 1959 he moved to London to study architecture at the Bartlett School of Architecture, but soon left to live in Copenhagen. He was briefly held in a mental health facility for exposing himself in public at performances. After his release, he was re-arrested for gluing objects to a car.\nThe car's owner, musician and inventor Golni Czervath, did not press charges and befriended Fare. The two developed a robotic operating table with painter Gilbert Andoff. The first performance was a lobotomy on Fare in June 1964. All performances were performed on a Friday.\nBy the time Fare performed at the Isaacs Gallery in Toronto on 17 September 1968, he \"was short one thumb, two fingers, eight toes, one eye, both testicles, and several random patches of skin.\" The amputated parts were preserved in alcohol. That evening, he had his right hand amputated.\nFare's body was fitted with small microphones, which transmitted his pulse and breathing frequency in a distorted fashion. Fare performed six more shows between 1968 and 1972.\nSource: Wikipedia (accessed 06.03.2020)",

            "about": "Matteo Uggeri (aka Barnacles) has been a huge fan of Nocturnal Emissions early works, especially the albums \"Befehlsnotstand\" and \"Drowning in a Sea of Bliss\".\nWhen Nigel Ayers, founder of the band in 1980 in London, contacted him to contribute to Matteo's blog Concrete Shelves, his eyes popped out.\nThey afterwards met in Milan, played a gig together at the legendary Macao, became friend, and got involved into a remix project for Starlight Assembly on the US label Beacon Sound.\nIn 2022 it was then time to make something more structured together, so they exchanged some files between Milan and Cornwall.\nThe result is this album, actually composed \"From Solstice to Equinox\" of last year. It's focused one of Nigels and Matteo main passions: dub.\nBut it's of course a deeply weird version of it, with the mysterious vocals of the British cut-up in a nearly pop-oriented way by the Italian, who also added any sort of field recording to the analogue loops (guitar, samples, kbd...) of his companion. Moreover, the arrangements of cellos, violins, bass, ukulele and God-knows-what by the usual several Matteo's friend are completing this \"hard to fit into a genre\" set of songs.\nNocturnal Emissions was founded in 1980 by Nigel Ayers together with collaborators Daniel Ayers and Caroline K. They have released numerous records and CDs in music styles ranging from electro-acoustic, musique concrete, hybridised beats, sound collage, post-industrial music, ambient and noise music.\nEarly albums on the band's own Sterile Records were harsh noisy affairs, until Songs Of Love And Revolution turned to near synth pop melodies.\nMatteo Uggeri is an Italian visual designer and composer from Milan. He invests himself in sound poetry of everyday life, organized around personal field recordings, captivating beats and melodic compositions arranged in a story-telling way. He has been active in music since 1996 and has collaborated with many groups from the Industrial and Goth scene, including M.B., Controlled Bleeding, De Fabriek, and This Mortal Coil singer Dominic Appleton.\nTogether, they create this dub-oriented beats with cut-up vocals that are hard to fit into a genre.\nIt's a playful affair and a pure pleasure to listen to.",

            "about": "This was the second LP by Nocturnal Emissions, originally released by Sterile Records.\n\"The new LP from the emission control technicians – induction of unaesthesia is complete – a vivisection experiment with you, the listener, as victim\".\nIt is a incredibly intense album which is designed to work at the inside of your head, rather than your feet.\nLD-50 (Side 2 Track 1) is possibly the most frightening piece of music – at high volume it’s real head-banging material. Be in no doubt about this, you will probably not enjoy this album, but you will grow to love it and maybe need it.\nThe following piece from John McGuffin’s The Guineapigs is to my mind the perfect verbal accompaniment to the Music of N.E.: \"Dragged along. Pushed into a chair, hood pulled off. Screaming blinding light, questions fast and hard, couldn’t speak. \"Spell your name\". Tried to find the letters, swimming in my brain – couldn’t spell my name. I must be insane. More questions – blows, hair pulled. Still can’t see well. A table – three men at it – all writing – blinding light. I was told I would be given half an hour to rest and think. Then I would be asked more questions and if I didn’t answer them I would be taken back to the \"music room\" – the room with the noise- pain.\"\nVox\nN. E...use sound to clarify and communicate a concept, not illustrate its cause. Ominous electronics, intense yet subtle in many ways. A bleak commentary on life, death and the Industrial Revolution. Nightmarish stuff.\nEurock",

            "about": "see:  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\n..’ with Futurist Antiquarianism, lead \"emitter\" Nigel Ayers creates inventive electronic music and transforms drum 'n' bass rhythms into something uniquely his own. The lazily rippling warbles and mutant reggae pulses of Earthlights are thoroughly battered by a drum'n'bass barrage; very listenable for the moody serenity below as well as the hyperactive micro-syncopations above. Simmering electric murk flows into the intriguingly arranged though aeons break laced with dozens of other ghostly sound sources flitting about, to be temporarily joined by mid-tempo, ruffly beats and other phantasmal musical appearances, from symphonic strings to blaring brass to shapeless undulations. Like dance music for extraterrestrial robots, they will not touch you eventually introduces spacy hypermodulated blips to superrhythmic distortions, chilling out then surging back, with brief untintelligible vocal utterances.\nPercussion-free Blind Faith seems to move slowly through an abstractly ominous (though entrancing) tunnel of echoing soundwaves and glowering latent energy. One may not be sure of the sonic apparitions of cursus; heavily distorted choir-like choruses (and other oddly reshaped soundforms) waft hypnotically, then receive determinedly pattering e-drumbeats. gridlock continues in a similarly unknowable vein of spooky alterations, churning beatlessly amid gigantic cyclonic forces. Spirited yet subdued, netshaker enters some sort of neo-electro-tribal world, dancing to a dubby bassline and low-key percussive fun. With a buoyant basslike riff, Shetani also emits a bit of an island-vibe, though certainly not straight-forwardly so, with a louder rhythm section. Buzzing currents traverse the spacious netherworld of on come on, where occasional odd noises come and go including weird voice-like interjections, a particularly scritchy pattern and a pair of repeated spoken samples; the track then reprises the previous one, fading to silence at its conclusion. guiding beam, in turn, revisits the beginning of its predecessor... Conceptually, Futurist Antiquarianism offers a bit to think about vis-á-vis past and present time, but in practical usage it's mostly just a fun listen... Unpredicatable arrangements of electronics and beats rank this Nocturnal Emissions at an appreciative 8.4 on the AmbiEntrance scale.\nDavid J Opdyke\nAmbiEntrance",

            "about": "see:  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nSlowly pulsating drones, chirping electronics, distant radio static. Ambient or minimal? To answer the question, it might help to go back a couple of millennia to the Epicurians. Today their name mostly evokes indulgence in fleshly pleasures but that only one form of their thinking; the other sought to deny the body excess experiences. Though the difference isn’t always audible, ambient tries to envelop a listener in pleasant fluffiness while minimalism wants to remove any nonessentials to focus more intensely on the sound. My digression explains why Glossalalia can be an involving album, even on repeated hearings. At first, it seems just to flow with no real point, but soon the music racks into focus, much as long-distance runners claim to break through to a type of euphoria. Musical materials this austere, even delicate, can’t be handled abruptly; the long stretches of time are necessary to bring out their unique nature. Glossalalia may not demand too much of your attention but if you listen closely, the experience could be rewarding.\nLang Thompson\nOption magazine\nLike most bands from the industrial era, Nocturnal Emissions is how the working name for a soloist. Nigel Ayers makes a very different music now to the once gut-wrenching onslaughts of their early albums, with a music that is created for atmosphere, created using sampling and studio technology, or as the cover says \"Disarranged and Decomposed\", making a strange sonic experience with all manner of twisted and mutilated sounds. Just the right number of sonic extremes and surprising twists make it most engaging, and all-told quite original.\nAlan Freeman\nAudion",

            "about": "see  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nINVOCATIO BEASTIA DEI (Invocation of the Beast Gods) is a well-paced and deftly layered collage based on location recordings of night creatures – bats, owls, foxes, insects and sea animals. Like many of Nocturnal Emissions’ previous recordings, it combines natural with synthetic sounds in a wholly musical blend. The key to the success of this disc is its rhythm. Every sound has its own looped pattern (many of the sounds are looped), and when these different but complimentary patterns are combined, a dense and enticing aural landscape emerges. This is not empty new age music, meandering, slapdash sound collage, or low-budget field recording, but a meticulously laid out and painstakingly arranged musical environment.\nNeil Strauss\nEar Magazine",

            "about": "Recorded between Spring 1989 and Summer 1990. All the vocal parts on this recording are performed by singers under the age of 18 months. They are:\nFaye Kilsby\nLucy Round\nTom Heale\nSee also  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nIt looked so innocent at first. Picture of a shrine to a saintly infant on the cover, titled to suggest holiness and docility, it sat in the CD review drawer like an orphan on a doorstep. It needed attention, understanding, a sensitive ear. So I adopted it.\nLittle did I know I’d just brought Damien into my apartment.\nTitles like Eeeeurr, Lleeehh, and Gooraruh should’ve been omens – hellspawn probably would make those noises – but instead I got lulled by the inlay booklet. It lured me with bits of info on babies’ spontaneous singing and vocal capabilities, fired my curiosity when it said the assembled instrumentals were \"based on the song babbles and sound effect made by infants, to create a new form of music\".\nThen it scared the living hell out of me. This, friends is not Lullabyes from the Womb.\nIt’s an industrial soundscape, where tape loops, found noises and mechanical dronings run free, unfettered by normal song structures or any human voice older than 1. Looped into rhythm tracks, or distorted into the lowing of Satan’s cattle, these infants sounds move Mouth of Babes way beyond ambient into…what?\nEerie, unsettling – arcane, even – and too far into the mystic for \"normal\" listening. Its incantations are uniform, repetitive and totally impenetrable for anyone out for nifty \"alternative\" \"music\". It demands effort, attention and imagination, and it’ll frustrate anyone who tries otherwise: dancing or having sex to it won’t cut it (I know. I’ve run control tests) (With or without restraining device – Inquisitive ed.) and merely listening through all 70 minutes borders on ritualistic.\nAnd maybe ritual is what this album is about: the booklet closes off with an \"Occultistic Note\" of suggestions on designing magickal systems and warnings against \"parasites and vampies of Control\". And maybe there does have to be some mystical communion before Mouth of Babes will speak its secrets.\nAnd maybe – just maybe – I’d be willing to shed the spiritual sweat to get to it.\nChris O’Connor\nEye magazine",

Whatever practical time travel may be, all we have are disembodied titles like Electrostatic Field Equation and Gravitational Repulsion to suggest vague imagery for the meandering washes of tone and sound. If I might venture further (and someone please keep me covered in case I disappear up my own arse) this could almost be the experience of being as far from the grinding machines and noise of humanity as possible, drifting into the vacuum of deep space, carried away into the void by solar winds.\nWar Arrow\nSound Projector 6",

            "about": "This was a \"cusp\" record for Nocturnal Emissions, marking the end of a period of more \"conventional\" songwriting and instrument use. Love and Revolution was the most explicitly \"message\"-oriented and political. This is a tough record to peg, so maybe trying is besides the point. Nigel Ayers is a pretty smart egg -- check out his Network News for some real quasi-Fortean fun -- so what comes off the disc seems at first glance incredibly doctrinaire and stodgy. \"Cops, lawyers and journalists [hey...!] are lying dead all around. There's no one left to judge us. Their iron facade has rusted!\" he sings on Power of Love (Bring Power to its Knees), and you get the impression that he's pitching the whole thing so that the people who will take it straight will take it straight and the people who will consider it a tongue-in-cheek piss-take will take it as exactly that. Which is either massively clever or an incredibly pathetic dodge -- I'm still not entirely sure about that. But one thing I do know: put aside the politics, however middle- or no-brow they may be, and what you have here is one extremely neat piece of no-budget sonic rabblerousing. The equipment used on the record is incredibly primitive -- the ramshackle sound makes it all the more lovable, actually -- but everything's used with care and intelligence, and each piece is made to matter. Ayers has said something to the effect that a toy instrument shoved through a massive PA can get better results than a $2,000 synth any day. I guess it all depends on who's doing the shoving, right?\nwww.thegline.com",

The twelces CD players in Soul Zodiac are arranged to align with the sequence of zodiac signs they represent.\nThis binaural recording was made from the centre of the Soul Zodiac sound system at the time of the Summer Solstice 21 June 2012.\nSoul Zodiac sound system specifications:\nDURABAND CD-39B Portable Radio with CD Player x 12\nChannels: 24 channels\nOptical pick-up: 36 beams lasar\nFrequency Response: 100Hz-16K Hz\nOutput Power: 1.5W x 24 (RMS)\nPower source: AC 230V ~ 50 Hz\nPower consumption: 13.5W x 12\nSpeaker impedance: 4 Ohms",

            "about": "Recorded in London Zoological Gardens, the Derbyshire Dales and various sites in Great Britain between January and May 1988.\nsee also  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nSpiritflesh includes drones, birdsong and other recordings of animals, percussion, effects. It is by no means the assault on your ears that industrial music is supposed to be***. I am sure that if you described those elements to most people they would dismiss it as new age cobblers. In fact, the album is incredibly involving... enveloping. I think this is because Nigel is able to combine the white light of ambience with a darker undercurrent, so the whole carries just enough weight and intensity. Too little and it would be cheesy in the same way that the whooshing positivity of trance is cheesy. Too much and we enter camp \"hammer house of horror\" cliches or the outright nastiness of much of the industrial scene.\nI’m reluctant to get into a track by track dissection. The album sucks you into its own world but allows you the freedom to wander about. It is easy to forget that nobody else was producing music quite like this at the time, because so many people have been producing derivative versions ever since.\nJohn Eden\nUncarved",

The glut of his ‘band’s prolific history has generally been a full-scale assault upon the senses, via either dingy slabs of noise or near-pretty industrial musique concrete. Stoneface operates on many levels, a set of gruelling, scraping, yet strangely attractive organic sounds that reveal numerously coloured layers with successive listens.\nRecorded in 1988, these sonic morsels play with near-baroque tendencies, devolved factory rhythms, spiritual solemnity and lucid minimalism, sometimes gripping, sometimes forgettable, but never uninvolving. And, as has been the case with the recent wealth of Emissions releases, it’s best to observe Stoneface’s sacred experiments in one complete sitting, where Ayers can effectively work his art on you with your complete, undivided and willing immersion.\nDarren Bergstein\nI/E",

            "about": "see  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nFor almost two decades Nigel Ayers as Nocturnal Emissions has maintained a singular iconoclastic vision, to produce music that is innovative and challenging. He has survived the \"Industrial era\" that produced a spate of visceral recordings (no doubt leaving many listeners with hearing impairments), been sampled by Afrika Bambaata and The Soul Sonic Force, moved to the solitude of the Derbyshire countryside and composed moments of sheer beauty and reflection and has been embraced by performance dance troupes. Each album has broken new ground and Sunspot Activity is no exception. Ayers makes no attempts to disguise the unashamedly lo-tech conception of the sound sources used: the crackle and distorted drift of a vinyl run-out groove, bursts of reverse loop bells and chimes, fractured electronic layers of the analogue kind and snatches of cosmic radio frequencies all merge seemlessly to create a hypnotic and tangibly coherent night-time soundtrack.\nRobert H. King\nVariant\nNocturnal Emissions' Sunspot Activity (Solielmoon Recordings) is brilliant. Track 2, \"ii\" is addictively dreamy with a nightmarish occasional screech of metallic sound over its distant melody. The LP reminds me of that dreamlike, anaesthetic state, where the sounds you hear dredge up from memory - lost distant melodies funnelled through present disturbances and clinks. We've all been there.\nCarolina Pulse",

            "credits": "released January 1, 1997\nThe essence of bagpipes is their drones: pushing breath through a series of reeds with tremendous force. Ayers plays with the sound of the drones (artificially slowing down or speeding up the passage of the \"air\"), and with the meaning of a drone (Does it have so be a note or group of notes? Can it be a repeated rhythmic pattern?).\nSome of these tracks have new drones added to the sound of the bagpipes - barely perceptible electronic hums, or gentle mechanical noises that distinctly don't belong to the world of wood and cloth. Passages played on the chanters are looped and turned into cycling constants; one set of drones crossfades into another; the instrument's overtones are separated from their context, and presented on their own. After a few tracks, the piping no longer has the connotations of its original instrument - it's just a human and ancient sound.\nRobin Edgerton and Douglas Wolk\nCMJ New Music Report",

I've unscrambled it  It gave out a faint high pitch squeal,  it oooohed and ohhhhhed.  I could hear the odd doof! then crack!,  then prooh!  A pffft -  whack, whack whack - the thudding boop, boop, boop  a doo, doo, doo, doo, boop, boop, boop, boop. He went, 'Urrhh, yeah, yeah,'  And then he went,' Urrrhhh! hurrh!. The little man twitched at the sound  and not worrying about the scrunching noise,  jumped the machine  to different tracks on the disc.   What they'd recorded before  had been a great deal of static.  They hired the very best technicians,  just to be certain that it sounded right.  It was too neat, but who the hell cares? It was quiet again,  in the centre of the town,  on the ground face down.  With a liquid foam,  the clothes, the shoes, the skin,  and the boneheaded.  Sag from the sky  leak through cracks in the floors  above the length and the width.  Never heavy enough, A coat of paint absorbed the light,  which never seemed to get brighter  and inch-thick sheets.  A stupid place to fall asleep. Now with a stiff upper drip,  I checked the slow insidious rain  could be heard or felt  by someone on a layer of pasteboard trailers,  shacks, sheds, and lean-tos,  A hundred thousand fibreglass people  topped with tarpaulin,  strung end to end  block after block of sheds  lighted windows glowed,  littering the insulate,  epitomised the English,  that sort of cold, wet rain.  Suddenly he saw the motorcyclist,  a hurtling beacon or something  blinded him for a moment,  his eyes misted  over.  And then he had to ram it with his bus,  sending the Jeep back  across onto the opposite pavement.  The wind cut through his bulky clothing  as he crossed in front of the car,  away from the headlights and the front wheels,  lifting his bus to140 kilometres per hour and completely off the ground  before flipping and rolling  and spinning off the road.  At the same time as the car screeched and ripped  the door slammed.  And he saw the passenger hurtle  on a diagonal course for the opposite ditch  and the car accelerated towards them  skidding, then righting itself  in a perfectly replicating sequence.",

But the electromagnetic energy resists analysis.'  The hesitation was repeated three times  as was the uncertainty of the printout  produced by the instruments therein. It takes about a year  of rising and falling telluric current to write each audio imaging voice on the dust screen,  a simple series of jagged spikes and troughs  print out on the microwave band.  Yes, the first one of them was filled  with tightly kinked hair fibres in 1957.  That's right, the noise of a rotating light  could be used to build an enhanced image  from the mirrors embedded on the columns of brown hair.  We finally settled on a system of stacked dark hair  covered in sand and glue.  But in order to fuse the printouts  to coat composite photos  were 25 fistfuls of slimy anodised mud. There were two TV sets  that flashed an array of synthetic hair images.  Elegant coloured lines about 60 feet long,  partially obscured by the aqua green mist  of the lights from the underground  with more than enough material  for the first several lines of sweating,  chilled, shaking, dazed, realistic,  and indifferent dream images,  crackling in a rhythmic alternating current. Old cigarette packets, sweet wrappers and discarded toys  overflowed down his chin  dripped into his shirt front the way lager still foamed out of the public house.  All the serious drinkers who had arrived at twelve  were into lager and lime in double quick time.  I remember the pub didn't have stools.  The bar was lined with little detectives,  hooked to a brass rail that ran along the bottom.  That was the only way to avoid trouble.  The room seemed dark,  the landlord, a blurred figure,  polishing glasses behind the bar,  a task which appeared to demand intense concentration.  The latecomer toasted himself,  gulping the lager so fast  that the frothy head overflowed  into a small puddle on a record player. The damn thing switched.  from 33 RPM to 45  vibrated on his brains.  Some of the beer fell into his watch.  A cheese roll was suddenly flushed  out of the interior of his shirtsleeve it slid onto the bench next to him,  uncomfortably close.  At one o'clock he unfolded a sheet of paper  and put it on the bar. I need somebody to help me. I'd only take up five or ten minutes of your time.  The man behind the bar, nodded  reached behind a couple of glasses  and put a heavy manilla envelope on the bar.  The walls were covered with heavy eyebrows.  That's the way it had been since 1954,  some old brass key fobs hanging from the beams,  bearing the date. The barman's making sure  none of the others in the other room look relaxed,  a glass in one hand, dish cloth paused  in an atmosphere of meaningless jumble.  Someone, maybe even one of the office workers,  bowed a cassette player from the elongated space.  The rain continued to pour for almost an hour.",

So, I suppose, you know,  that the elevator was still there, where it had left me in the old days.  When I first learned to hunt for ley lines   and memorize all sixty-four characters.  Yeah, in these rucksack dreams,  the symbol card catalogue system. I swung away from the mic  and looked at that literate gorilla  while he sent down for whole buckets  of fiery red angels.  Oh no, no.  They were not marked or damaged,  but they might have been,  he probably radioed the discharge  of radiation-like energy through card files.  I didn't find out any more.  A layer of sixty-four bit zero point noise music  dissolved into a crashing solid blare. The volume built up like a wave.  Yeah.  In a sequence that jigsawed haphazardly together across a bare, tiled interior,  Everybody stood still for a moment  caught in it they swayed back and forth.  Each person murmuring in Greek Sanskrit, Celtic,  dozens of men and women everywhere  talked crap about the printed word. And in a few seconds,  the force was growing larger  as the rumble grew.  Rose up everywhere into the darkness.  And sometime later  wailed a slight background sound  a faint rumble before the last reverberations ricocheted off  back into the large tunnel and stopped. Silence!  There was a pool of vomit under the window  and more vomit crusting  on a mass of telex equipment,  phones and electronic calculators. The whole setup in there, actually.  All the devices and a hundred others.  All those poncy rich kids.  Computers won't work.  It was a man next door  with a gust of something stale, networked to a recycling timer  of exactly once every ninety minutes,  this one was a minimum setup  to rid the place of ghosts.  The old agent got a geological survey map. The ley line hunter, looking for cutaways  that would put the event firmly into place, needed mirrors of the present  and grease and sand to throw on it.  He stopped, he hesitated a moment  then shrugged and his eyes shut  a couple of feet from the geological survey map,  naked, surrounded with empty mugs, fumbling along,  stepped back  towards the hi-fi stack in the corner, the wooden desk,  the pair of chairs and the coat rack,  his fist opening.  He seemed to be looking for markers.  It was very delicate work,  a tap dripped, a nd there was a low whirring from the fridge.  The telex machine typed out a message.  He took a step backwards.  He rapped at the door.  He reached into a rucksack  and pulled out a little screw adjustable magnifier. With a few slaps and jabs  and hammering and pounding, a prolonged period of hyperventilation faces flow through the view finder.",

A shot sounded  only a couple of streets away  running feet could be heard then an attacking force of plate glass windows  seemed to burst open inside my brain. Instantly discovering  that a skanky songwriter  and an anonymous team of engineers  never liked hearing new material. But there was something else doing my head in  shrivelling slowly in memory  tumbling to its knees on the ground,  somewhat vexed where there really isn't such a place left any more ,  where to hear rather than to feel  since whether in fact we were juicy  and fell to the ground  sugaring together weekly lit  by a light from the first floor. She enabled cryptographers  to leave her their pop anthems.  Oh yes.  That means ciphered the stairs  with over two dozen files.  Having correctly guessed  the difference between many bridges  for a hypothesised model of interaction.  Jack pressed a key on his laptop  and slid his prick up her.  Music filled the room,  the engine immediately turning. Pushing between them  firing bursts, not known consciously by the dreamer.   Got up from the sofa  and managed to throw his hands out  to heave the large hockey bag  full of ignition keys a few inches  With a crash, he slammed his foot on the video about hardcore drug abuse.   Bloody hell, but I need to escape. It was beyond cruel, this. The speaker-phone behind a locked front door,  exploded outwards,  a split second before he fell through  several hundred dermatological orifices,  like hair follicles across the street,  Her titties swung  beneath the row of buttons.  The tape played like the rest of them.  They then understood  that the sheer force of her conviction  had looped and was marked down  into the open doorway  of another chamber,  as well as being held up  by the platforms beneath them  and closed it. I pointed this out  and  proved it  to little goggled-eyed tight buttocks.  No doubt  they've already forgotten  to watch him transform  the last lingering busload  of potentially hard cock  down the romantic lines  of the main vertical shaft beyond it.  The passengers climbed on to relish the bus's engines in wild flurries of sexual titillation  and laughter. We could spread this  into a more bilateral look  at the wide concrete chasm in front  of the ring of bluestones  on the clitoris bundle.  It's all there.  You know, you must join us to think of something square,  no gimmicks, no time to lose.  The sooner we get moving  before the sprawling engine  directs itself right out of the middle lane  and into the red, white, and blue front entrance. Reaching under his seat.  The driver pushed,  folded, clicked, adjusted,  humming  using his smile and his eyes  and with his hands straight up  baton-twirled a screwdriver.  Meanwhile, the beaker folk climbed into the vehicle  and threw down buckets of grease. The engine was reassembled  and the device was levered  from one side and then back  dropped down the vertical shaft on the driver's side Back inside the cross vent first,  then rocking back and forth  out of the loop to a sudden halt in the correct position  over the supporting columns  down, up and down",

Now everything was slow motion,  they fishtailed crazily,  skidding off across the ruts,  mounting the grass verge.  Coming down so slowly,  into an ocean jam-packed with marine life.  There was a brief, strained pause,  a cloud of huge fish-type things  sat on the silty floor,  perfectly still.  A few seconds passed,  he listened to a faint rattling sound  gradually building to a  prang, a second prang,  and then a bass drum was tapping ominously, a slow, steady rhythm thrumming and pounding,  a tighter, off-beat rhythm,  and eventually a few notes thrummed on koto strings  held in and slowly increased,  a noise like a ferocious short circuit – krrrrrrrk –krrrrrrrk –krrrrrrrk –krrrrrrrk – and the music suddenly turned mean.  It went pwhhhoohhh! mphhhh!  They struck the beams and disrupter pulses,  kicking out blooms of dusky ripples.   The darkness around them intensified,  their trajectories shimmered sharply  to send out long streamers a hundred metres  directly above the wormhole generator.  His secure priority connection collapsed, fogged by the dense gases.  External sensors were showing the routing on the link,  which did nothing to relieve the growing ache. I sighed.  Some time later, in a vain attempt to alleviate the throbbing, I rubbed a hand across the safety webbing hat dropped out of a series  of large interlocking hemispheres that were slipping across the counter.  There are five large storage shelves,  but that is all.  He’d memorised the complete file,  that was a start.  At first, he was worried  about how much evidence  the vacuum had already cleared away.  Russian-made metal fatigue,  with messages from space.  When the screens on the tightly curved,  nearly horseshoe-shaped tabletop came to life  at 7:59:59,  she found herself listening to a thousand minds. The harsh blue hue  the two dozen computer screens  was now a flood of changing colours  which were the faces and clothes  of everyone in the biosphere  on all levels,  the release of tension was palpable  and seemed to repeat itself once  Twenty-five seconds  we have a medium-sized set of rebounding signatures  from screen to screen.  There’s something down here  hooked to a well-known paperback novel. They reached the stairway,  and saw the starlight  and the distant glow of street lamps.  These beards and guitars flashed messages  of subliminal behaviour modification  into the open doors of the train,  the subconscious sees  and absorbs the resultant image.  Thankfully, his sunglasses offered some protection.  The phone beeped  a few grains of rust-coloured stuff that was coming through in gusts  settled into the folds of his sleeve  and started decades of wear and tear,  those clothes would be wrecked.  Two cables ran from a battery-powered radio clamped to the boiler ledge,  facing the wooden crates in the control room .  He climbed on top of the bed, and began flicking through the reference pages  until at last he had the full message.  He dropped back onto the bed  his eyes wide,  before he managed to eat through the fabric  that would not come off his bed.  One third was pieces of dry, brittle leaves  littered not only with coal dust  but with loosely packed sand and gravel.  Yellow grains were pages,  composed of two types of sand.  He jotted down words,  torn wrappings that could be decrypted  from the abrasive sand  with smudges of numerical oil  and unravelling decades of soot  to get something they could use  from the coded communication.  The pre-War noise encryption standard  had a rusting main rod,  with a blackening connecting rod,  and a leaky rheostat  turned all the way down.  When it is projected on a screen,  the screen appears to shake and grind  for a few seconds.  But it will not take long to compose the message.  Finally, the algorithm was firmly implanted into his brain.",

                    "lyrics": "Line Noise Warm and softly lit,  the big room smelled of defiance  and black leather trousers.  There was an old man on a bench  at the far end,  he was just sitting there,  in baggy jeans and a sweater,  holding sawdust  carbon dioxide  faint sounds of tape-recorded jazz mutter  tensed his body,  shuffling the muscles together.  His hands his feet  large and broad,  she recognised the tension  his ridiculous jealousy.  But she relished the sweaty rock gigs,  and the thrill of being  amongst a number of individuals  who would soon merge  into one heart and mind,  fused by the crowd’s lust for pleasure,  But this was no ordinary rock band.  They had aged with breath-taking swiftness,  growing jowls,  turning grey and then white, they could have been a single body  but for the protruding awkwardness of their legs.  Years later,  Mike tried to remember his first emotions,  the prominence of her nipples,  jumping up and down  with stamping feet and loud whistling.  That press of bodies all around,  the screams through the thin mist of night. I grabbed the flash-light from the glove compartment.  A raucous rhythm rattled out. Beneath my fingers  curves and crevices of her body  were spasmodically pressing against me  in a plain language of desire.  She hardened, her body twitching “This is dragsville, man,”  she sighed, squeezing her eyes shut.  Outside the afternoon had suddenly become light.  The rain running down  and saturating her second-hand clothing.  almost totally disembowelled buildings  and piles of rubber .Remorsefully, she added,  “You know something, mister?  Two years ago I was a girl in a pair of horns,  Spock-shaped ears and legs wide  to give her eager lovers free access.” They were gutter punks trained in countless street brawls  and the kind of predators  who were turning the city into one throbbing,  thrusting love-machine,  every part working in harmony. “Amazing,” said Mike, truly amazed.  Flicking first one erect nipple and then the other.  He increased the pressure on her love-bud and intoned. “Try Channel Eight.”  “Sieg hiel, mein Fuhrer!” “Don’t let the stars get in your eyes.” “Come on love, it’s a cold night.” He realised too late that he had made a mistake.  Then there was silence.  Line noise from the occasional street lamps,  coughing and spitting onto long strings of beads. His eye stung with sweat.  The city thundered, vile and cloying,  involuntarily gargling,  drowning, meshing in an infinite gloom. She was a small, thin girl,  her face pale  as though some giant leech was feeding on her  in the neon lights. And above it all was the music.  Emboldened by the sound,  life would be a circular autodialler,  an exclusive design,  a blob of cream on a rug of artificial grass and no mucking around There is line noise probing pressure and vibration  blowing away the minds of millions Now there was silence  but for the shrill piping  caused by a problem in the telephone line.  And somewhere a bird of some kind was hooting,  human breathing,  digestion, the shifting of bodies,  distant sounds from the darkness,  speaking with a strange accent and a wet lisp. Each person’s eyes are closed  as he smells the one object  and takes a pinch  of each of the other two items  for applications to every orifice. Press the Return key  for a final interlocking answer.  Building to the point  where three possible explanations  stirred the folds  of the newly privileged demolition crews.  Her white dress was stained  with a beautiful symmetry,  name and password,  decay and death,  the shadows getting closer,  the sweat of her frustration  dabbled in her labia  and her brown arms glistened.  Bend your left leg,  grasping a bad telephone.  Painted on tendered parts  marijuana and incense  and an amber disc rimmed with gold,  spiralling towards  displayed on her broad forehead,  the high-boned cheek,  her whole body shrieks.  But she had beads –  the shining box  that might have belonged  toher great-grandmother.  I felt suddenly gripped  by the distant rumble of line noise  that grated on her dying nerves.  As I sit fully relaxed and breathing deeply,  visualising my left hand,  I feel it move imperceptibility somewhere between your computer  and the other computer. The structure,  snake-tail red, floating gently,  gets lighter and lighter. It rises slowly from my lap toward my face I know that when it touches my face  burned out flashbulbs may not be everybody’s cup of tea.  Behind me the sirens screamed to a stop and the bright astral body  gliding in the form of a human limpet  had learned to Frug and do the Monkey. Green with the redhead  and black with the God knows what.  I stayed on the telephone for three more hours.  Darkness had fallen  and the street lights  were throwing a menacing lens  changing images, amber letters,  trembling patterns  and between them a thick pall falling. Smell the artificial flowers  that winked like molecules  that are connected by electrical forces  to dust that can’t be swept,  vacuumed or beaten.  Follow directions,  thrill to erotic chastisement.  Discuss the temperature  of the pink latex mini-dress, the heartbeat of the dead saint  with fire in his guts and brimstone in his soul,  and then, if symptoms persist,  press the Return key.",

Oak leaves.  Again, he changed  this time to create surplus flesh  on his lean body.  His fingers shook slightly when others mentioned the bugs with long feelers,  a stop light goes on for self security, he is aggressive  Hundreds, perhaps thousands of flux pods  were making their way  seizing the spray  far up a few hundred yards above the street lighting  closer to the wall.  It's true.  That is where they come from.  And the other things up the river  over a time variant  over fifteen hours,  like leaves before the wind  looking down  perfectly still  His ears breathing  gingerly grasped the edge of the hatch, hit it with a few small charges, a stimulating effect,  and the lights thrust,  and the action had secrets  twenty-seven on her labia  and a thick one was being applied to her clitoris.  So she decided to bide her time  for the time being at least.  But something surely was doing things  to his intuition, intelligence and wisdom. The second girl now approached him  A naked girl,  holding a handful of powder to the Southeast,  to the sodden forest below.  About ten years back,  the idols of old,  the false floppy discs were prolific. The hiss heralded a menacing step forward  around and around.  What noise was unscrewed or pulled out for? For Heaven is dusted  with a bit of fat bottom rubble,  the ancient text messaging word patterns,  the grace of the children of the film cartridge.  I'll be shopping for the intelligentsia.  Greens into a riot of colour  across cryptographers smoking cigarettes,  bow down the wall,  profitable in business. Certain of themselves  it's designed that way.  Never went to the out fringes,  a row of metals across  one thousand two hundred bowed nipples. They stole it from his hands.  Paralysed from action by giant cryptographers,  hoarding stolen ingots Storage banks.  Your trust, isn't it kind of cold?  No, I haven't.  You would think that I don't blame you. You're not the first  at the same time.  I've told the best friend,  an imperfect child,  whatever  the motley assortment  of two or three dozen in the same place,  grown from the tangled wreckage  What's going on? He's alone.  Books were scattered all over.  He was going to get swamped  frowned on.  On the far wall,  a patch of red light and useless decorations,  secret photographs,  pain sounds pleasure sounds  meant nothing. From the window of the office,  I looked down  and the streaming rain ran rusted guttering,  turning to powder.  At the end of the line slates had blown  heavy rainfall sprayed.  Levered aside the stones pounded demolished houses.  Peeled off dragging  bobbing minivans along the water,  surged back and forth  smashed dancers took running dives and began to writhe  in a deep sea of leathery animals. Genitals  objects  faces that meant nothing  tossed large slabs of stone  falling with bits of soil and sea everywhere.  Overflowed dropped drowning.  Birds, guts, flowers, rats, and mice,  golden grave goods,  a length of splintered branch,  human limbs, hunter, and hunted  mixed deeper, and deeper,  so deeply.  And he waited for it to subside. And start a pattern  to cause a shape to be formed  high enough to stand in like a fortification,  like thirty feet of cement chamber  that reeked of bones and body odour  Along one side, there was a soggy flap.  It dripped its earthly grime  somewhat like a massive fountain pen.  At the other end, there was what appeared to be a tiny square lens. I'm checking to see  that the plate is secure.  Things didn't look too good.  They're whispering.  Clothes will not be worn  while the computers take over.  I kicked the door open.  Tiny particles of dust drifted upward  Inside was an enormous protective web  clogged with shit  ancient shit.  beatnik shit.  If I yelled,  it got stuck in my throat. I turned away and as I turned  polycarbonate phlegm filtered the sunlight  beaming in through the windows.  I moved forward  barefooted in the wreckage  that rose five stories  wooden crates filed in spirals  looked as if they had been standing there for years,  A wash basin, jig steps,  and the oddball characters  attract many flies coughed up memories of the old ones.  Thousands prowl the laboratory  it's on the map and in the vocabulary,  a sleeping animal fog drifted across the street  river fog, slurring social strata.  Different levels of wealth,  races, languages, and cultures,  the elements whipped,  the powdered grime and thorny tentacles,  moss  and dandelions  an ant's eye view  is not the only point of vantage Up close the buildings were even more grey and damp.  Windows and doors were securely shuttered silent,  total silence  to the noise,  to the sound.",

He thought he heard clapping and shouting.   He seemed to be listening underwater.  The noise of wind and rushing  and the blood pounded in his ears. Outside thunder fell out of the sky  with a muffled bass thump  from passing car speakers. Murmured voices,  sheep bells,  jangled in the distance. There was movement and noise everywhere.  Formless static became clear voices  speaking in a foreign tongue  before the rotor noise drowned them.  And then with a loud  metal-on-metal tat-tat-tat-tat-tat  Then abruptly,  there came a loud boom  thump-thump,  blaring air horns and shouting. Then two loud, puncture-like booms echoed out,  reverberating off the walls.  The noise of police sirens, the slowing swish of a car,  the rotor noise SHOOOOOOM!! Thawump! Thawump! Thawump! Thawump! Thawump!  Tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat a humming sound and a groaning clatter  corrugated tin rattled,  a scratching sound,  Ka-chunk! Zzzzzzzzz! people yelling  the window rattled,  someone knocked,  the telephone rang  the high voice crackled through the speaker  with the odd sentence of English.  Shush.  What was that?  What was what?  I heard it. Something I didn't hear anything.  Our map showed a line of pylons  running across to the four rectilinear columns  set in the middle of the curve. It would've been easy going  travelling in a straight line,  like a waterfall. Rain drummed on the outside window  and hundreds of tiny engines  were painted glistening white  in the same fashion.  The sounds of two TV sets  rushed down into wide body of water.  They emerge inside the ravine  somewhere where space is being twisted. When I get the scene done Anyway,  perhaps a dozen even larger television monitors squeeze through the gap  for six hours today,  between the hours of three o'clock  and nine o'clock this morning.",

Your starter button  grappling hook and high-powered magnet  located under the driver’s seat.  I can see it now You are easily flattered as your ego is so fragile and flaky.  Your strong need for rock’n’roll  means a singularity, With your prick out,  wanking into the microphone of solid  matter  on the far side of a sheet of glass  just after dawn and eighty feet straight down.  Shot your bolt onto the floor.  Staring at the screen,  He squinted to see it sink to its resting place, a negative void nearly two hundred feet below.  Like magic, everything fell into place,  barefoot, uncaring into the crack on the video recorder I thought,  my God, she really likes it! Whatever she felt,  my little weapon was not adverse to her plump pubis.  But within ninety seconds  Ping!  Total organ failure.  The situation was extremely fluid  and instantly went limp  dripping over her.  A tiny tremor.  “Oh, shit,”  But… Dark Sun grasped my penis and wanked it furiously.  I whimpered in agony.  Holy shit.  First with one, two handgrips on my love machine,  a flaming erection.  I felt the circulation surge  I was nearly ready to shoot.  After weeks of nosing round the congested streetscape  of ruined buildings, squats, bedsits and anti-matter,  motorway services, city blocks passing in a blur.   Through the metal handles,  thin rectangular conduits  a big widescreen TV,  wire-rim glasses.  He slouched and sniffed. Little juicy twots,  smoke trails,  custard powder,  a crystal ball,  his arm,  his hands,  his bum,  the café,  unlocked conversations,  the game plan,  the hopeful glimmer,  the shrieking siren, groans of delight,  bright-red posters,  teaching notes. He tasted spray tan boxer shorts jeans and vomit. He kept checking his phone.  Checked the piece of paper  his contact at the university had sent him.  He was about to turn away  when he noticed that the door  was now revealed  as a nerve mound  of stone and plaster  that mainly emanated from her body.  Squinted his eyes to focus his frown.  A stack of rock that grew to incredible size in a local nipple landmark, imprisoned between my thumb  and folding realities of video pre-production  silhouetted against the sticky light from inside.  Six sisters, six. He was sitting, one leg on either side of her,  flapping his hands.  It was a machine here on Earth that is somehow removed.  It is lowered onto the remainder  resting on the stacked boards  we lower it just as we raised it,  and this time,  sealed it between them.",

Like the one I noted  on the components in more accessible locations  at the administrative centre,  all around the elevator   in the bottom third cubicle against the touch pad.  The counterweight cables running down the wall  impacted on the series of vertical components  to switch three micro scrambled  neural energy barrels. These would be released almost instantly  and empty into the lowest aspects of this device but it involves bright yellow flashes  bursting forth to bounce this signal  back up to the main database  As you know,  the small and flexible parts  in the smaller version  work like an umbrella,  a hemispherical trap door bends it down. And then the radio chip signals lower that bass pattern.  Squinting against the gusts staring up at the mountains of colour monitors  behind the camp.

Don't worry he said There must be something caustic in the dust. In any case in a few minutes it would be eight o'clock.  Whatever the explanation,  it was a real life tragedy unfolding  in front of the familiar landscape.  Maybe the zoom lens on one of the CC TV cameras  operating in the bars and offices and homes around England  can predict its course or its consequences. I think we're making progress here.  We're not entirely certain, but  we believe that he's managed to set up a video link  to the piercings in the adolescent roundness of her belly.  Good work.  The pair of them looked off camera and nodded.  The two men were gazing at the photograph.  Maybe it was the fact that on Friday night,  any Friday night,  he could watch the best shots of a white river of headlights  bursting out of the cloud mass in the shopping precinct. Intercut with the other shopping precinct material,  a torrent of visceral images,  pissing on moral outrage.  The images came and went.  He played a few minutes worth of tape  over and over again.  Right now,  real babies were being monitored  by a gleaming galvanic skin glue  from the television sets. A leftwards pan on the camera,  cutting to a view of two old ladies clapping.  We keep moving a microwave signal,  suspending subatomic particles  in a mostly futile attempt to keep it clear of rain.  I'm surprised they managed to land  without starting a preliminary scan  of the medulla oblongata  sited in the brains of. dogs and chimpanzees.  Respiration and cardiovascular activity information  was available to access  designating their vector as a purple line, bearing down to the brown land, . Perhaps, theoretically,  even so he couldn't imagine  what some of the equipment was designed to do.  When the computer came to life displaying a single line of text,  vulnerable inner ears received a heavy buffeting,  it fired up a buckling wave of nausea. There's no way the standard set of resources  amass that kind of potential.  Apparently it's initialising a low level response in eight thousand devices  spitting off a lot of amber scintillations  down across the circle  of commercial buildings and warehouses.  Catastrophic material failure can be ugly  even in a remote location. The system produced a mild electric charge.  We don't know if cracks propagated in some rather critical locations  received simple binary codes  that were eating into the smart core in the generator building.  They're lucky that the equipment  didn't seem disturbed by the command prompt.  We need to anticipate all possibilities. That's why the technical team  make air breathing cell coated wires  that are able to pull  enough useful information out of it.",

There's some files about a limp white thing  covered with algae,  blocking this signal to the council buildings.  The water weed barrier machine  had once stood seven feet high and twenty feet wide.  It dates back to the dark ages.  The machine stood for centuries  before it emptied itself out.  It was a much bigger aqueduct cavity  that lolled to one side,  exposing a rippling void,  the distant splash of a disengaging wormhole. It marked a near ten mile long primeval water torrent  that had been built to run a rudimentary database  made out of bones.  It would be filled to the brim with oceans  to form oceans.  There would be hundreds of technicians  brought in to watch the deluge.  We have little understanding of the mechanisms they used  and psychologists babble  a bit too fast for me to follow. There are too many voices.  There is still a way to play it.  A few minutes later,  the scientists flipped the light switch,  opened the first page and pointed to a diagram  of local trade routes.  This huge fiery figure  held a microphone expertly  in front of him.  We have to surface, he said,  Are you sure it's on? I say, I have run three different scans  thinking of all the scientific questions. then three more running another program,  but sometimes it's a struggle.  I've not been able to study them.  I will endeavour to bring them back with me.  Two of my books are actually missing  for my study  in broad daylight.  I've seen them wheeling about  and breaking free into the upper air beyond  I asked him what he meant  his voice on the mic a dull murmur. He kept opening and closing his mouth  trying to speak.  Oh, no, no, no.  He was shaking.  When it was over,  he realized he had forgotten to press record.  No, no, no.  Some of the cars pulled off the tarmac  and onto a cow track  that stretched out  towards the green hilly countryside.  There were razors all over.  They chucked their debris out of the car,  crushed milk cartons and shielded boxes. The column of protestors began to shuffle forward.  Thousands of people  cramming into disused warehouses  in abandoned scrubland.  The CCTV control room had been destroyed.  And now it made sense.  What do you think then? This was about trespass in a muddy field. These were the beginnings of the strongest dynamic ideas and people,  tons of equipment had to be trucked in secretly  complicated pieces of kit,  weathered computers,  and a mutual proximity breaker switch,  an intricate web,  working with molecules  towards the front of the demo.  There were ways of sending a message.  The signal arrived  right there on the cow track  was the name of a local building firm: No romance, no passion, no joy.  The driver sat in the driver's compartment,  hands on the copper adze single frame video coverage  moved with a little gurgling noise  and with surprisingly smoother smoothness he bent forward.  Peering at the screen, Magnetic Herbie sat beside him,  the heat blistering his skin, grunted.  The camera grabbed every two seconds,  it recorded a sharp fragment of machinery the size of a man's fist.  It was only a mirage,  but we can rebuild this machine.  He saw many mirages before he reached the woodland,  then spotting a gap,  toes scuffing the powdery sand,  he rejoined the march.",

We clipped them  we were going to see one hundred and seventy-four minutes  of the material that had been shredded.  That’s what we enhanced,  taped together to form a panorama.  The muddy tape had weighed one hundred and thirty-five pounds.  It’s shot from inside the machine Of course, when viewed from inside the machine, the yellow markers lose resolution.  Of the ninety-five dots on the screen,  sixty were green, the rest were red  and strips of green-and-red neon lights  flashed in a tight grid sodden with water.  She examined the murky images  and sighed as she picked up one of the metal strips out of a lever on a geared mechanism made up of little dots.  The resolution was too poor  to give us a coherent swirl  of ten thousand pixels. She watched the knots of dark curly hair  attached to the large wheel  that carried the strip of metal.  Look, this one has a whole string of markings,  but the one that was on the bottom  only has a thin film of loose dust on it.  When we blow up the images on the tape,  they get blurry.  Now those things have vanished into the oily water.",

Dawn came every day,  but we just don't know it.  No one answered,  but she crept along the side of it  in between smooth, rubber waves  to find out how far you'll fall.   From  that enormous mound of sand  that formed her name  with three inch thick foam covered boards. The light from above there  now touched the pavement  teeming with one hundred and twenty-seven pedestrians.  He sat absolutely still.  And he thought of the beach  as the beeping noise continued. . His hands went to his mouth.  The rotting tongue and lips  were teasing and licking  as electric tingles shot through his brain, but he came back again and again. The air struck him in the face,  too hot to breathe.  He didn't make a sound.  He took a deep breath,  smiled and gestured.  His bare skin was warm against the portable radio.  He scratched his neck and all at once  swung away from the apparition  and opened  the screen behind him. But he couldn't see,  and he stumbled down some sort of long,  long thread of electronic vomit. People with long hair, bushy hair absorb the signal.  But the metal had suddenly become red hot.  He saw steel-grey mountains and lush green neurological energy  straighten out the familiar features. He ran down the stairs to the dumpster,  leaving safety.  Leaving a five foot high glowing object  that had just pulled from the black and grey striped sheets. Glass fragments were scattered across the bedspread. Noise had  to be kept to a minimum,  no-one can touch and feel a mirage.  Embracing a switch that caused different images to be displayed on the concrete wall, there was a wet gurgling noise  and suddenly the beeping stopped.",

            "about": "The World is my Womb was recorded in Three Houses in South London between September 1986 and July 1987. First issued in England in 1987 by Earthly Delights (Earth 002)\nsee also  www.earthlydelights.co.uk\nAn early example of the spiritual ambient-trance music Nocturnal Emissions' affinity for ancient folk songs adds a distinctive accent to the music's ritualistic grandeur.\nThe World Is My Womb comes from the beginning of their \"NEotantic\" style, pursued on later releases Spiritflesh (1988) and Invocation of the Beast Gods (1989). Nigel Ayers and his longtime partner Caroline K were then making quasi-ceremonial music, after their founding noise and band-oriented albums.\nIn music and spoken word pieces Sealing A Phase, Vegetation Narration, and Blended Senses Nigel Ayers (rather seriously and dryly) spelled out his new age philosophy - part gnostic holistics, part tantric imagery - while staying traditional when borrowing religious Church Of England signifiers (organ sounds and liturgical chants) on tracks like Clear Bells and the prayer-sampling Lighten Our Darkness.\nMixing the old with the new is also the feel of Jangled Senses where a simple piano melody recalls an old time hymn, while ringing bells signal something more revealing.",

            "about": "Presenting the latest collaboration of Nigel Ayers (Nocturnal Emissions), PBK, and Allan Zane (WYRM, Nihilist Assault Group), recorded in 2023.\nLegendary artists and great collaboration. Experimental, meditative and deep ambient music. A requiem and hymn for all humans and souls.\nThe title “This home stands on ancient bones” reminds us that our present world is built upon a history of all that has gone before. Compassion, contrition, repentance – all te layers of emotions that rise from the surface of the earth – mingle and drift through the emptiness, existing all around us. This powerful work captures and embodies these emotions, serving as both a requiem and a hymn to humanity across time – past, present and future.",

            "about": "First released in 2000.\n\"There's no suggestion of this being chemical as in spacey and tripped_out. It seems more like some horrendously toxic product that has either been withdrawn from legal usage, or is used only as a last resort to treat the few conditions worse than its side effects.\nAlthough there are a few drum and bass flourishes, the odd techno moment, none of this is done by conventional means. If drum and bass is Manet, Transgenic are Picasso. Most of these tracks use rhythm as a foundation, but not as a rhythmic foundation, if you see what I mean. The beats seem to be there in order to focus the listener's attention, which, once fully engaged, will inevitably notice that although the drum programs may be along for the ride, there's no-one driving.\nLike many greats, this seems to have evolved under its own volition, unstructured by conscious human intervention. What with the grinding non-sequiteurs of bass noise, the squeals and virtual clanks, all reproduced in high resolution sound, Transgenic is the sound of techno after the extinction of the human race, the machines keep churning out the beats and the bass, evolving into degraded forms with an incomprehensible agenda that is quite unrelated to keeping people in cycling shorts bouncing into the early hours of Sunday morning.\nI think this is a cracker, but then how could I possibly resist an album which features tracks called Oligonucleotide, Chromosome Sequence, and World Bank Schistosoma?\"\nWar Arrow\nSound Projector",

            "about": "A rhythmic urge, reminiscent of the loudest of discos, weaves throughout the proceedings as the typical barrage of sound crunches through on top.\nNE have taken their inaccessible best and thrown it into the melting pot with a set of pumping rhythms. The result is the frustrated son of mutant disco. That overused term has given birth to an even more mutated slant on the black American beat.\nMood music for the intelligently subversive, a chorus of tingling memories thrashing against that driving, never ending beat. But this is not sell out! No mere commercial alternative, just the opposite. NE use the accepted areas of the dance idiom and reshape the rules by introducing just about everything that, in theory, shouldn’t be there. If they’re dancing in hell, which I’m sure they are, it must be to music like this.\nDave Henderson\nSounds",
