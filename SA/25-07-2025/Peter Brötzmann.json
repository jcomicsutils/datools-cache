After 2017s Karacho! we now have the quintet with the unsurpassable Johns as it worked out that brilliant night of 2019! Edwards and Eckhardt did a warm up as a duett dedicated to the most beautiful legs on earth. Peter Brötzmann just know what sexuality has to do with the energy this group deals with! Listen also to the 15-minute-trio-interaction called Hot Ass!\nKurz nach dem Karacho! vom 7. Oktober 2017, welches die Erstbegegnung von Peter Brötzmann mit Christian Lillinger verzeichnet hatte, sicherte sich Oliver Schwerdt, vormals bekannt geworden als Elan Pauer, den Willen des legendären west-deutschen Saxofon-Schwerts zu, ein abermaliges Abenteuer im doppelt mit dem Doppelbass besetzten Quintett auszufechten. Nach dem er Luten Petrowsky neue Flügel verliehen hatte, scheint auch der Wuppertaler sich Schwerdts Fähigkeiten als fulminanten Turbolader für‘s Alter gern zu bedienen. Dem als Bambule! ausgewiesenen Hauptakt des 2019 realisierten Zweit-Treffens liegt wieder die sensationelle Aufwärmübung im Trio beiseite, dieses Mal in Anspielung an Brötzmanns Lobpreis der Sexualität Hot Ass/Beauty Legs geheißen: eine Viertelstunde Trio ohne Bass, plus Bass-Duo. Die Sternstunden des Free Jazz funkeln nochmal in ihren höchsten Tönen.",

You can buy it here:  www.euphorium.de/rubriken/records/biturbo.htm\nDESCRIPTION:\nOnce again EUPHORIUM sets another paradisian debut of musical collaboration: On October 7th 2017 Peter Brötzmann and Christian Lillinger are performing for the first time together. Biturbo!, Capt'n documents their first audible touch. EUPHORIUM mastermind Oliver Schwerdt had decided to continue working on the classical free jazz format of both a bass-less trio with reeds/piano/drums and an extension of that trio with a pair of double basses. While his companion since 2006, old-GDR-hero Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky retired in 2016, Schwerdt just hired Peter Brötzmann, the West-German counterpart, former friend and maybe ancient influencer of \"Luten\". The result is a complex of full forced energy struts and multiplied situations of filigreed sounds. The youngsters which do their bilateral exercices since 2006 really kick the old captain into a grand breath of the free jazz avantgarde.\nAls am 7. Oktober 2017 Peter Brötzmann das mit Ernst-Ludwig \"Luten\" Petrowsky aufgebaute Trio- und Quintett-Spiel (Höre vgl. EUPHORIUM-Records-Veröffentlichungen \"White Power Blues\" (2008), \"Short Night\" (2013) sowie das Doppel-Tryptichon \"Tumult!\"/\"Krawall!\"/\"Rabatz!\" (2013-15) bzw. \"Radau!\"/\"Rabatz!\"/\"Remmidemmi!\" (2015)) fortzusetzen sich anschickt, gestatte ich mir als Eröffnung des Abends, sowohl systematisch geschickt wie historisch informiert, die transparentere Interaktion im basslosen Trio-Format - Erstbegegnung Brötzmann und Lillinger! Es ist unfassbar, was sich da als Klassik des Free Jazz aktuell ausspricht. Schwerdt, der seinen Elan Pauer nun bürgerlich angemeldet hat, und Lillinger geben auf beiden Seiten, in ihrem Biturbo-Zauberstab, Dampf für den Alten, der sich als Kapitän die Mütze aufsetzt. Herzlichen Glückwunsch, dass es das noch gibt und geben darf! Hier, im Schwelgen von Körper, Feier, Kraft, Hymnus, Rhythmus, Tempo, Überschwang, feiert sich der Vitalismus selbst. Die diffizile Technik wird im gedrängten Gestus zur Kunst gemacht.",

Get that kick to the ultimate jazz ecstasy! \"Beauty Legs\" is called the recording of the first duo performance of the marvelous double bass players both called John, Edwards here, Eckhardt there.\nPeter Brötzmann hat sich im Umfeld seines 70. Geburtstages, namentlich auf Seite 147 des seine \"Gespräche\" mit Christoph J. Bauer dokumentierenden Bandes, die Bemerkung zuschreiben lassen, derzufolge die „Sexualität“ als „Urantriebskraft“ für den Musiker gelten mag. Eine diesbezüglichen Spuren nachforschende Studie würde bei immerhin 8 (!) Alben in Bezug auf deren Betitelung oder deren ,Cover‘-Gestaltung fündig werden: nach \"Nipples\" (1969), \"Balls\" (1970), \"Woodcuts\" (2008), \"Snakelust\" (2011), \"Long Story Short\" (2011), \"Mollie’s In The Mood\" (2012), \"I Am Here Where Are You\" (2013), zuletzt bei \"Sex Tape\" (2016). \"Hot Ass\" (2019) formuliert sich so als Anspielung des kundigen Musikhistorikers auf die fünfzigjährige Geschichte einer bestimmten Nomenklatur.\nDass Oliver Schwerdt, vormals Elan Pauer, seine klassischen Hardcore-Freejazz-Quintette mit basslosen Aufwärmrunden beginnt, ist spätestens seit der jenem 2013 mit Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky entfachten \"Tumult!\" vorgelagerten Mini-CD mit dem Titel \"Short Night\" bekannt. Nachdem EUPHORIUM Records die allererste Begegnung von Peter Brötzmann und Christian Lillinger, realisiert am 7. Oktober 2017 im legendären Leipziger Club NATO, \"Biturbo!\" getauft hat, und bei dem neben Lillinger Schwerdt selbst dem alten Kapitän sein hyperschallschnelles Ruder heranträgt, erscheint nun auch der Nachfolge der damaligen Quintett-Aufnahme (\"Karacho!\") mit einem Trio-Nachfolger. \"Hot Ass/Beauty Legs\" präsentiert mit \"Beauty Legs\" zudem die beiden Bassisten, die sich mit den basslosen Drei hernach zum Quintett vereinen werden, im Zweiklang ihrer tieftönenden Holzboote.

Oliver Schwerdt and Christian Lillinger continue their work producing a classical free jazz setting which they worked out with GDR superstar Ernst-Ludwig \"Luten\" Petrowsky (listen especially to EUPHORIUM Records releases Tumult!, Krawall!, Rabatz!) from 2006-16. Within the 2017's group Petrowsky is replaced by the West German equivalent Peter Brötzmann, another energy player from the founding father's generation of Free Jazz. And again we have the doubled position of the double bass: instead of Robert Landfermann who did the job within the Luten's quintet we can experience the work of John Eckhardt.\nSelbstverständlich hat Oliver Schwerdt nach der Einspielung des grandiosen Finales des Spätwerks von Ernst-Ludwig Petrowsky und dem nur wenig später durch gesundheitlichen Einbruch bedingten Scheiden des ost-deutschen Superstars aus dem Spiel des Free Jazz sogleich an eine Fortsetzung des seit 2011 aufgespannten Quintetts mit Lutens west-deutschem Pendant Peter Brötzmann, gedacht. Zu dem für den 7. Oktober 2017 verabredeten Konzert reist der als Pionier der Szene ‒ Brötzmann war bekanntlich der Saxofonist des ersten europäisch besetzten basslosen Trios ‒ zum Heros Stilisierte ausgerechnet aus Warschau, jener Stadt an, in der er 1974 noch einmal in der musik-instrumentalen Konstellation des Coltrane-Quartetts (S c h l i p p e n b a c h T r i o ohne Evan Parker mit Peter Kowald) einen legendären und heute über Youtube noch täglich fesselnd zu vergegenwärtigenden Auftritt absolviert hatte. In Leipzig warten jetzt gleich zwei Bassisten auf Brötz. Für den einen, John Edwards, hat Schwerdt gleich zwei Kontrabässe besorgt. Der Londoner kommt aus Moskau per Flugzeug und hat am Vorabend Evan Parkers Abendessen aufgegessen. Der andere John, Eck- hardts, kommt mit eigenem Bass aus Hamburg per Zug und kann sich an ein kurzes Date mit Brötzmann im E n s e m b l e M o d e r n erinnern. Während in Moskau das S c h l i p p e n b a c h T r i o sich anschickt die Bühne zu besteigen, hat auch Schwerdt als Startrampe für den Abend in Leipzig die basslose Trio-Konstellation gewählt: neben seinem historischen Bewusstsein mag zugleich die bei dieser transparenteren Instrumentierung erhöht zu erwartenden Interaktionsfrequenz entschieden haben. Es ist das erste Zusammentreffen von Christian Lillinger und Brötzmann. Dem Alten stehen zwei geschwinde Jungs zur Verfügung: nach einer Viertelstunde Biturbo!, Capt'n die beiden Johns hinzugerückt, bietet sich dem Publikum nach den 2013-15 mit Luten eingespielten Quintetten Tumult!, Krawall!, Rabatz! ein sagenhaftes Karacho!",

            "about": "‘Ears Are Filled With Wonder’, the debut release from the duo of pedal steel player Heather Leigh and reedist Peter Brötzmann, blows the old adage about improvised music somehow not being best appreciated via the recordings to beautiful pieces. This is a music that demands re-visiting, that seems to alter, slightly, every time it is played, with new details emerging, new relationships of tone and style, new romance, even. Recorded during a mammoth stint in Krakow, Poland where Brötzmann and Leigh played as part of big bands, trios, quartets and duos, this duo performance represents the diamond heart of the sessions, an improvised set that bears little relation to what either of the players have achieved outside of its prodigious gravity.\nWe mentioned romance and really 'Ears Are Filled With Wonder’, a play on a line from the poet Kenneth Patchen, showcases the full reach of Brötzmann’s rebel lyricism, his lover man style, now smoky, seductive, late night, now roaring and vibrating with energy. Leigh plays it extremely subtly, sometimes fixing on the most suggestive detail and from there spinning luscious webs of repeat-time bliss that make for some of the most psychedelic and otherworldly settings of strings and horn. Elsewhere the two of them tear the roof off with tactile fuzz and horn ascensions.\nIt’s a music of organic depth, of endlessly evocative unfolding, as themes bloom and sigh and disappear and arise and it feels curiously out of time, even as both players push their instruments into futuristic configurations. As such it doesn’t sit neatly in either players’ extensive catalogues. Rather, this is a music of perpetual change, of summing up and of pushing on, a music that feels genuinely new even as it runs an umbilical deep into the tradition of getting out. Indeed, even Brötzmann’s signature artwork and sleeve design seems to have mutated in turn, forsaking the blacks and whites and reds of old, the stark iconography of previous releases, for something more subtly evocative and colourful.\n'Ears Are Filled With Wonder’ is a coming together of two of the most original voices on their respective instruments and the title reflects the joyful uncovering of a whole new way of listening and relating. Indeed, it might well be the first ever freely improvised electric pedal steel and saxophone duet ever put to tape. Either way it is one of the most startlingly beautiful combinations of players and temperaments to orbit the European jazz scene in years. And this is only the beginning. So hold tight.\nMoshe Idel\nRonda, Spain\nFebruary 2016",

The relationships between the players are tonally odd: woozy, mournful, almost baroque blues or even more chamber music in feel, the quality of the interplay is subtle and natural, like modern ballads.\nIn the recordings Peter is pushed more to the front and it’s astounding to hear him playing with such strength after almost two years of inactivity; this is one of the first concerts he played while the world was still in the midst of the pandemic. You can feel the weight of the moment in these recordings and can imagine a captive audience under the spell of this strange music that never feels overstated, hurried, frantic or finding.",

            "about": "Explosive new full-length live album from BRÖTZMANN/LEIGH, the duo of Peter Brötzmann (tenor, alto-saxophones, tarogato, b-flat clarinet) and Heather Leigh (pedal steel guitar) recorded at the legendary WELS festival in November 2016 and released in May 2017, exactly two years after the duo began their on-going collaboration in Glasgow, Scotland at the Tectonics festival.\nSEX TAPE fully delivers on the fantasy of this dream-team hook-up, focusing less on the sensuous new sound strategies and spectral instant compositions of their debut album, Ears Are Filled With Wonder, and instead making for the jugular with a massively energetic slab of continually evolving high-energy exchange that sees both players pushing the potential of their instruments all the way into-the-red.\nThis is the evolved dynamic of two musicians fully-engaged and beyond thought, sometimes playing as a single instrument, taking a heady feel for bruising microtonality and going toe-to-toe with the kind of stark/eviscerated psychedelic noise strategies that stagger and swoon all the way into the realms of ritual music and hallucinated third ear soundings. Leigh wields her F/X pedals like weapons, sharpening her attack, making woozy her melodic lines, using a volume pedal to generate projective force while shaving the swells with tone clusters like broken razors.\nBrötzmann makes with some of his most original gambits, pushing hard into vectors and tangents that refuse the gravity of his back catalogue. Some of the more lunar sections see the duo touching on ambient Krautrock, even.\nBrötzmann has underlined in interviews that the music he plays with Leigh should not be identified as free jazz and here it really feels like he is formulating a new music moment-to-moment, taking off from seminal one-offs in his catalogue like the duo set with Bill Laswell, Low Life, combing machine noise with incredible ticker-tape multiphonics, an odd old-time jazz religiosity and a bruising blues and rock/roll-informed approach to rocking the god damned bandstand.\nExpertly mastered by Martin Siewart (who rumour has it will be working on the duo’s upcoming/highly-anticipated studio album), the mix works to bring out the most tactile qualities of the sound: you feel the pulse and the rhythms of every exchange, the body-rocking bass, the ghosts of the upper register. With track markers throughout it’s possible to drop into moments: Brötzmann setting fire to Leigh’s gossamer melodies, Leigh exploding feedback fireworks over voids of saxophone drone. Dynamic, psychedelic, always new: BRÖTZMANN/LEIGH play BRÖTZMANN/LEIGH music.\nAnd what’s with the sleeve and title? SEX TAPE: a leaked document of extreme duo interaction, the sensuous private made public, the crude sexuality of Brötzmann’s early sides – Balls, Nipples – re-played as a devious creation myth. But Jesus what a sound!\nMoshe Idel\nJerusalem",

            "about": "There is complexity in simplicity, and Sparrow Nights is Peter Brötzmann and Heather Leigh's most enduring record to date, and their first studio album. A series of emotionally rich and boldly elucidated tonal and timbral exchanges played like compositions on pedal steel and reeds, the tracks (released as a 6 track LP and 10 track CD) are cold-forged minimalist blues motifs dragged from instrumental laments.\nAfter three years playing together Brötzmann/Leigh's connection and understanding is by now both cerebral and deeply invested in the physical and sensory possibilities of their combined sound, while retaining a melancholic distance. Within this duo there is fluidity – neither is the anchor – and these recordings sound with as much variety as the sea. At times Sparrow Nights carries the clarity and poeticism of still water and open horizon (\"This Word Love\"), and at others it contains the elemental and ferocious roar of white water breakers on black rocks (\"This Time Around\").\nOn their previous three live albums (Ears Are Filled With Wonder, Sex Tape, Crowmoon) the duo have developed an intimate and intense language that manifests here as a focus on power and control, where figures blasted of unnecessary decoration are drawn from the shadows and smoke of collapse. The studio setting also allows Brötzmann to bring a broader range of reeds than in live scenarios: where previously he has played primarily tenor, clarinet and tarogato with Leigh, here he delivers the heat of alto and the low pressure of bass saxophone and clarinet.\nBrötzmann’s duo with Leigh continues to trace a fresh new arc in his trajectory, and this release also falls at a time when Leigh releases Throne, her most song-based record to date. Here as a studio duo they play a new-old blues for times of complexity, noise and chaos, continuing to redefine and re-sound possibilities for improvised music.\nJLA",

As we embark on a new century amidst socio-political upheaval, the Brötzmann/Haino duo feels like an artistic expression of the moment we are living in and experiencing every day.”\n- Philip Greenlief “Ode to Destruction\", ART FORUM, August 2018 on Peter Brötzmann / Keiji Haino Duo at the Chapel, San Francisco\nThe first music on record by the iconic free music duo of Peter Brötzmann & Keiji Haino since 1996. Two complete performances recorded in Los Angeles and San Francisco in the summer of 2018. The intellect given birth to here (existence) is too young presents the artists traversing a sprawling range of sound and modalities; achieving a stunning unreplicable alchemy and perhaps the defining work of their decades-long collaboration. Presented in a deluxe 4LP boxed set edition of 800 including full size, full color art prints by both artists.",

            "about": "Long Story Short, the festival organized as the 25th edition of Unlimited in Wels, Austria (3.-6.November 2011) ventured to design a festival around Peter Brötzmann’s practice. Not a retrospective but a representation of the contemporary musical spheres that Brötzmann and his comrades are investigating today.\nThis box documents in 18 performances Brötzmann‘s close ties to the Chicago scene, his inclination to work with Japanese artists, his cultivation of old and new friendships from New York, his enthusiasm for African musicians and collaborations with his European friends.\n5cds\ndisc 1: tracks 1-4\ndisc 2: tracks 5-8\ndisc 3: tracks 9-10\ndisc 4: tracks 11-14\ndisc 5: tracks 15-18",

            "about": "It is a huge honour to announce the publication of Peter Brotzmann’s final concerts on OTOROKU. When we invited Peter to do a residency at Cafe OTO back in February 2023 we had no idea these would be his last ever shows and he played with such power it would have been hard for anyone present to believe he would never play publicly again.\nRecorded over two nights this grouping of Jason Adasiewicz on vibraphone, John Edwards on bass and Steve Noble on drums feels especially resonant and personal to Cafe OTO. The first time Peter performed at the venue back in 2010 it was in a trio with John and Steve, (released as The Worse The Better kick starting our in-house record label) so it feels fitting that the last shows he ever played here should also have that trio at its core.\nThe quartet last played together at OTO back in 2013, (released as Mental Shake on OTOROKU), and Brotzmann humbly opened the return of the group saying, \"it's a pleasure to be back” before launching straight into a long blast on the alto sax, swiftly met by the relentless energy and engagement of Adasiewicz, Edwards and Noble.\nThere are moments of tenderness to Brotzmann’s playing that feels specific to this small group - one that cuts across three generations - and in a space that’s come to feel like home. Of course, there is dizzying, forceful, singleminded playing, but even amongst a relentless chorus of cymbal splashes and busy vibraphone clusters the lyrical, spacious moments are savoured and held onto. As he remarked at the end of the group's first visit to OTO, “the Quartet is, for us, a great adventure.”\nPeter clearly wanted to play to the end. Did he know these might be his last shows? We will never know. What is clear is he wanted to go out in style and on his terms. For anyone in the room at the time or listening to these recordings it’s clear he achieved that.\nIt was Peter’s wish that these recordings should be made public and he was due to finalise the cover design on the week he passed away. We would like to thank Peter’s family for working with us to fulfil Peter’s wishes to release this material but more than anything we would like to thank Peter himself for all the extraordinary memories, his generosity and all he has given the music. On a personal level for us, like so many, he meant a huge amount and we miss him deeply.\nThe Quartet will be released as a complete recording on 2CD and as a special edit version on 2LP. Both feature artwork by Peter Brotzmann and UNTIET and are complete with photographs by Dawid Laskowski.\nOTOROKU will also release a special 4LP boxset edition, limited to 250 copies and only available direct from us. Pre-orders are on the website now and Cafe OTO members will receive a 20% discount.\n--",
