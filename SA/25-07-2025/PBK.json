            "about": "Released as a CD on Electroshock Records (Russia), 2002.\nReviews:\n\"A Moment of Infinity is the second collaboration between Artemiy Artemiev and Phillip B. Klingler (aka PBK). 'Dreams in Moving Space' (released in 2000) created an eerie, haunted atmosphere. This one is more tempered, although 'A Rite of Passage' has its disquieting moments. Most of the elements from the first album were used again, but with more subtlety. Ghostly samples play a lesser role. Whenever rhythms appear, they consist of tribal percussion instead of electronic beats. Here, one must point out the quality of the programming. Everything on the album is played via keyboards -- no 'real' percussion whatsoever, but they truly feel natural. 'Broken Sleep in the Fracture Zone' quickly sets the tone: long keyboard chords, spacy synth swirls, some odd samples, and unidentified sounds. All this is sculpted with great artistry, more detailed but with less immediate impact than on the previous CD. The first track ends with an episode of tribal percussion and grunts, very suggestive. The main piece should be the 27-minute title track, but it gets lost in its own meanders, lingering on for too long. It is quickly eclipsed by 'A Rite of Passage', where the voice of Artemiev's young son, sampled women voices, and heavier experimental electronics (filter manipulations the likes of Fennesz and Hazard) give the piece a different personality and bring the album to an excellent stop. A Moment of Infinity requires a bit more effort from the listener, but it rewards accordingly.\" (AllMusic Guide)\n\"A Moment of Infinity opens with 'Broken Sleep in the Fracture Zone', an eleven minute collage of ambient drones, industrial creaks and groans, distant 'tribal' like percussion, and an overwhelming feeling of being a speck in the cosmos. I also get a disturbing mind-picture of a blasted landscape full of the distant howls of whalesong or mutated foghorns... Next track is 'The Other Side of the Inner World' - this opens with some slow and very deep marimba-type vibes mixed with gentle, almost industrial style drones, a gamelan drifts in and out, the whole soundscape just drifts in space past that orbiting Dunkin' DoNuts franchise with its flickering fluorescent sign. 'Endless Voyage' is next, and as the title suggests it is extremely cosmic - again a drifting, shifting variety of drones and samples weave and entwine across the speakers, a clock strikes the hour and then morphs into a mutated twang, this track doesn't really go anywhere, but that, of course, is the whole point. The overall effect is of hanging around one of the LaGrange Points in a spacesuit and literally chillin' out... Track 4, 'In a Moment of Infinity' is the album's magnum opus in terms of length - twenty seven minutes and small change - and once again a clock is striking the hour over some low key drones and pulses, riven here and there with sampled choral voices and radio-astronomy radio chatter. One keeps expecting to see the monolith from '2001: A Space Odyssey' floating across the speakers. Despite its length, there's a richness in sound and feel here, and an awe-inspiring timelessness - space is kinda huge, ya know, but that space between your ears is even bigger! The final track is 'A Rite of Passage', darker sounds now, perhaps the ghouls of a graveyard are coming out to play, the sounds are certainly more demonic. A tribal, almost voodoo, beat emerges from the crowing voices and it chugs along as the drums beat on, joined by the flapping of batwings. Voices chant in the distance, debatable whether they are angelic or that of the Hellish Host - then again, this could be where all the rappers go when they die... 'A Moment of Infinity' is an impressive album - for much of its duration it is a space trip, the nearest thing to hitching a lift on that UFO doing the grand tour of the Solar System and all points up. Only the final track tends to darken that vision into something akin to falling into a black hole. This collaboration between Artemiy Artemiev and Phillip B. Klinger seems to have brought out the visionary in both of them and it is a vision well worth seeking out.\" (The Borderland)\n\"The prolific Russian musician, composer and producer Artemiy Artemiev continues his collaborations with other musicians from all over the world. 'A Moment of Infinity' showcases five long experimental and artsy suites with e-orchestral backgrounds and noises worked out with Phillip B. Klingler, whom we are used to refer to as P.B.K.. This is Artemiev's second collaboration with him (the first one being 'Dreams in Moving Space', 2000) but the overall sound differs from the first one as it is more atmospheric and less \"noir\". There are practically no electronic beats and actually no definite rhythmical structures are to be found (except for a short percussive pattern in the last and darker composition), yet there are a number of weird tribal sampled percussions that give it a truly native and distant appeal. The Russian coldness of deserted landscapes covered in snow is only one of the virtual places you will visit when travelling this musical journey... On the other hand percussive (mainly metallic percussion) sounds sometimes almost recall African shores, like a warmer wind blowing through the snow and melting the snow... Clearly, it is a very visionary album. Industrial drones interwove with ritual field sounds, atmospheres of stillness and infinity are the playground for spacey and drifting experimentalisms that remind me of a bunch of releases from 'Extreme Records' I once reviewed, which included Skuli Sverrison's all-bass 'Seremonie' album and a Shinjuku Thief work. Almost 70 minutes of glacial and noble avant-garde sounds for the true lovers of envelope-pushing.\" (Chain D.L.K.)\n\"A Moment Of Infinity (ELCD 022) is another collaboration. This time Artemiy is with Phillip B. Klingler. Again, it's a five track album, ranging from the fairly short (!) five minutes twenty, to the title track, an almost album-length stunner, at 27 minutes. 'Broken Sleep in the Fracture Zone' kicks off the album and we're straight into industrial ambience. I love albums like this with titles rather than part numbers as it imparts what the writers have in mind (well, I like to think that!). 'Fracture Zone' is a dark, menacing place where a steady ambient wash is punctuated by effects and strange, alien sounds. Cracking opener although I'm not too sure about the later addition of the drums. 'The Other Side of the Inner World' reminds the listener of some fogbound landscape, with frost forming on the branches of the willow near the lake... Again, a superbly atmospheric piece with ambient washes and sfx ranging from reversed sounds, bells, and additional washes of dark ambience. 'Endless Voyage' is actually quite a light and uplifting piece, almost as if the sun was breaking through the clouds, having spent the night next to the above lake! Ambience proliferates in waves whilst low and deep sfx underpin it all - a really superb piece. The title track is next, all twenty seven minutes. How do you begin with such little space? Well, as you should know by now, pieces as long as this morph and evolve like a life form. Well, surprisingly it doesn't change too dramatically in all that time. It starts with what I could well imagine a graveyard scene where a bells is tolling with spirit choirs fading in and out with a variety of truly unsettling effects. These gradually build and build, and like I say, slightly alter, which doesn't actually change to piece too much. 'Rite of Passage' is as spooky as hell. In and amongst the effects, Artemiy Jnr. makes his vocal debut and those noises the baby makes are echoed and treated to produce an intensely unsettling effect! The piece builds up with soft metallic sheets interspersed with samples of vocals and sfx, morphed to a point where they sound alien to the ears. Unsettling, yet inventive as hell. The beat that arrives after around four minutes gives a good anchor to one's sanity - it sounds almost like a skiffle!\" (Modern Dance)\n\"Artemiy Artemiev has solid credentials in the field of avant-garde electroacoustic music, from his earlier electronic endeavors like 'Cold' and 'Point of Intersection', to his Electroshock label Electroacoustic Music series, each presenting an array of experimental compositions by various composers. These four recent releases present collaborations with some of his notable contemporaries; in the case of PBK and Frohmader, Artemiev has collaborated with them on earlier recordings, while these are his first with Seattle based De Laurentis and the British ensemble Karda Estra. \"A Moment of Infinity\" operates in pretty much similar territory as '57 Minutes to Silence', but tends to be more integrated with fragmentary melodic content - however abstract, via the use of electronics and percussives, and an overall higher density. This gives it a somewhat less industrial character, although it's still very avant-garde and free form. And did I mention dark? Again, the primary source of content seems to be that of sampled and processed slabs of sound, often juxtaposed with the synths and percussives in such a way to produce a fairly disturbing soundscape. 'The Other Side of the Inner World' is perhaps the most sinister of the five tracks herein, with low-frequency droning sharing space with seemingly random percussion and found sounds. The title track stretches out for nearly half an hour of drifting, arhythmic industrial hell-sounds over haunting drones, with random outbursts of recognizable instrumentation. Some interesting stuff here, not unlike the soundtrack for a horror movie. In summary, these showcase a new waterfront in electroacoustic music, reaching well beyond traditional electronic and ambient realms and infusing both with some very avant-garde and experimental ideas. While any of these might be recommended for those already into 'challenging' music, 'Transfiguration\" and 'Equilibrium' probably offer a better embarking point for listeners steeped in traditional structures.\" (Expose)\n\"Tres opportunement intitule 'A Moment of Infinity', ce disque e`st la seconde collaboration d'Artemiy Artemiev avec Phillip B. Klinger, alias PBK, obscure figure americaine de la musique industrielle des annees 80. Du haut de son vaisseau \"ambient astral\", le capitaine Artemiev s'adresse ici a tous les amateurs de voyages immobiles. Il les invite a un sejour en apesanteur dans des regions sonores mysterieuses, aux confins de l'ambient ethnique, de l'indus climatique et de la musique de film d'horreur. Soit une expedition tenebreuse d'une duree totale de 68 minutes decoupee en 5 longs episodes. Plus nuance que son predecesseur, cet album delaisse les rythmiques electroniques pour se tourner davantage vers des percussions d'inspiration tribale . Au sommet de leur inspiration, le Russe et l'Americain peignent une fresque sonore menacante ou sons cosmiques et bruits animaliers s'agglomerent subtilement. Ce qui, a l'arrivee, induit une oeuvre environnementale pas franchement eloignee de l'ecole isolationniste, dans la droite lignee des travaux de labels comme 'Heart of Space' et 'Projekt'.\" (Solenoide)\n\"Artemiy and Phillip B. Klingler's previous effort - 'Dreams In Moving Space' - was one of Artemiy's more abstract ventures dealing with sound explorations that slowly developed basic themes. This new release - 'A Moment of Infinity' - continues the duo's focus on sound but is a more varied and atmospheric work. It's loaded with dark spacey backdrops and percussion and a recurring theme of ghostly and sometimes anguished voices provide the bulk of the intensity. Much of the music sounds like an avant-garde soundtrack to an expedition over a cold dark and deathly quiet landscape. The mood is eerie and unfolds gradually with the focus on painting on an aural canvas. Among the highlights is 'A Rite of Passage' which is one of the wildest tracks of the set. It's something of a freakout collage of Halloween screams and yowls, electroacoustic conglomerations, avant-Chamber music, drum n bass patterns, and intense atmospherics that flows and blends beautifully. But the real gem is the epic \"In a Moment of Infinity\" which includes even more intense moans and howls on one of the albums more abstract works. I really enjoyed the prominent and varied percussion which infuses an element of sometimes startling chaos into this non-stop parade of dark atmospherics, drones, gongs, bells, and countless undefinable sounds. A fantastic voyage of sound that will keep you spellbound throughout it's entire 27 minute length. Don't listen to this in the dark on Halloween if you have a weak heart. Another recommended set.\" (Aural Innovations)\n\"Exploring the darkest frontiers of Ambient, these two composers show us one of the most radical aspects in their respective styles. Five electronic pieces, featuring an infinity of disquieting sounds coming and going, constitute sinister paintings, capable of making us imagine descents into caverns brimming with unearthly beings, or astral voyages beyond the limits of space or time.\" (Amazing Sounds)\n\"Artemiev and Klinger's first collab, 2000's 'Dreams in Moving Space', was a terrorizing tour-de-force and a tough act to follow. 'A Moment of Infinity' does not approach that level of intensity, but it's deeply unsettling in its own right. Ghostly moans and drones predominate, punctuated with eerie bells, metallic scrapes and other strange sounds, conjuring hordes of lost souls rising like smoke from a million graves. For reasons I can't explain, I'm also reminded of the Apathetics, memorable characters from John Boorman's bizarre 1974 sci-fi flick 'Zardoz'. If you've seen it, you'll get it, if not, just ignore my rambling; it's really beyond my powers to describe this stuff in any coherent manner. Suffice to say if weird, deep-space ambience is your bag, you'll want to hear this.\" (Demo Universe)",

            "about": "From tape liner notes:\n(Abstractions in sound and rhythm)\nRecorded/mixed Fall 1989.\nInstrumentation:\nA/ Analog synthesis (tracks 1-4)\nB/ Digital Synthesis (tracks 5--8)\nDedicated to Martin Rev.\nReviews:\n\"The Coltrane influence in the title is obvious, the influence on the music is more subtle.The release is composed of analog synthesis and digital synthesis sides. The analog side begins with soft, subdued tones and progresses to a pleasant noise crescendo punctuated by a staccato distortion loop. The digital side evokes more of the spirit of Coltrane with its evocative noise melodies integrated with a slight digital keyboard feel. A fitting tribute that is highly recommended.\" (Factsheet Five)\n\"As PBK puts it, 'A Noise Supreme', is a collection of 'abstractions in sound and rhythm'. One side of this tape uses analog synthesizers, the other digital - and the two sides do sound worlds apart. The analog side is quite a forbidding place, where a howling wind kicks up a blinding sandstorm that obliterates the landscape. When the dust finally settles, the terrain proves barren, with nothing but jagged rocks as far as the eye can see. You're just about to give up and go home, when a deafening whine fills the air. As you rush to cover your ears, the ground starts rumbling, and fissures begin to gape open all around you. Somehow, despite what seems an impending death never comes, and you emerge unscathed. The digital side is, in fact, the noise supreme - more richly textures, with a great depth and feel. Sometimes jackhammers threaten to vibrate your fillings right out of your head, and at others, synths lift you up off your feet, giving you a birds-eye view of the entire planet. On side B (which contains many shorter pieces, as opposed to the three or four long pieces of side A) there is always a sense of change, of motion, and of space that makes it much more fulfilling. At least in PBK's universe, the digital planet is definitely the place to be.\" (File 13)",

            "about": "Chain Letter Exhortation Series, #3\nThe Chain Letter Exhortation Series explores the idea of creating an audio composition and passing it from one participant to another while adding to, modifying and remixing the structure. Unlike the \"Exquisite Corpse\", where each artist places their contribution where the last artist's works ends, in the \"chain\" each artist listens to and decides how to integrate with or subvert the entire structure at their whim. There are no set rules. The process is dictated by each participant, there could be close collaboration between participants, discussions of direction and methodology, or there might be none of that. The personality stamp of the individual may be strong, or might be closer to anonymity.\nThe \"chain letter\" concept began in the late 50's via the mail-art movement. One of its most ardent devotees was Detroit-born, Ray Johnson.\n\"The enigmatic Neo-Dada collagist... Johnson’s stock-in-trade was benevolent chain letters asking recipients if they would kindly add something to what was already enclosed and pass the updated artwork (often an irreverent collage) along to someone new. He didn’t care about getting the letters back so much as giving them long and eventful lives, with many idiosyncratic transformations along the way.\" (Smithsonian, 2018)\n\"By concentrating on mail art, with its invitation to alter the work by whomever receives it, he refused to create a body of work that exhibited a narrative arc of his own 'development.' That productive repudiation carries forward the only motive of the avant-garde that really matters anymore: undoing Western culture’s ever-widening separation of one’s life (living) from one’s art (making).\" (Hyperallergic, 2015)\nLater, the idea was taken up by audio artists working in the cassette underground who would exchange tapes from artist to artist to mix and remix. \"International Mail-Music Group\" with Al Margolis, Bogart, Rafael Flores and Yutaka Tanaka (1986), and \"Chain Mail Collab\" with Das Ubuibi, Jeph Jerman, John Hudak and PBK (1988) both exemplify the four-way collaboration approach used for the Chain Letter Exhortation Series. For purposes of study, the separate mixes are included with the digital download.",

            "about": "Cassette release 1988.\n\"This was, and still is, a brilliant release. I wish 10% of contemporary noise releases sounded this good.\" Heathen Harvest\n\"Pure sonic art terrorism. Beyond harsh. Beyond abrasive. Beyond 'industrial madness' or 'power electronics' or 'difficult listening' or any of the usual labels that are thrown around like brand names. You'll find here no didactic dogmatic drivel; no tapes of Manson or references to Aleister Crowley or Magick or mass murder or rape or any of that pretend stuff. This is no-excuses, abstract monolithic POWER. Raw and unbridled, yet with a keen compositional sense rivaled by few. This cassette possesses a sound so potent and disruptive that it is nearly tangible- very real, very threatening. An electronic incendiary device. I really can't say much more about ASESINO! You'll just have to hear it! Makes almost everybody else doing similar work come off like Perry Como. No cliches. Just guts and intelligence. A mature, complex work that must be reckoned with.\" Electronic Cottage #1, 1989\n\"It's not difficult to guess what this is like after hearing a few other PBK cassettes: more whirl and blur. The man will not let up, not until the listener gives in or shuts up. At points the rhythm takes a fevered pitch, though funk this is not. Even when the music shifts into a lull, and never for long, the listener is not lulled (fooled). So, make no mistake, this is aggressive electronic music which is good brain food for a certain state of mind. It will probably send the rest of the world running in fits of panic to escape from the noise, and everyone is entitled to their own opinion. This is the sound of stress. This is the state of unrest. This is the sound that comes long after the silence. I like it.\" (Lowlife)",

            "about": "\"Asmus Sources\" — a behind-the-curtain glimpse into my collaborations with the legendary Asmus Tietchens, featuring source material I created and sent to him in 1989 and 1996. Most artists keep this kind of raw material to themselves, but I’ve long believed the process deserves its own spotlight. You’ll hear the minimalist microsound and drone pieces that formed the foundation for our CD \"Five Manifestoes\", as well as the more chaotic, filter-driven turntable work that never quite clicked for Asmus — and which he ultimately shelved. This release is rare in its honesty: not just about collaboration when it works, but when it doesn’t.\nOriginally released in a digital edition, 2011 (The Sound Genetic, USA).",

            "about": "Released as a CD on Xerxes Records (Japan) 2007.\n\"Govt. Alpha and PBK utilize every weapon available in their respective considerable arsenals, distorting, twisting, abusing, transmuting, fragmenting, rending, torturing, compressing, flaying, and finally leaving the ragged remains for dead, lying in a pool of blood, piss and excrement; pulling out the sound of those squealing, screeching microseconds before impact and stretching it past anything it was ever meant to endure. This is a battery of intense magnitude and constancy, never letting up, never allowing for however brief a time any form of respite or relief, it just keeps coming on relentlessly and determinedly. Finally we have the closing track, ‘Fuscous Sun’, almost a mirror image of the opener, time and the temporal membranes de-shattering to mend themselves and restore the rule of reality, albeit a fractured one, full of hurt, pain and devastation, a reality unlooked-for. As I have often said, the best music, of whatever colour, has the capacity to inspire, to conjure images and to spark off mental chain-reactions. As fanciful (or as some would say irrelevant) as the foregoing might appear, nevertheless this is what ripped through my mind as I was listening to it. Whatever the original intentions of the creators may have been, I can unequivocally attest to the power and might of this fine collaborative effort, bringing with it the hope that these two might venture to grace us with more of their nuclear vision sometime in the future.\" (Heathen Harvest)",

            "about": "Chain Letter Exhortation Series, #4\nThe Chain Letter Exhortation Series explores the idea of creating an audio composition and passing it from one participant to another while adding to, modifying and remixing the structure. Unlike the \"Exquisite Corpse\", where each artist places their contribution where the last artist's works ends, in the \"chain\" each artist listens to and decides how to integrate with or subvert the entire structure at their whim. There are no set rules. The process is dictated by each participant, there could be close collaboration between participants, discussions of direction and methodology, or there might be none of that. The personality stamp of the individual may be strong or might be closer to anonymity.\nThe \"chain letter\" concept began in the late 50's via the mail-art movement. One of its most ardent devotees was Detroit-born, Ray Johnson.\n\"The enigmatic Neo-Dada collagist... Johnson’s stock-in-trade was benevolent chain letters asking recipients if they would kindly add something to what was already enclosed and pass the updated artwork (often an irreverent collage) along to someone new. He didn’t care about getting the letters back so much as giving them long and eventful lives, with many idiosyncratic transformations along the way.\" (Smithsonian, 2018)\n\"By concentrating on mail art, with its invitation to alter the work by whomever receives it, he refused to create a body of work that exhibited a narrative arc of his own 'development.' That productive repudiation carries forward the only motive of the avant-garde that really matters anymore: undoing Western culture’s ever-widening separation of one’s life (living) from one’s art (making).\" (Hyperallergic, 2015)\nLater, the idea was taken up by audio artists working in the cassette underground who would exchange tapes from artist to artist to mix and remix. \"International Mail-Music Group\" with Al Margolis, Bogart, Rafael Flores and Yutaka Tanaka (1986), and \"Chain Mail Collab\" with Das Ubuibi, Jeph Jerman, John Hudak and PBK (1988) both exemplify the four-way collaboration approach used for the Chain Letter Exhortation Series. For purposes of study, the separate mixes are included with the digital download.",

            "about": "Chain mail collaborations on cassette were an important way of networking in the 80's/90's between like-minded artists, tapes sent back and forth via post from one sound artist to another. Upon receipt of the master tape the recipient would transform it by adding their own layer then sending it on to the next person in the \"chain\". The finished version of this particular collab never materialized and even though this layer of the process was documented, the final version was likely quite different.",

Features two compositions: \"Cornwall Spectre\", a noise-ambient track that was originally created for Neil McIntee's art exhibit in the UK in 2010 and commemorates the haunted Cornwall Building in Flint. The second track, \"Holloway Reservoir Creeps\" is built on shortwave radio noise merged with media voice clips towards a sickening conclusion. The Holloway Dam, constructed in 1955, created a lake that covers 25 acres of land near the city of Flint. Many drownings and incidents of foul play have occurred there in the decades since.",

            "about": "Released as a cassette on PBK Recordings in 1988.\n\"Richly layered, thick textures. Hissing, thumping loops of purely abstract noise and an almost musical, distorted phrase. Every sound working independently of the other, and yet meshing together into one... this is seemingly the one unchanging theme of PBK's work. Swooping distortion, gritty and alarming, yet somehow calming as well. An after the storm calm settles in for the last track on side one, with a modal four-note phrase, backed by a drone. Smeared hints of angry and scared voices screeching and multiplied with delays. More obscured voices burbling with what sounds like a violin playing lightly intimates a nightmare party, ghostly debutantes and gentlemen and ladies echoing from a distant past. Walking through a hall nearby an aviary with a public address system speaking in tongues in the far distance. Resolute bong of an ancient alien bell, and clockwork. This 1988 (release) from PBK is important in understanding his early work...\" (AUTOreverse)\n\"A friend of Vidna Obmana produced one of the best 'industrial' releases I heard in times. It is not really harsh music, spacey seems an appropriate term for describing it, as PBK uses lots of echo or delay (analogue or digital), plus lots of sampling. The first track on side A is very energetic, great rhythm with an even greater (broken) saxophone loop. Another good track can be found on side B, softly processed feedback, tons of echo, another successor to Werkbund (Asmus Tietchens). So, all in all, a good tape.\" (Vital)\n\"Slow-moving, rich synthesizer music that's nearly overwhelming through headphones. The interplay of sounds drags the listener along to dark and deep realms of thought, in a way that reminded me of Lovecraft's description of the descent to dreamland. Eerie and exciting.\" (Factsheet Five)\n\"Steady-state, noise-as-wallpaper; Imagine early Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze through a distortion box. Recommended walkman/blaster material for late-night subways & deserted cityscapes.\" (Ear Magazine)\n\"Die Brucke rides the pulse with Martin Rev. The music finds its way to places most people would not ask to go. Louder playback makes for more cheerless fun. Everything but the sound sits still, and the sound moves closer and closer. PBK is one of the most talented members of the current American tape underground. Don't miss this noise.\" (Lowlife)",

            "about": "Released as a CD on Electroshock Records (Russia), 2000.\nReviews:\n\"The Electroshock catalogue grows stronger with each subsequent release and now represent cutting edge Electronica in their idiosyncratic, yet very singular fashion. Artemiev / Phillip B. Klingler's 'Dreams in Moving Space' is a nightmarish descent into Hell. The title, which may be mistaken for a floating almost New Age-y CD, could not be further from the reality. 'Nightmares in Moving Space' would be a more appropriate title perhaps. This CD is a disturbed, dreadful sonic passage through dreams gone askew, that of shadow-filled sound worlds. Artemiev and Klingler possess a sound dissimilar to any other artist in this field and manage to produce music that really has no particular sonic traits with which a listener may relate. This makes for a perfect premise for these ears, as loathsome as it is listening to a new CD only to feel as though given this month's version of last month's big seller. There is a distinct iciness to the sound - pictures of an unending frozen tundra one might relate to Koner's works. This is not Koner, though. Whereas Koner manages to recreate the wide-open spaces, this recording can be quite claustrophobic at times. There are essentials of 'Stalker' as well, with its dark, menacing drones, unrecognizable animal sounds, and the suspense of what awaits around the next turn. Rapoon's \"Just Say faith\" is another point of reference. No matter the comparisons as they are provided only to lend the reader a slight suggestion of the moods portrayed. This CD is in a territory of it's own. Set against blowing forlorn wind effects, the pealing of distant bells and a lone cello the CD begins on an ominous note, continuing on an ever-downward spiral. Music doesn't usually creep me out, yet (on first listen) I must admit to turning this one off twenty minutes in - so disturbing the sound. Thunder claps, moaning half-human cries and other sonic effects made this listener feel as though this must be what Hell sounds like. Animals gnawing at objects unseen, ripping reverberations, crackling static, hissing snakes and the ever-present crunching of footsteps - always just seconds away - lend a feeling of anxiety and trepidation to this recording. Finally, there is that 'double-edged ' approach whereas a quiet listen will provide one with a rewarding ambient experience - yet for those loud sessions there is much to unearth from the mix. Layer upon layer of fantastic sounds overlap each other, one more disconcerting then the last. This CD is perfect for Halloween or clearing your home of those pesky guests. If 'Stalker' and 'Heresy' are to your liking you will most certainly treasure this release as well. Sweet Dreams aren't made of this...\" (The Raging Consciousness Desk)\n\"From ace Russian electronic soundsculpter and ambient artist Artemiy Artemiev (working with Phillip B. Klinger) comes what is easily one of the scariest recordings of dark ambient music I've ever heard. 'Dreams in Moving Space' will definitely be played on my outdoor speakers on Halloween for all the neighborhood kiddies to hear. Attempting to accurately describe this music would be impossible (yes, even for me). It's filled with everything from minor key swirling synthesizers, deep drones, odd synthesizer effects, post-industrial noise, dissonance, and about a million other creepy sounds. Okay, okay - you convinced me. I'll try to adequately describe this CD. Sheesh! Another thing about 'Dreams in Moving Space' is that it's long. It clocks in at over seventy-four minutes in length. You're really getting more than you bargained for here, in more ways than one. If I could afford to lose the bet, I'd wager that you can't last through the whole album in a pitch black room. 'Dreams in Moving Space. Part I' opens the CD with an eerie series of synths rising and falling over a background of spooky high-pitched keyboards, odd and reverbed rustlings and rumblings, and whistling synth textures. Kinda like being on a ghost ship in the middle of the night and it's raining outside and...well, you get the idea. It's seriously macabre music! I mean it! It's also over twenty-minutes long and lots more happens before it's over. 'Lost Souls in Bamboo Jungle' is less oppressive but is certainly just as weird. Echoed gong-like tones, sounding like glass tubes being struck, blend with heavily-echoed distorted spoken words. Industrial elements in the background and truly bizarre keyboard textures swirl and dance all around. The song inspires a strange sort of vertigo due to the way the vocals seem to come and go. At times, there is what sounds like the gurgling growl of something.. well, to use a line from the SF movie John Carpenter's 'The Thing', \"Whatever it is, it's big and it's pissed off\". You get a mild breather with a short five-minute song at the mid-point, 'Between People, or Within' which is an odd arrhythmic atonal soundscape with disturbing scraping noises and howling-like noises. Ya gotta hear it to understand what I'm trying to say, trust me. The album closes with the seventeen-minute 'Murmurs Across the Surface' and Part II of 'Dreams in Moving Space (Moscow Mix)' (sixteen minutes). 'Murmurs Across the Surface' is very dark ambient at its finest - terrifying, unearthly, and yet compelling at times. Synth chords that almost seem to rise and fall in tone are mixed with what sounds like the labored breathing of a giant mechanism. Crank this puppy up (it gets kinda loud at times) and watch your neighbors beat hell outta their houses. They'll probably call a priest thinking your house needs an exorcism. The relentless intensity of the song (with its occasional monstrous crashing gong reverberating like a sonic boom) will suck the joy out of you. Some really disturbing 'crunching' noises appear and I'm really glad I'm writing this review during daylight hours. Believe it or not, the CD finally does lose some of its terror on the last cut (relatively speaking). The music is still dark, but a sense of sorrowful beauty has emerged, even amidst the lower register synths, reverbed and echoed gong effects, and almost moaning sounds. What really threw me, though, was the emergence of a rapid-fire drum rhythm in the back of the mix. Counterpointing the noir elements with this \"snare drum and high-hat on speed\" beat is more than a little disconcerting. It's really weird to hear it so far down in the mix. The drones and synths clearly still dominate the song. Eventually, the cut starts to seriously wig out. Abrasive sounding noises (like a person making rasping noises through a respirator) mix with the synths and that crazy unchanging rhythm. It could drive you bonkers. This doesn't last and the mournful drones again take center stage. Arteimy Artemiev and Phillip B. Klinger have fashioned a nightmarish and surrealistic vision of some kind of twisted cyberscape, filled with horrific visions, unsettling images, and flat out terrifying sonic assaults. If you think you know dark ambient, think again. 'Dreams in Moving Space' makes 'Stalker' seem like 'have a nice nap' music. Whether or not you'll like it is dependent on your ability to withstand some of the most grim and unsettling music available. If nightmares scare you, I'd leave this one alone. This is a ride on a hellbound train. Just be glad you can get back by just switching your CD player off - I hope.\" (Wind & Wire)\n\"Dreams in Moving Space\" and \"Space Icon\" extend the seemingly limitless boundaries that such electronic kosmische sound explorers as \"Cluster\" and early \"Tangerine Dream\" mapped out during the early 70s: music that has been vacuum packed and initially sounds devoid of human involvement, until the slow motion groove suddenly takes hold. We've been here before many times, but one can only admire the precision-jewelled artistry and technological skill that Artemiev, Klinger and Frohmader have employed to create these dark, shifting rumbles from deep space that sound starkly modern, but also unfathomably ancient.\" (The Wire)\n\"I don't know who Phillip B. Klingler is and an internet search turned up nothing. But this release is more an exploration of sounds than mood and imagery. The resulting atmosphere is dark and the music is similar to 'Point of Intersection' and, to a lesser degree, \"Mysticism of Sound\", though it lacks the intensity that I enjoyed so much on 'Mysticism...'. The themes don't vary much, the musicians setting a fixed course around which they slowly assemble their orchestra of sound. Actually this is probably the most abstract of Artemiev's recordings I've heard yet, particularly the relatively short track 'Between People, or Within', a five minute primoridial soup of spacey banging, static, and industrial sounds. Short, but to the point, and my favorite track on the disc. 'Murmurs Across the Surface' is the track that comes closest to qualifying for inclusion on 'Mysticism of Sound', another voyage into the darkest (and freakiest!) corners of space.\" (Aural Innovations)\n\"Artemiy Artemiev has been releasing for a few years now music that is always at the border of electronic and electroacoustics, both in the spirit of 'Tangerine Dream' and Francis Dhomont. From CD to CD, he is building a dreamlike world, trippy, mystical ('Mysticism of Sound'), sometimes cold (like on \"Cold\") and these days a lot more disquieting than usual. Because 'Dreams in Moving Space' is a lot less positive and spirited than its cousins. Is it the influence of Phillip B. Klingler (of whom I know nothing about) who collaborated on this last opus? One thing is sure, on the title track (22 minutes), one can hear disquieting sounds, eeries complaints that would be at home as the soundtrack for a haunted house ride. In 'Lost Souls in Bamboo Jungle', I had distinctly heard voices calling for help through the noises of a cybernetic jungle. Stunning. Artemiev and Klingler offer cinematic music anchored in electronics, to which they added electracoustical elements. This record is in continuity with Artemiev's previous, 'Space Icon', with Peter Frohmader, less the space pulse (except for the past track on 'Dreams...', with a more dirving beat). A deranged ambient disc with rich textures. Maybe Artemiev's best release to date. Very strongly recommended.\" (Delire Actuel)\n\"Shifting expectations again, Artemiy Artemiev has teamed up with Phillip B. Klinger for this new album, though to my untutored ears it is difficult to tell who contributes what in this collaboration. Part one of the eponymous title track is certainly dreamlike, though with its industrial sounds it seems more like a nightmare scenario. 'Lost Souls in Bamboo Jungle' has a 'Twilight Zone' feel to it: disembodied voices, distorted clock chimes, floorboard and door creakings, all over an ambient backdrop. The shortest track, 'Between People or Within', is also the most discordant and least likeable. 'Murmurs Across the Surface' continues the industrial sounds with what sounds like a distant thundering factory floating around in space. Final track is Part Two of 'Dreams in Moving Space', subtitled the Moscow Mix, more dreamy electronica drones with a touch of backbeat. I have to admit this isn't one of my favourite AA albums, it is a little too industrial sounding for my tastes, but it does have its fair share of moments.\" (The Borderland)\n\"Artemiev is currently represented by a slew of releases that are appearing every year. 'Dreams in Moving Space' sees him teaming up with American, Klingler, who normally records under the name PBK (his initials). 'Dreams... ' is a CD that I wish were a round table. How come? Because I feel I'm up against a brick wall with this kind of project. 'The Space Icon' album had me very optimistic, hungry for more thoughtful and introspective music from Artemiev. But here I was disappointed. Five super-long tracks fill the bill, but none of them seemed to get anywhere or say anything. Thick dense droning waves of grungey noise pervades half of the work, but that is a compliment compared to other parts, where it was merely noise... other spots add a bit of classicism - slightly more atmospheric and easier on the ear to be sure. But the repetitive nature of the structures, and the (intentionally?) messy demeanor of the arrangements were impenetrable for someone of my taste. Not the sort of project that I can make much sense of I am afraid to say.\" (Expose)\n\"Philip B. Klinger (aka PBK, an obscure American artist with lots of weird industrial electronics releases in the late 1980's) joins Artemiy for one of the very best of his releases yet. This is dark and spooky ambient music, a richly melodic diversion from the isolationist school, full of mysterious reverberated sounds, long synthetic tones and unusual (slightly) rhythmic structures. Only occasionally does it gain any normal focus, and when it does, the use of rhythm machine does let musical ambience down a bit, particularly on 'Dreams in Moving Space. Part II (Moscow Mix)' the album's 16 minute closer, where the rhythm has the feel as though it's coming from another room (Is someone playing a horrible techno record next-door?) and doesn't really fit in with the music. Overall though it's a rather good album.\" (Audion)\n\"The last release (so far!) is 'Dreams In Moving Space' (ELCD 014). This, again, is co-written with Artemiy and Phillip B. Klingler. Now this is more like it! The opening track, 'Dreams In Moving Space. Part I' features swirling mists of synth with a back wash of sound effects and noises that, in effect, creates a superbly evocative piece. It drifts, constantly ebbing and flowing, and the use of the odd industrial clanging and banging adds a certain gravity. Intensely eerie. 'Lost Souls in Bamboo Jungle' has eastern sounds in there, but not as many as I thought it would (especially with a title like that!). Voices echo through a bubbling, writhing synth with sliding cymbals and it all gives the feeling of one of those strange dreams that stay with you for years - again, a very strange and absorbing piece. 'Between People, or Within' is the next track. This is a somewhat more structured piece in that there's a beat that keeps coming in and out of the piece. It drips with really odd sound effects and sounds, at times, like something from Stockhausen. 'Murmurs Across the Surface' brought images straight away of 2001, why? It was a sense of isolation that the track sends out, and reminded me of the trip through the star gate, especially near the end of the journey. A swirling backwash of synth with a odd industrial clanging boom beats out whilst a string style section sings mournfully. A very touching piece. The final track is the 'Moscow Mix (Part 2)' of the title track. It's a bit more soothing and ambient, although there's still a certain something lurking, a desperate nastiness hiding in those shadows. Classic album. Best of the batch by far. Anyone wanting to find out more about any of 'Electroshock Records' may well get it from www.gamma-shop.com\" (Modern Dance)\n\"A really interesting meeting that of these two creators of universes of sound. The American Phillip B. Klinger, better known by his artistic name PBK, started an interesting career in the musical avantgarde of the late eighties. His music, between Ambient and Minimalism, soon attracted a remarkable attention given the eminently sinister character that PBK achieved without resorting to typically bleak sound effects. That extraordinary and so unusual skills are joined in this album with the talent that Russian composer Artemiy Artemiev has to create complex, dark atmospheres of sound. Explorers of fathomless musical abysses, both artists offer us a work of electronic music of a deeply experimental nature, with passages which could be labelled within Ambient and others nearer to the structures of Concrete Music.\" (Amazing Sounds)\n\"This year (2000) wasn't exactly the best year for ambient music, though it was a good year for electro-acoustic reissues. While a lot of people were excited, including myself, about the new Biosphere, it was sadly lacking ambience in spite of techno pulsations. Even new Aube (with his impressive one-CD-a-month millennium project), Nocturnal Emissions and Yen Pox releases were lacking, or just very different. But one of the brightest lights of ambient music this year was Artemiy Artemiev's electro-acoustic collaboration with Phillip B. Klingler. A vast, musical/anti-musical panorama, proves that electro-acoustic and ambient music styles still have plenty of life left in them. Pick this up and impress Your friends by telling them that it's Russian. In a year with a number of both solo efforts and collaborations at the hands of Artemiev on his Electroshock Records label, spanning a variety of styles from a kind of Krautrock/space rock guitar work to moody electronics, this one is a subtle, unique blessing in the ambient genre, and one, I doubt, with any particular intent - save for creating dream-inspired pieces. Artemiy, son of infamous Russian electro-acoustic innovator Edward, works with a variety of sounds and techniques, using whatever he comes across that suits his needs. In this case, Artemiy and Klingler borrow elements of sci-fi film scores, folding them into new visions, while at the same time taking turns with musique concrete, electro-acoustic, ambient, and even break beats (on the 'Moscow Mix' of 'Dreams in Moving Space. Part II'). The album ventures between electro-acoustics and electronics, to create a drifting, oceanic vista of sounds, both mired in a sort of collective consciousness memory, and in a vast panoramic future. Each work pushes in surprising directions. Sparse melodies and drift and collide between affected field recordings; sounds break down to reveal silence, which is abruptly covered by drones; melody turns into drone; patterns are revealed in discordant, fractured field recordings; beats come out to direct the flow of sound in 'Dreams in Moving Space. Part II', but are in no way obtrusive. Artemiy shows that he is able to work with and expound on Krautrock styles on one album, and abandon those for an electro-acoustic style on another, all of which tends to show a number of similarities to the creations of his father, but with a unique style all his own. This is the kind of subtle ambience that is the perfect background music -involving enough to actively listen to, but texturally smooth enough to keep on behind your thoughts and ears when you're doing something else.\" (Supersphere)\n\"Five quite long compositions in this brand new collaboration. Anyway, it seems to me that the sound and the feeling coming out of them is more 'wicked' somehow, more noisy and tending to picture sinister soundscapes, with the use of samples and concrete sounds, and with the use of wide dynamic climaxes which keep the tension high for the whole length of the record. Actually, the 'spacial' side of this music has been heavily emphasised, and as the title of the compositions themselves suggest, they really seem to be transfigurations of movements, or passages in real, or mental, environments.\" (D.L.K.)\n\"Dreams\" presents two long eponymous tracks (the second of which is entitled 'Moscow Mix') as well as three others of varying lengths - although the 'Moscow Mix' offsets a beat against the lowering cumulus of noise that masses behind it, this is a sombre collection of pieces on the whole, invoking the point at which one's longings turn jet black. With a hint of Eno's 'The Lost Day', and of some of Ligeti's slower pieces ('Lontano', the first movement of the Cello Concerto), coming through in the mix, it does so with an intensity, and a care for the color of sound, that makes this a wholly successful work.\" (Stride)\n\"Ambient music is magical due to the fact that it can create any mood or feeling and transport the mind to any location within the imagination. With 'Dreams in Moving Space', I expected to find myself within the limitless area dreamy space but instead had my subconscious picked clean of twisted thoughts and childhood nightmares. One of the first tests I give to ambient music is the 'sleep test'. I put it in, drift off to sleep, and see where the music guides my dreams and thoughts. At first, everything was okay. The sleepy winds of 'Dreams in Moving Space. Part I' floated from my speakers and placed me adrift on the ocean. Just as I began to enter my dream state, the music took a slight twist and I began to hear small shots of static and other weird noises placed sporadically within the music. My dreams quickly twisted and became bizarre and I forced myself to wake up and turn it off. That was a world I did not wish to enter because I needed a good nights rest. 'Dreams in Moving Space' is an album filled with this type of music. It is the soundtrack to your nightmares. With only five songs, it clocks in at an amazing 74:32 so you definitely get your money's worth. It is dreamy music, but it has been tainted and tortured with static, running water, human cries and voices, and many other sound effects. These effects give the impression that they are all under some sort of stress and cause the listener to become anxious, nervous, and finally downright frightened. Artemiy and Phillip have done a wonderful job of giving dreamy ambient music a set of claws. This is not a CD to be left alone with while locked in a pitch-black room. If you are a fan of ambient music or a writer trying to pry creepy and bizarre ideas from your brain, this is a must have. It's too easy to loop a sample over and over and call it music to sleep by but to find the right atmosphere for turning a dream into a nightmare takes true insight and talent. All music composed, arranged, performed, recorded, engineered, and mixed by Artemiy Artemiev and Phillip B. Klingler.\" (Satrvox)\n\"This CD is a collaboration between Artemiy Artemiev and Phillip B. Klingler (PBK). The music was made between September 1998 and February 2000. There's five songs in here. We open things up with \"Dreams in Moving Space. Part 1\". It is a sound voyage through outer worldly realms. You hear processed sounds and soft synth lines, slowly drifting away. A dreamy portrait of space indeed. On \"Lost Souls in Bamboo Jungle\" there's processed sounds/voice, synth with echo and reverb thrown in. A cosmic, psychedelic, meditative track. Definitely strange. On \"Between People, or Within\" you hear various sound sources colliding altogether. The \"noisiest\" piece of this album. An interesting brand of meditative cacophony. \"Murmurs Across the Surface\" brings a more peaceful note. A near-ambient song with \"musique concrete\" undertones. Relaxing. Then, we conclude with \"Dreams of Moving Space. Part 2 (Moscow Mix)\": synth mixed with some percussions. It is soft ambient music of cosmic proportions. Simply marvelous!!! An amazing release, no doubt.\" (Mastock)\n\"A collaborative CD with mostly excellent results from Artemiy Artemiev and PBK. Part I of the title track is moody dark ambient music which creates an atmosphere of entrapment inside an underwater craft whilst surrounded by falling debris. The despair of the situation is superbly installed into the thoughts by the slow moving, foreboding drones and submerged icy cold sounds. A formidable piece of music. Part II (Moscow Mix) of this track adds a rhythmic beat to the suspense. Quite frankly it distracts and overpowers the track. \"Lost Souls in Bamboo Jungle\" is rhythmic dark ambience with shadowy sounds and resonating voices. A marvelous piece of music that gives the impression that the voices are in a state of distress, crying out for help. \"Between People, or Within\" is a short piece of rhythmic, dark, abstract noises. A non-eventful, mediocre piece of music. \"Murmurs Across the Surface\" takes the listener into the pandemonic abyss. A sinister, awe-inspiring, unearthly masterpiece. Overall this collaboration gives the listener over 50 minutes of excellent, captivating, dark, ambient electronics. I think that deserves a recommendation.\" (Lockjaw)\n\"Artemiy Artemiev did not pop up yesterday or a week ago but has worked hard for his position for many years and even being the son of Edward Artemiev, a renowned pioneer of electronica in the former USSR did not make it much easier for him. Many of the things that come from Russia, be it works of technology or works of culture, tend to be underrated and looked down upon by the self-important West and this also seems to be so with Artemiev's music, quite undeservedly, though. The two albums in question are the fruit of collaboration of Artemiev with Frohmader and Klingler and both are evident that we have to do with composers of a remarkably high order. They are hard to be slotted into a single, narrow pigeon-hole and to be juxtaposed with somebody else's works for the purpose of comparison, which reviewers are so fond of. Nonetheless, some words need to be found to ring but a vague bell as regards to what the compositions are about, and the very first term that comes to mind while listening to \"Dreams\" is \"isolationism\", which denotes a score to films that are being shot within our minds. The effect is much similar to that of Lustmord's compositions but here the range of means applied is more varied. Artemiev and Klingler are more dynamic, the aural landscape with dark undercurrents flows and ebbs away. \"Space Icon\" sounds more relaxed and as if \"human\" - it is occasionally interwoven with beats and the first track is dominated by guitar but the ubiquitous void and lethal coldness of Space do not let themselves be forgotten. Very recommended, albeit might prove difficult to obtain.\" (ERP)\n\"Overwhelming feelings of fear and foreboding suffuse the first collaboration between Russian electroacoustic composer Artemiy Artemiev and the American sound collagist Phillip B. Klinger, a/k/a PBK. This is an uncomfortable, deeply weird disc, even more out-there than Artemiev's previous release, the abundantly strange \"Mysticism of Sound\". Egged on by PBK, whose circle of fiends includes \"The Swans\" and other practioners of black arts, Artemiev moves further towards anti-music than ever before. \"Between People, or Within\", a burnt-boneyard of smeared, razored sound, is parsecs away from the lush, formalistic grooves of 1993's \"The Warning\". Although more melodic, \"Murmurs Across the Surface\" is nevertheless a waking nightmare, a procession of terror urged by distant, alien drums. And for you club kids, the breakbeat-infected \"Moscow Mix\" reprise of the title track will surely harsh your mellow. Rave on, you crazy diamond! The textures of this record are remarkable; there are moments when the music seems to melt, rust and crack open. Hard to describe, even on drugs. You've just got to hear it. Hailed as a triumph by the sort of folks who never discuss music at their day jobs, \"Dreams In Moving Space\" left me stunned and speechless.\" (Demo Universe)",

            "about": "Released as a limited edition cdr on Power Silence, 2009.\nOn this CD, (PBK) collaborates with Geary Roe II, an artist I’m not so familiar with, and according to the description, this is somewhat of a concept album revealing the inner psyche of the Fritzl case in Austria, where Josef Fritzl held his daughter captive for 24 years in his cellar, subjecting her to all forms of rape, torture, and sexual abuse. This resulted in the birth of seven children, 3 of which lived normal lives raised by him and his wife upstairs, and 3 of which were imprisoned and abused with their mother. One infant died days after birth as he cut off all medical help, and cremated the baby in his house. He was arrested just last year. What could cause someone to do something like this to their own kin? This CD has no tangible answers, but in a slight flash of perhaps anger, is merely an auditory reflection into the gruesome mental workings of the disturbed human being.\nAs stated before, texture is the name of the game here, and originally this CD was a compilation of improvised studio sessions between PBK and Roe, arranged and selected by PBK and edited for this album. Sounds have been carefully chosen to accurately depict the oppressive atmosphere of the cellar Elisabeth Fritzl was imprisoned in, and the sheer despair and horror she and her offspring must have felt, as this story is nothing short of sheer horror unto itself. Told with this album, it becomes that much more frightening. If one could tag this album, it would definitely qualify to serve the tastes of the dark ambient and death industrial fan.\nRight off we begin with some rather disturbing clinking and clanking noises on the first track, “Nocturnal Sign”, a desperate and psychotic track of scraping fingernails, muffled groans, banging, squirming….. quite possibly throwing us into an early rape scene befween Josef and Elisabeth, while his wife passively ignores it. The pain, the fear, it’s all there in the desire to escape, and right away we get the feeling we are aurally being smothered with a pillow, locked away in a small, claustrophobic space, forcefully invaded against our will.\n“Washing Away of Wrongs”, a relatively silent industrial drone of being alone, of contemplation, and with the rising of scraping metallic voices, slowly going mad. Like the misfiring ends of a broken wire, these metal sounds start burrowing their way into your cerebrum out of the dark abyss that is your remorse, locked away behind the stone cold door of self-justification. Ringing of bells brings us out of our demented reverie and fantasies of what we could do to our captive into the outside world, as we go on…. pretending to live a normal life.\n“Cocoon”. The ultimate stare into the eyes of despair. Trapped in a dungeon to live out our remaining days. The responsibility of caring for children you know are damned to your own fate, never to see the outside world. This track is one of the more dark ambient-type tracks on this album, painting a bleak picture of the inside of your cell, it’s many shadowy corners, it’s various functions, a lifetime of hell waiting for you every day.\n“Heaved and Bore Him His” could be the soundtrack of the infant’s death, starting out with some ghostly tones and tinny scraping sounds. An infant left alone without medical care, slowly suffocating to death, as the track moves onto darker territory. Things begin to move in the dark, crackling of things crunching underfoot, a distant machine starting up and gradually growing louder, like an incinerator awaiting your disposal. This track gradually moves back into manic grief, full of looped voices and shifting sounds coming out of your sanity, as utter remorse sets in for what you’ve done, though now it’s far too late to change what you are. Some more ghostly melodies come in and start the cycle again, knowing you must go on, the outside world must never know of your sin. This track is one mad ride through a CD full of madness.\nThrough the rest of the CD, you’re treated to one disturbing soundscape after another, with very little melody to serve as comfort. This CD highlights two points of view, of both captive and captor. We go through sounds and textures ranging from the serene to the outright abrupt and frightening, but with never one ounce of compassion or warmth. There is no way out of this cellar, and when you finally do get out, you will be driven so mad, that the outside world will be no less a dungeon than this cellar.\nConsequently, the two atmospheres that make up the entirety of this release are a very close, oppressive, claustrophobic one, of being jammed inside a small space; and one of a persistent, continuing descent into total madness, being driven farther away from reality each day, until the nightmare of yourself, the beast, is all you have left.\nDefinitely one of the darker forays into ambient territory by one Philip B. Klingler! I recommend this one to all fans of dark ambient, noise, death industrial, or experimental soundtrack music in general. This one is not so much surrealistic, as it is a direct soundtrack to a tragedy. This would make a very fitting soundtrack to some sort of obscure psychological horror movie. (Heathen Harvest)\n\"Phillip Klingler and fellow sound artist Geary Roe II collaborate here on a highly-abstracted 78-minute set of dense textures and fairly dark sound manipulations. Sequenced by PBK from a series of live improvisations, \"F\" is a proposed soundtrack to the mind of Hans Fritzl, the Austrian beast who kidnapped, imprisoned, and raped his daughter for 24 years. Not that this is some kind of morbid set of \"industrial\" music stereotypes, though. Not knowing the gory details/thematic intentions, the \"F\" CD is mostly ambient noise -- not a lot of jarring sounds, but mostly deeply collaged compositions, likely from manipulated electronics and circuit-bending. The CD itself has precious little info, in fact practically making this an anonymous release.\" (Goatsden)",

            "about": "Released as a CD on Realization Records, 1992.\n\"A collaboration between two of modern experimental music's more inventive sound sculptors, 'Five Manifestoes' is what could be termed 'ambient noise', as these are two artists who manipulate and process natural and synthetic sound into new configurations. 'Manifesto One' is a grating wall of piercing tones, while 'Manifesto Four' is a fleeting sky of atmosphere-soothing but hinting at a storm on the horizon. While this work retains aspects of both artists' solo work, the whole is obviously a collaboration, with both artists having an equal contribution to the tracks. Fans of either artist will find this a fulfilling experience, and though this is an abstract type of sound construction, bits and pieces of structure seem to creep through the tense and often abrasive atmospherics. A marvelous recording and more than recommended.\" (Godsend)",

            "about": "\"Forming Mankind In My Own Image\" — a collaborative split release from 1990 with the brilliant Tim Vickers(Deaf Lions) on several tracks. Originally released as a limited cassette (only a few copies made it out into the world), this remastered edition uncovers the murky, brooding energy we captured over 30 years ago. Expect deep drones/noises, bell tones, sweeping ambient passages, and the unmistakable textures of Tim’s Roland Juno synth and throat singing. My newly acquired Yamaha DX made its debut on this tape, contributing sharp-edged sounds that hint at the internal tension running beneath these tracks. This one feels like unearthing a long-lost artifact — both mysterious and volatile.\nReleased as a cassette in 1990 on PBK Recordings.",

            "about": "Released as a split tape with Vidna Obmana on ND Recordings, 1991.\n\"The 3rd Fragment release continues to demonstrate its commitment to the world of sound by presenting tape and word packages of networking artists. This issue features the ambient work of Vidna Obmana, whose delicate soundscapes capture the feelings of Eno atmospheres with subtle fragility, and PBK whose work is rhythmic in the oddest sense, using familiar samples as sound devices in unlikely punctual ways. The booklet attached to a cardboard foldover, contains interviews with both artists, focusing on their intent, and upcoming projects, and ends with a thought-provoking piece by Jupitter-Larsen entitled 'Frequency'.\" (Factsheet Five)\n\"Exceptionally well-done packaging and production (not at all surprising coming from ND magazine and the artists involved). Both artists give a sampling of their sound work- Vidna Obmana's ambient background/mood music and PBK's odd sampled, clattering, clanking noise collages - all very inspiring and enjoyable listening. Exceptional.\" (Godsend)",

            "about": "Originally released on Humanhood Recordings in 2018. Label statement: \"Heat On Earth\" features a quartet of international experimental musicians comprised of PBK, Mark Spybey, John Butcher and Travis Johnson. Spybey's lush rhythmic settings seem to have been influenced by his work with members of Can, they pulsate and swell as other sounds envelope them in a drone. John Butcher utilizes electronics to extend the potentials of sound on his saxophone, multiplying split-tones into abstract orchestras and using slap tongue techniques to create exotic percussion sounds. A highlight here, Travis Johnson's brilliant contributions on the cello using bowing, scraping and other extended techniques while recording in the Floridian environment with the sound of insects and frogs. PBK's ambient textures, noise and electronics fill in the spaces with dark forms and brooding colors. The result is a unique hybrid of krautrock, free jazz and post-industrial music.\nARTIST BIO'S\nMark Spybey:\nBorn 1961, North Yorkshire, United Kingdom. Spybey was a member of the legendary experimental group, Zoviet France and later, the industrial band Download (with cEvin Key of Skinny Puppy). He has also collaborated with bands such as Can, Not Breathing, James Plotkin, Pigface, Legendary Pink Dots, Mick Harris and many others. He is currently working under the moniker, Dead Voices On Air. DVOA blends processed sound from primitive instruments and toys into rhythmic structures or dark clusters of ambient sound.\nTravis Johnson\nBorn 1979, Florida, USA.\nJohnson began experimenting with radios, tapes and open circuits as a child, inspired by the work of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop for Doctor Who and also by the rural isolation of his Suwannee County, Florida home. He is a multi-instrumentalist who works with stringed instruments as well as synthesizers and varied electronics. Even when playing an acoustic stringed instrument, his approach is informed primarily by electronic and electroacoustic music. He has curated several labels, including Ilse and Poverty Electronics.\nJohn Butcher\nBorn 1954, Brighton, United Kingdom.\nButcher had in mind to become a physicist and actually began his Ph.D. before turning to music full-time. Self-taught on the tenor and soprano saxophones since the late '70s, he began to play jazz, both conventional and unorthodox, while attending university in Surrey. A boundless improviser with a long list of collaborators that includes Derek Bailey, Eddie Prévost/AMM, Keiji Haino, Matthew Shipp, and many others. Butcher has used electronics to extend the possibilities of his voice on the saxophone while exploring split tones/overtones and also moving into silence and microsound.\nPhillip B. Klingler\nBorn 1960, Michigan, USA\nKlingler, better known as PBK, has been active in the experimental music underground since the 1980's. His work first became known via the U.S. independent cassette culture scene. A restless composer with equal interest in noise and ambient music, he has worked with many of the most respected names in experimental music including Asmus Tietchens, Jim O'Rourke, Vidna Obmana and Wolf Eyes. Using extreme turntable manipulation, sampling, analog/digital synthesis, Klingler's soundwork can be noisy, droning and oppressive but can also contain ambient textures and, at other times, aspects of glitch.",

PBK's electronic sculpturings are organic in feel, falling far from the often-mechanical/technical shortcomings of similar artists. PBK successfully manipulates/redesigns sounds, both natural and synthetic, creating entirely new universes, with each track distinctive and uniquely personal. Alien soundtracks teeming with life. Excellent and well-recommended.\" (Godsend)\n\"I was quite surprised to learn that this isn’t a recent release; in fact this was the second release of PBK’s music on the Texan ND label in 1994. Although he describes this album on his website as uncompromising, it seems to be more in the vein of abstracted, disarticulated and deconstructed noise, along with ripples and sharp scattershot explosions, and not the unimaginative senses-nullifying jet-engine blast that I initially thought it would be. No indeed, here we have some very cleverly constructed tapestries and tableaux of freezing cold malignity and purgatorial heat – one imagines that Torquemada would have been quite at home here. Klingler hasn’t just edited sounds together haphazardly; there’s an unnervingly calculated feeling about this, guaranteed to elicit deep despair, revulsion, biliousness and disquiet on every level.\nThis CD isn’t, as initial impressions would indicate, two separate albums put onto one disc – in actuality it’s one single piece divided into two movements, which are further subdivided into seven and six tracks respectively. Unlike many noise artists PBK isn’t afraid of roping in hints of other genres in order to perfectly encapsulate his vision; we have swatches of dark ambient (for instance the grind of wheels and milling voices of ‘Fly and Cross’), Eno-esque ambience mixed with disembodied screech and pattering (‘Open the Circle’), the looped musique-concrète of ‘Wind-licked Flames’, the monolithic engine aesthetic of ‘The System’, the glacial ambient crackling of ‘Mind Inflamed’ and the minimalist poppings and cracker detonations of torment. His sheer range exemplifies the utter craftsmanship with which he has put this together – moreover there’s a natural intelligence at work here that some would consider to be bordering on supernatural intuition, every element falls easily into its allotted place and every sound is well-chosen for its ability to summon forth the correct atmosphere and ambience.\nAbove all what you come away with from this is deep and unutterable isolation, an existence where pain, sorrow and paranoia are everyday companions – there is no light here, in fact there never has been light and there never will be either. This is a vision of the deepest and most unpleasant level of Hell, where the greatest punishment is not consignment to the flames but sentenced to an eternity of abject and cold loneliness; and not just physical loneliness but complete spiritual separation and isolation, a dark place where one’s soul could wander for all time and still not meet another. This is the greatest fear of the living that we will live and die without the essential contact of others like us; how much more keenly is it felt by those restless ghosts whose earthly bodies have left the source of warmth and solace. Furthermore, if there is any promise that’s been made here, it is that this is the destination for us all, saint and sinner alike, and that no matter how much praying and gnashing of teeth is performed, nothing’s going to change, so get used to it. Freezingly cold and deeply pessimistic and more to the point uncompromisingly so, just like the man said.... and that’s exactly how I like it.\" (Heathen Harvest)\n\"Why do listen to something else when PBK exists??? Impossible to render all atmosphere within and thoughts coming during the process. PBK deals with ambient noise and industrial concreteness covered under entirely unbearing sonic outbursts. Nearly to 70 minutes around music are testing the possibility of human limits. All 13 things are supported by electronic and exclusively instrumental. Free your mind and let the noise manipulate it. As strong as can't be imagined, so take care...\" (Calmant)",

            "about": "Released as a compact disc on Lunhare (Italy), 1996.\nReviews:\n\"There are creations in art history, which can‘t be rated by time. Such is the creation by PBK (Phillip B. Klingler) and his album 'Life-Sense Revoked', created in the end of last century. The listener can‘t know anything about artist‘s biography, about context of this album, but can feel timeless ideas. It is experimental and ageless work of it‘s special abstract noisy ground of sound and conceptual point of theme.\nTracks are various, not so similar, every has individual melody, sounds and touch with artist‘s inner goals. All of them express dark world of human being, but some of them are more in good mood, some – in more dark. Names of tracks, like of album, remind dadaistic play with words and meanings. For example, 'Beauty's Punishment'. Short, but catching song about beauty and it‘s other dark side. Another similar song is 'Courage Collage'. Idea of this work, like of all album, can be interpreted in many meanings - just playing with words and musical sounds or it is more deeply or both at the same time. In these two songs dominates memorable woman voice, which captures the attention and sounds pleasantly. These tracks remind view of perfomance‘s aesthetics. More different are other tracks with more noisy sounds. Two tracks about 'State Of Flux' make feel this state, but this process is not even hard and uncomfortable. The first version is more tender of sounds, the second has more strident noises, like good and bad side of flux. About similar process of moving is 'Nekritskan Encapsulate', 'Shimmering Substance' songs. The names of tracks help to imagine these processes more clearly.\nMore ambient songs are 'Crime Of Trespass', 'To Wish, To Contradict', 'Outside Of Time' and 'Cabalistic Personage'. In their dominates steady melody with some noisy sounds. Similar is and the first song 'Thugadeno', but with more noisy steady melody and harsh noises. This song is extented in the last and the longest song 'Cabalistic Personage', which maybe summarizes all tracks in one progressive deep noise ambient and tree of life meaning.\n'Life-Sense Revoked' name can be interpreted and named like one of successful ventures to represent what is not visible by eyes in last life of art, but live and important in nowadays. There can be mentioned felicitous words of Joseph Beuys (German conceptualist artist): 'I didn‘t care to appeal to logic, I care to open all traces in subliminal mind and to make them mix by form of chaotic process, for everything, which is new, the beginning is always chaotic'.\" (Heathen Harvest)\n\"More excellent abstracted sound sculptures from this amazing artist, including some collaborative pieces with Jarboe, Hands To, AMK, and Brian Ladd. Some truly unique and varied sonic textures here, easily transcending the boundaries between experimental noise and soundtrack styles.\" (Godsend)",

            "about": "Chain Letter Exhortation Series, #6\nThe Chain Letter Exhortation Series explores the idea of creating an audio composition and passing it from one participant to another while adding to, modifying and remixing the structure. Unlike the \"Exquisite Corpse\", where each artist places their contribution where the last artist's works ends, in the \"chain\" each artist listens to and decides how to integrate with or subvert the entire structure at their whim. There are no set rules. The process is dictated by each participant, there could be close collaboration between participants, discussions of direction and methodology, or there might be none of that. The personality stamp of the individual may be strong, or might be closer to anonymity.\nThe \"chain letter\" concept began in the late 50's via the mail-art movement. One of its most ardent devotees was Detroit-born, Ray Johnson.\n\"The enigmatic Neo-Dada collagist... Johnson’s stock-in-trade was benevolent chain letters asking recipients if they would kindly add something to what was already enclosed and pass the updated artwork (often an irreverent collage) along to someone new. He didn’t care about getting the letters back so much as giving them long and eventful lives, with many idiosyncratic transformations along the way.\" (Smithsonian, 2018)\n\"By concentrating on mail art, with its invitation to alter the work by whomever receives it, he refused to create a body of work that exhibited a narrative arc of his own 'development.' That productive repudiation carries forward the only motive of the avant-garde that really matters anymore: undoing Western culture’s ever-widening separation of one’s life (living) from one’s art (making).\" (Hyperallergic, 2015)\nLater, the idea was taken up by audio artists working in the cassette underground who would exchange tapes from artist to artist to mix and remix. \"International Mail-Music Group\" with Al Margolis, Bogart, Rafael Flores and Yutaka Tanaka (1986), and \"Chain Mail Collab\" with Das Ubuibi, Jeph Jerman, John Hudak and PBK (1988) both exemplify the four-way collaboration approach used for the Chain Letter Exhortation Series. For purposes of study, the separate mixes are included with the digital download.",

            "about": "Released as a compact disc on ND Recordings, 1992.\nReviews:\n\"What I've always liked about PBK's work is his sense of spectral distribution in his compositions. While many noise artists tend to bungle about leaving out big chunks of the audio spectrum and still other noisicians have no regard for this spectral quality and simply fill up every imaginable frequency with sheer volume supplying you with eternal white or pink noise, PBK has a sensitivity that elevates his work to a different class. PBK's recordings are passages in time, where frequency components travel from instant to instant, intermarry and spontaneously reproduce new composites of themselves. Never is there a neglected frequency, yet the sounds are always fundamental enough to be discreet elements of composition. His recordings consist of brief source noises which are processed and layered repeatedly, unfolding and evolving before you. His work has correctly been compared to Asmus Tietchens, and indeed the two were briefly married on the '91 release, 'Five Manifestoes'. This cd is actually two works, and they continue in the direction described above. 'Macrophage\" is the harder of the two, while 'The Toil And The Reap\" is much more pastoral. My favorite piece on 'Macrophage' is 'Onset', where he uses a synth to create an atmospheric reference and has all kinds of noises gathering and crashing gently, in a way that is reminiscent of Sema's harsher work. The following piece, 'Aftermath', continues this trend, but the noise sources dominate as if they have won some kind of private war. 'The Toil And The Reap\" is a very romantic and surreal work, bearing titles such as 'Eyelids Closed, As In A Dream', 'Beckoning', and 'Poison Sweets Of Love'. Vidna Obmana, a long-time friend of PBK and former collaborator, makes a guest appearance on 'Beckoning'. While 'Toil' indicates a continuing development in the manipulation of noise, there is also a trend toward the use of traditional instrumentation as well. This work is a green and fertile landscape turned eerie gray and silver by the most beautiful storm clouds imaginable. I think the wind is picking up.\" (Audio Drudge)\n\"This first CD by PBK (excluding the CD with Asmus Tietchens) divides into two sections, but there isn't substantial disparity between them. 'Macrophage' has in the foreground more dark noises, extreme loops, metal clangours, destructive dins... In this first part there isn't a real development of the compositions, all the songs are complete in their compactness, they are power atoms, perfect in their circularity. Whereas in 'The Toil And The Reap\" there is the working out of the sonorities in the various tracks; there are also sampled sounds near the noise, the echoes of millenary crashes of meteorites, the infinite running after each other of destruction's moments... but all is in motion. A way flows from a sound, and it develops in all the tracks, with a perfect continuity. In 'Eyelids Closed, As In A Dream' it's being oneiric allows to travel towards unknown dimensions; In 'Beckoning', Vidna Obmana's participation makes still stronger the enchanted call towards the unknown.\" (Batty's Tears)\n\"Macrophage combines stormy walls of sound with muffled rhythms; sounding at one point like a mechanized torture chamber filled with horses trotting around, but The Toil and the Reap is more conventional, mixing dangerous ambience with insistent electronics.\" (EST)\n\"Dense, ambient noise wash compositions that gush into white noise territory on currents of searing Learjet backblast and automated cinderblock factory malfunction. Falling asleep to this is challenging, though the Toil portion, from an older recording session, seeps into spacier territory--particularly \"Beckoning\", a collaboration with Belgian electronic composer Vidna Obmana. Ominous and complex music, packaged in a beautifully designed cardstock sleeve with raised, embossed design on the front cover.\" (Reign Of Toads)",

            "about": "Recorded 1997. Released as a cassette on PBK Recordings, 1997.\n\"A tape of tremblingly calm neuro-weirdness from abstract sound master, PBK, created while under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs. PBK once again creates a work that is so far out of the field of 'normal\" sound that the music itself is often less describable than the imaginary visions it summons: being swallowed down a quivering esophagus. A rising flood of jangling water and popping metallic bubbles, flowing less like water than like a tumbling swarm of insectoid robots. A floating host of angeldogs chanting strict regulations from behind canvas curtains, their vocal cords as big around as streetlamps. Startling jolts from an electronic brain enduring a seizure. A far beyond excellent set of mind-stimulating, challenging sounds to let yourself fall deep into.\" (Autoreverse Magazine)",

            "about": "Originally released as a cassette in 1990 on PBK Recordings label. Later reissued on Realization Recordings (USA).\nReviews:\n\"Packed with a hand-painted cloth inlay, this latest release by PBK continues his exploration of, ummm, noise. Flowing, churning, developing abstract noise textures. I've no idea how they were created or manipulated: they possess an authentic identity of their own somewhere between electronic, mechanical and environmental noise. PBK's aim is to use this unpromising material to reeducate our ears, show us that noise really is nice. His music has ranged in the past from the musical to the unlistenable, but this cassette is neither: it really does stand on its own merits, as a new listening experience. Post-apocalypse ambient atmospheres.\" (EST)\n\"This cassette network stalwart is slowly (and as surely as endless delay) building a personal sound genre I would like to formally christen 'assault ambience'. Like Crawling With Tarts and a few others currently working in a similar vein, PBK is capable of breathing something lifelike into cold, machinery sound. Nevertheless, cyborgs need not worry, there is nothing very organic about PBK sound. The process of trial and error that the artists endure is likely as close to live action as this stuff gets. His music to soothe your soul and batter your brain comes wrapped in an authentic piece of artwork on canvas.\" (Lowlife)\n\"Quality abstract sound damage from California. Unlike many of today's bands, PBK can rightfully assume the position of 'industrial' music with this release. Mechanized power electronics, like a factory of machines. Approaches a sort of computer-based ambience at times even. Spooky cyberpunk music impeccably recorded & uniquely packaged in a hand painted canvas cover. Very fine effort indeed.\" (Godsend)",

            "about": "Released as a CD on Monochrome Vision, 2008.\nReviews:\n\"This joining of forces of the American sound painter PBK and veteran German experimental group Telepherique here encompasses a fertile creative ground, and is titled more than appropriately, being a playful mesh of softly textural, bizarre and sometimes playful sound compositions. It all begins with the oddly surreal 'Twilight Cue', which sounds like an electro-acoustic collage with samples and recordings of raw metal and primitive percussions (though perhaps more ambient than that description implies). 'In Ecosystem Interrupt' is a mysterious set of sounds that evoke a dramatic cinematic scene in a plastic baggie factory (with strings)...on vinyl! 'My Rare Dreams (Of The Future)' is a more structured, rhythmic mix of atmospheric guitars/bass and skittering, looping sounds, like an old 4AD band being mixed by Stefan Betke/Pole. 'You Only Fade' soundtracks a late-night haunting in a factory, through a pixel haze, whereas 'Seen Through Cloud Cover' closes it out with a spacious ambience. Overall, a heady and quirkily pleasing collision of sounds and abstracted textures.\" (Goatsden)\n\"You most likely do not need a history lesson in the trades PBK, Phillip B. Klinger, and Telepherique, Klaus Jochim et al, but if resume perusal is requirement to employment, you’ll find the inner liner notes’ publicity rap on both acts taken from the CD booklet paragraphed within the internet loquaciously (should you do require a background, please follow aforementioned instructions). This, however, is not a split album but a union of two into one that deserves its own space: they have, after all, entitled the album with that in mind.\nAll the tracks are skewed heavily with eschatological and societal ideation, each nesting poignant subtitle in sentence, from the curtain call of ‘Twilight Cue – The Beginning of an Ending’ to withering query of ‘Sun Continue to Shine – How much longer will the solar energy remain a constant and feed the planet? – a prayer’, libates a future fallen and failed, expressed in word. How ironic then, that it is by the product of oil that both artists illume their ecologically introspective sound.\nSheeted steel screams as they sharpen together, gleaming whips stabbing and shearing. The attacks are random in, The Beginning... (Twilight Cue), where oscillations of sampled cyclic machinery are gutted and howl strange frequencies and rattling gears groan, creak and tense. The palpable pressure expressed in the album, whose most harsh and unrelenting tragedy was finalised before the first track began with the predilection of subsidence of survival – ours and all else, is taught and chaotic. Flickering tones are struck with steel, some force or wind sans life the only animastic force causing such collision. Delving into a planetary disaster with the reversal of the poles, the second track continues in a rich bubble of noise and ambience evoked in the first play, swelling with organic tones and twitching just-around-the-corner malfunctions: haunting visions of violent lifelessness of mechanical repetition.\nThere are seismic changes in the presentation of disaster outlined in the track titles and subtitles. Static squeals accompaniment to shivering bird calls, tortured bicycles screeching like tortured banshees while electronic saccade splutters oblivious. Noise and ambience abet the artists’ amalgamation without excelling or smothering each other, allowing for carefully delineated segments of space between the fused. The interplay, which perhaps an artist of either camp who stubbornly sees no space tween, is one of chiaroscuro.\nMenace and darkness are portrayed, but less as a necessity and more a by-product of what is being evinced, aural statements of ecological disasters, which in today’s day and climate are hardly menacing or dark enough. It is little wonder that such a future and such music treads a lonely path of absence of life save its echoes.\nThe album is a limited edition of 500 disc jewel-case and nothing particularly aesthetically inspiring. A simple and glossy four-page black-on0white booklet is detailed with minimal design angular and ovular.\" (Heathen Harvest)",

            "about": "Chain Letter Exhortation Series, #2\nThe Chain Letter Exhortation Series explores the idea of creating an audio composition and passing it from one participant to another while adding to, modifying and remixing the structure. Unlike the \"Exquisite Corpse\", where each artist places their contribution where the last artist's works ends, in the \"chain\" each artist listens to and decides how to integrate with or subvert the entire structure at their whim. There are no set rules. The process is dictated by each participant, there could be close collaboration between participants, discussions of direction and methodology, or there might be none of that. The personality stamp of the individual may be strong, or might be closer to anonymity.\nThe \"chain letter\" concept began in the late 50's via the mail-art movement. One of its most ardent devotees was Detroit-born, Ray Johnson.\n\"The enigmatic Neo-Dada collagist... Johnson’s stock-in-trade was benevolent chain letters asking recipients if they would kindly add something to what was already enclosed and pass the updated artwork (often an irreverent collage) along to someone new. He didn’t care about getting the letters back so much as giving them long and eventful lives, with many idiosyncratic transformations along the way.\" (Smithsonian, 2018)\n\"By concentrating on mail art, with its invitation to alter the work by whomever receives it, he refused to create a body of work that exhibited a narrative arc of his own 'development.' That productive repudiation carries forward the only motive of the avant-garde that really matters anymore: undoing Western culture’s ever-widening separation of one’s life (living) from one’s art (making).\" (Hyperallergic, 2015)\nLater, the idea was taken up by audio artists working in the cassette underground who would exchange tapes from artist to artist to mix and remix. \"International Mail-Music Group\" with Al Margolis, Bogart, Rafael Flores and Yutaka Tanaka (1986), and \"Chain Mail Collab\" with Das Ubuibi, Jeph Jerman, John Hudak and PBK (1988) both exemplify the four-way collaboration approach used for the Chain Letter Exhortation Series. For purposes of study, the separate mixes are included with the digital download.",

            "about": "Released as a compact disc on ND Recordings, 1994.\nReviews:\n\"Readers of Godsend should no doubt have heard my countless words of praise for this exceptional modern composer whose raw, evocative sound manipulations are easily more interesting than better-known peers like The Hafler Trio. PBK's electronic sculpturings are organic in feel, falling far from the often-mechanical/technical shortcomings of similar artists. PBK successfully manipulates/redesigns sounds, both natural and synthetic, creating entirely new universes, with each track distinctive and uniquely personal. Alien soundtracks teeming with life. Excellent and well-recommended.\" (Godsend)\n\"I was quite surprised to learn that this isn’t a recent release; in fact this was the second release of PBK’s music on the Texan ND label in 1994. Although he describes this album on his website as uncompromising, it seems to be more in the vein of abstracted, disarticulated and deconstructed noise, along with ripples and sharp scattershot explosions, and not the unimaginative senses-nullifying jet-engine blast that I initially thought it would be. No indeed, here we have some very cleverly constructed tapestries and tableaux of freezing cold malignity and purgatorial heat – one imagines that Torquemada would have been quite at home here. Klingler hasn’t just edited sounds together haphazardly; there’s an unnervingly calculated feeling about this, guaranteed to elicit deep despair, revulsion, biliousness and disquiet on every level.\nThis CD isn’t, as initial impressions would indicate, two separate albums put onto one disc – in actuality it’s one single piece divided into two movements, which are further subdivided into seven and six tracks respectively. Unlike many noise artists PBK isn’t afraid of roping in hints of other genres in order to perfectly encapsulate his vision; we have swatches of dark ambient (for instance the grind of wheels and milling voices of ‘Fly and Cross’), Eno-esque ambience mixed with disembodied screech and pattering (‘Open the Circle’), the looped musique-concrète of ‘Wind-licked Flames’, the monolithic engine aesthetic of ‘The System’, the glacial ambient crackling of ‘Mind Inflamed’ and the minimalist poppings and cracker detonations of torment. His sheer range exemplifies the utter craftsmanship with which he has put this together – moreover there’s a natural intelligence at work here that some would consider to be bordering on supernatural intuition, every element falls easily into its allotted place and every sound is well-chosen for its ability to summon forth the correct atmosphere and ambience.\nAbove all what you come away with from this is deep and unutterable isolation, an existence where pain, sorrow and paranoia are everyday companions – there is no light here, in fact there never has been light and there never will be either. This is a vision of the deepest and most unpleasant level of Hell, where the greatest punishment is not consignment to the flames but sentenced to an eternity of abject and cold loneliness; and not just physical loneliness but complete spiritual separation and isolation, a dark place where one’s soul could wander for all time and still not meet another. This is the greatest fear of the living that we will live and die without the essential contact of others like us; how much more keenly is it felt by those restless ghosts whose earthly bodies have left the source of warmth and solace. Furthermore, if there is any promise that’s been made here, it is that this is the destination for us all, saint and sinner alike, and that no matter how much praying and gnashing of teeth is performed, nothing’s going to change, so get used to it. Freezingly cold and deeply pessimistic and more to the point uncompromisingly so, just like the man said.... and that’s exactly how I like it.\" (Heathen Harvest)\n\"Why do listen to something else when PBK exists??? Impossible to render all atmosphere within and thoughts coming during the process. PBK deals with ambient noise and industrial concreteness covered under entirely unbearing sonic outbursts. Nearly to 70 minutes around music are testing the possibility of human limits. All 13 things are supported by electronic and exclusively instrumental. Free your mind and let the noise manipulate it. As strong as can't be imagined, so take care...\" (Calmant)",

            "about": "This material was released on two cassettes: \"Shamanistic\" (1989) and \" Forming Mankind In My Own Image\" (1990).\n\"Side one: 'Radiate Out' is one of the finest aural collages I've heard in quite some time. The piece has been repeatedly test-driven by your erstwhile reviewer through Industrial Wasteland National Park (Rt. 1/9 thru Jersey City) and has done so much as to make the trip and aesthetic one. The piece changes course about every three minutes either by gradual loop shifting or more abrupt bridging, presenting texture after texture in much the same way as an art gallery leads you past work after work. I'd be interested to know the collaborative strategy behind it. Side two is solo PBK's 'Metachroma(tism)' - reminiscent of the prelude to the afternoon of a nuclear test site. In either case, don't fall asleep with the headphones on.\" (Ear Magazine of New Music)",

            "about": "Chain Letter Exhortation Series, #1\nThe Chain Letter Exhortation Series explores the idea of creating an audio composition and passing it from one participant to another while adding to, modifying and remixing the structure. Unlike the \"Exquisite Corpse\", where each artist places their contribution where the last artist's works ends, in the \"chain\" each artist listens to and decides how to integrate with or subvert the entire structure at their whim. There are no set rules. The process is dictated by each participant, there could be close collaboration between participants, discussions of direction and methodology, or there might be none of that. The personality stamp of the individual may be strong, or might be closer to anonymity.\nThe \"chain letter\" concept began in the late 50's via the mail-art movement. One of its most ardent devotees was Detroit-born, Ray Johnson.\n\"The enigmatic Neo-Dada collagist... Johnson’s stock-in-trade was benevolent chain letters asking recipients if they would kindly add something to what was already enclosed and pass the updated artwork (often an irreverent collage) along to someone new. He didn’t care about getting the letters back so much as giving them long and eventful lives, with many idiosyncratic transformations along the way.\" (Smithsonian, 2018)\n\"By concentrating on mail art, with its invitation to alter the work by whomever receives it, he refused to create a body of work that exhibited a narrative arc of his own 'development.' That productive repudiation carries forward the only motive of the avant-garde that really matters anymore: undoing Western culture’s ever-widening separation of one’s life (living) from one’s art (making).\" (Hyperallergic, 2015)\nLater, the idea was taken up by audio artists working in the cassette underground who would exchange tapes from artist to artist to mix and remix. \"International Mail-Music Group\" with Al Margolis, Bogart, Rafael Flores and Yutaka Tanaka (1986), and \"Chain Mail Collab\" with Das Ubuibi, Jeph Jerman, John Hudak and PBK (1988) both exemplify the four-way collaboration approach used for the Chain Letter Exhortation Series. For purposes of study, the separate mixes are included with the digital download.",

            "about": "Released on a CDR \"PBK / Adam Mokan - Split\", on Cohort Recordings, 2006.\nReviews:\n\"Perhaps Cohort Records found the way to do it. After teaming the well-known Andrew Duke with the lesser known Akumu, here is PBK and Adam Mokan in the same role. But perhaps I am all wrong? Who remembers PBK? Well, I do, from many many years ago. I don't recall reviewing any of his music in the last ten years, say the lifetime of Vital Weekly. In the 80s he was very present and active and released a whole bunch of cassettes and even a 3LP set on the RRRecords label. For whatever reason I may have forgotten by now, or perhaps never knew, he disappeared somewhere in the nineties, but somewhere returned along the lines. On this split release he has four lengthy pieces of what I could call PBK trademark sound. Using found sound, mainly old vinyl, a bunch of analogue synthesizers and sound effects, he creates his music. For me it works best in the very chilly, ambient piece 'Event Lurking Pristine', whereas the other three pieces are more chaotic, densely layered patterns of vinyl skipping and effect hunting. At times perhaps a bit too chaotic for my taste, but good memories return of hissy cassettes, when total mayhem was the way to go. A nice come-back. I have no idea who Adam Mokan is, other than that he has a couple of releases on Russolo (also home of Roxanne Jean Polise) which I never heard. His music is also noise related, but in a more linear fashion, less chaotic. Thickly layered sounds, warped around each other, built from radio waves, analogue synths, sound effects and distortion. Perhaps a bit lo-fi, but it leaves a solid impression on me. Heavy, minimal and yet with enough surprises. Nice one this.\" (Vital Weekly)\n\"If you heard PBK’s music for the first time, probably you wouldn't believe that one of his main influences is John Coltrane (well, Diamanda Galas too). Instead, Adam Mokan lists “sounds, cars crashing, metal scraping, analog drums, feedback, and rock candy” as foundations for his compositions. This odd pairing makes for another nice Cohort CDR, which consists in four tracks by Philip B. Klingler and two by Mokan. The entire spectrum of audio unpredictability is analyzed in PBK’s soundscapes; reminiscent of his past glories in the post-industrial area, but also a highly skilled hypnotizer (don’t forget his collaboration with Vidna Obmana), Klinger juxtaposes the scary and the (sort of) sweet in metaphysical potions where one feels like continuously spinning with a hole in the center of the body, flesh constantly ripped by a needle. If this reminds you of vinyl, you guessed it right: PBK’s tracks often have a “locked groove” quality that renders them acceptable even in their most obscure, apparently unconceivable sections. Thus, the four exhalations contained here will paradoxically appeal both to dark ambient and turntablism fans; but the man is truly in a class of his own. Adam Mokan prefers to work with simpler elements, mostly based upon interdependent connections of distortions and pretty harsh frequencies which at first sound rather sparse but, after a while, start creating a flow which the mind and the body have no trouble camouflaging in. Just think that - amidst all this noise - I managed to get into a half-sleep state during one of my first listenings and that should tell you a lot about the effective harmonic richness of Mokan’s work. Both artists deserve my kudos for this mind-altering collection, which comes totally recommended.\" (Touching Extremes)\n\"Philip B Klinger may not be a household name to many of you. Which wouldn’t surprise me in the least. This American artist has been recording under the name of PBK for the best part of 20+ years off and on. More off as of late but that’s your typical artist for you. His music, and the reason you probably won’t be familiar with him, places him at the fringes of the experimental jet set. That little area where few dare to venture for fear of what they may hear. The dark recesses of the unknown driving many a listener into the arms of a safer more comfortable channel of music. Those of you however who are acquainted with PBK should meet up with me some day. Maybe we can share a drink together and reminisce about the good old days. Tell our stories about how PBK deserves better and wider recognition and how ‘such and such’ a release by him changed our lives. Shoot the breeze and all that. If successful, and we liked each other, we could even make it an annual event. That would be fun. Almost as much fun as this split release between PBK and Adam Mokan in fact. And you wouldn’t have to put up with my incessant droning on about quality music like this and why on earth it isn’t more popular. The little information paragraph kept incredibly short this time around. Cohort Records is run by John Gore of Kirchenkampf fame. Amongst others. This split release is limited to 100 copies. The cover is &ldots;well&ldots;functional but dull as covers go. A kind of bronze / gold coloured mottled single sleeve affair that looks like the wallpaper found in a crap Chinese restaurant circa 1970. But you don’t buy music just for the cover. Which in this case is a blessing. You can buy this for $9.00 direct from the label. Have your credit card on standby at the end of this review. The first four tracks belong to our man PBK. The guy who puts the E into experimental. Taking the ‘music can be created by anything at hand’ approach he uses old analogue synths, found sounds and effects, old batches of vinyl and a multitude of other unknown variants to help mould these four pieces into aural sculptures of a frightening intensity. There’s something strangely comforting when you listen to hiss and crackles over machine like chaos and disharmony. The buzzing and glowing mixing it with glitches and globules and the Industrial hum and throbs and dense frequencies that permeate throughout. At times there’s a rhythmic pattern cutting loose before being quickly restrained amongst all the mucky murky debris being thrown around without a care in the world. The frozen wastelands of black ambience even makes a fleeting appearance now and then before being swallowed up by an electronic melange. Think of these tracks as sound sculptures for the more enlightened and adventurous listener and you’ll be half way there to understanding the music PBK has laid down. Not an easy going or getting into experience but one that rewards those with an open mind and an ear to the left of base form of music. 35+ minutes in the company of PBK is worth every second of the experience. His mucker in arms Adam Mokan is a new artist that I’ve never encountered before. His two contributions are 26+ minutes of music that veers more towards the noisier spectrum with a smattering of pizzazz to complete the picture. Through the dense fog of simply formed thick electronic sounds, very bass heavy in places, he mixes in high frequency assaults, ample distorted waves and some eclectic effects that are suitably placed within both soundscapes. His music is more minimal in scope and production and therefore more accessible overall&ldots;.but still falls way short of an easy listening experience. Definitely a name to watch out for in the future. The summary. For those of you reading this into the more experimental side of music, who wear their ‘I’m into stuff you’ve never heard of before’ badges with pride on your jacket lapels, then this release will make a great addition to your record collection. Everyone else can just fuck off. This isn’t for you. Simple as that. Because no matter how many words I write I doubt that if you aren’t into this form of music before the review started then this review will not have changed your minds one little bit. So blinkered and stupid the majority are. The few of us who understand where artists like PBK and Adam Mokan are coming from and going to are in the minority. But I would rather be with them than you any day of the week.\" (Heathen Harvest)\n\"Sometimes the best things in life can be found nestled in the edges; you know, peeking out of the corners, stealing glances from under the covers. Monticello, Indiana, isn’t exactly the nexus for experimental music in the US by any stretch, but it is in fact the place Cohort Records owner John Gore calls home, and like it or not, what he issues from his diminuitive CDR label are the kind of aural objects you obtain fast and clutch tightly to chest, lest they vanish into the ether. Trucking in names either reasonably obscure or desperately unknown, the discrete charm of Gore’s imprint means those wanting to seek out the less obvious purveyors of all things weird, whacked and wonderful can shell out very little and usually receive very much. PBK and Mokan’s release is an altogether different kettle of (blow)fish. Like that spiny creature, Philip B. Klinger might be the penultimate experimentalist “pariah”—he’s been dutifully pursuing his own singleminded course for the better part of 20 years, a fixture on the US 80s cassette underground and a legend of sorts in the agitprop/noise community. Far more intellectually rigorous than colleagues such as Merzbow, KK Null, or Aube, PBK ushered in the era of the glitch years before annotators ever coined it a term. Previous collaborations on both ends of the sonic spectrum (Asmus Tietchens, Artemiy Artemiev) have painted him as a very idiosyncratic sound sculptor who remains a distinctive presence on the “scene,” one whose anonymity is a puzzling phenomenon indeed—those prior teamings alone should have raised his profile amongst the literati. I’ve found some of his earlier, tentative work to be a bit too disassociative at times, his amelodic/aharmonic gesticulations erupting out of the speaker fabric ass-over-teakettle, scattering about with little obvious reason or \"sense\"—avantism for avantism's sake. Be this as it may, the four tracks included here are of a singular offering, clearly some of his best work since the aforementioned Artemiev pairing. Not that it was in any way necessary, but opening track “Through the Past Away” indicates PBK’s discovering a newly-found melodic linearity within his machines: the grinding oscillations and steam-engine coarsities remain his trademark, though rendered here with a particularly cohesive, and supple, flair. “Build Your Own Nothing” spits, clicks, shushes, shudders, and shivers in a manner that Oval probably never considered, while “The Channel that Feeds” situates the listener in a deserted governmental think tank doubling as haunted house, full of abrupt clangings, strange vibes, parched airbursts and what might be the very walls cracking. When the finality of “Event Lurking Pristine,” a cathartic passel of stretched-taut metallic drones finishes, you’re left in shock, fairly breathless. It’s simply a crime that Klinger doesn’t get the recognition he so richly deserves—help, help him, Rhonda! Conversely, newcomer Mokan is more of a strict “noiseician,” a Merzbow wanna-be, if you would. His two lengthy tracks eviscerate the guts from corroded engines, battered synthesizers, burned-out amps. I’d like to believe that “Winding Rhode” is constructed by beating the shit out of an old Fender, then sampling the detritus out of phase and flanging what’s left to death; it’s actually an 11-minute excursion into dirty, disused drone that does in fact sound like a Rhodes being manhandled, but Makon doesn’t extract much from his sound source other than onanistic distortion. Which, as PBK can tell you, isn’t the whole enchilada.\" (ei)",

            "about": "Live improvisations recorded at the PBK studio in 1989/90.\nDirk Serries (Vidna Obmana) traveled from Belgium to the U.S. in 1989 and '90. Both times he stayed with Phillip B. Klingler (PBK) and worked in Klingler's recording studio in San Bernardino, California. In between working on source material for Serries' solo albums, the two found time to collaborate. The music contained on this album was recorded live in the studio with both artists improvising in real-time. The tracks were recorded directly to cassette and some contain significant technical flaws, tape saturation overload and hiss, clicks/pops, etc. Because of these flaws this audio remained unreleased until now. When Serries and Klingler revisited these recordings in 2016, they decided the material should be released after all, even with the perceptible imperfections. The sound is distinctly different from each artist's solo work of that time, with dramatic tension and release, vivid filmic aspects, dynamic crescendos, sepulchral voices whispering... all making these spontaneous creations unique in each artist's discography.",

            "about": "Released on compact disc via ND Recordings, 1992.\nReviews:\n\"What I've always liked about PBK's work is his sense of spectral distribution in his compositions. While many noise artists tend to bungle about leaving out big chunks of the audio spectrum and still other noisicians have no regard for this spectral quality and simply fill up every imaginable frequency with sheer volume supplying you with eternal white or pink noise, PBK has a sensitivity that elevates his work to a different class. PBK's recordings are passages in time, where frequency components travel from instant to instant, intermarry and spontaneously reproduce new composites of themselves. Never is there a neglected frequency, yet the sounds are always fundamental enough to be discreet elements of composition. His recordings consist of brief source noises which are processed and layered repeatedly, unfolding and evolving before you. His work has correctly been compared to Asmus Tietchens, and indeed the two were briefly married on the '91 release, 'Five Manifestoes'. This cd is actually two works, and they continue in the direction described above. 'Macrophage\" is the harder of the two, while 'The Toil And The Reap\" is much more pastoral. My favorite piece on 'Macrophage' is 'Onset', where he uses a synth to create an atmospheric reference and has all kinds of noises gathering and crashing gently, in a way that is reminiscent of Sema's harsher work. The following piece, 'Aftermath', continues this trend, but the noise sources dominate as if they have won some kind of private war. 'The Toil And The Reap\" is a very romantic and surreal work, bearing titles such as 'Eyelids Closed, As In A Dream', 'Beckoning', and 'Poison Sweets Of Love'. Vidna Obmana, a long-time friend of PBK and former collaborator, makes a guest appearance on 'Beckoning'. While 'Toil' indicates a continuing development in the manipulation of noise, there is also a trend toward the use of traditional instrumentation as well. This work is a green and fertile landscape turned eerie gray and silver by the most beautiful storm clouds imaginable. I think the wind is picking up.\" (Audio Drudge)\n\"This first CD by PBK (excluding the CD with Asmus Tietchens) divides into two sections, but there isn't substantial disparity between them. 'Macrophage' has in the foreground more dark noises, extreme loops, metal clangours, destructive dins... In this first part there isn't a real development of the compositions, all the songs are complete in their compactness, they are power atoms, perfect in their circularity. Whereas in 'The Toil And The Reap\" there is the working out of the sonorities in the various tracks; there are also sampled sounds near the noise, the echoes of millenary crashes of meteorites, the infinite running after each other of destruction's moments... but all is in motion. A way flows from a sound, and it develops in all the tracks, with a perfect continuity. In 'Eyelids Closed, As In A Dream' it's being oneiric allows to travel towards unknown dimensions; In 'Beckoning', Vidna Obmana's participation makes still stronger the enchanted call towards the unknown.\" (Batty's Tears)\n\"Macrophage combines stormy walls of sound with muffled rhythms; sounding at one point like a mechanized torture chamber filled with horses trotting around, but The Toil and the Reap is more conventional, mixing dangerous ambience with insistent electronics.\" (EST)\n\"Dense, ambient noise wash compositions that gush into white noise territory on currents of searing Learjet backblast and automated cinderblock factory malfunction. Falling asleep to this is challenging, though the Toil portion, from an older recording session, seeps into spacier territory--particularly \"Beckoning\", a collaboration with Belgian electronic composer Vidna Obmana. Ominous and complex music, packaged in a beautifully designed cardstock sleeve with raised, embossed design on the front cover.\" (Reign Of Toads)",

            "about": "\"This Home Stands On Ancient Bones\" from 2023 — a dark ambient journey in collaboration with Nigel Ayers (Nocturnal Emissions) and Allan Zane (Wyrm). This release emerged as a beautifully sustained work of drifting textures, cryptic vocal fragments, and high-vibrational atmospheres. Nigel’s voice appears like a transmission from a dream, submerged and spectral.\nReleased as a compact disc on VLZ Produkt (Japan), 2023.",
            "credits": "released May 2, 2025\nAll sounds by Nigel Ayers, Phillip B. Klingler and Allan Zane. Recorded in 2023. Graphics/layout by Allan Zane and Akira Matsuoka.",

            "about": "Released on CD in 2009 by Waystyx, Russia.\nReviews:\n\"PBK reveals dark inner leanings of his shrouded mind with Under My Breath, a full-length CD of extremely varied noises – rattlings, phased drones, heavy throbs and gas jets, layers, distorted voices, digital delay, angelic choirs and mangled synthesizers. Not a single track passes by without conveying certain grisly and creepy sensations of imminent death or disaster, while the lyrical track titles allude to bones, skin, meat, children, fire, air and all the matter in the cosmos refracted through this grim prophet's all-seeing eye. His mystic messages are so secret they are printed backwards on the inside of the front cover but can be read by positioning the silver CD so it acts as a mirror. Cover is also die-cut with small rectangular holes, allowing us to peer into PBK's fevered brain as if through the bars of a prison or a sewer grating. 'I lived beyond extinction so far', he claims, and who dare gainsay that outlandish boast!\" (The Sound Projector)\n\"PBK... is attached to the old and the new, the younger generation of sound artists. Pieces on 'Under My Breath' were recorded with people like Akifumi Nakajima (Aube), Christian Renou (Brume), Dale Lloyd, John Wiggins, Nigel Ayers, Slavek Kwi (Artificial Memory Trace), Tore Boe and Wolf Eyes. PBK uses 'natural or man-made acoustic sounds, digital glitching and turntable noise', but it's his goal to create music that is 'organic' and not (too) noise based. He blends his various source recordings together and makes up a sound that falls half way in the old ambient industrial school and the other half shows an interest in using computer processing for his sounds. ...Throughout the material is quite strong. PBK successfully updates his own 'old' style and makes something new out of it.\" (Vital Weekly)",

Nothing quite like this has happened my way since the early work of Graham Lewis and B.C. Gilbert. In case anyone takes that to mean fans of contemporary Wire will like this tape, think again; this is very unfriendly, completely unpleasant noise. This is also an excellent tape, but most of you will probably hate it.\" (Lowlife)",

            "about": "Chain Letter Exhortation Series, #5\nThe Chain Letter Exhortation Series explores the idea of creating an audio composition and passing it from one participant to another while adding to, modifying and remixing the structure. Unlike the \"Exquisite Corpse\", where each artist places their contribution where the last artist's works ends, in the \"chain\" each artist listens to and decides how to integrate with or subvert the entire structure at their whim. There are no set rules. The process is dictated by each participant, there could be close collaboration between participants, discussions of direction and methodology, or there might be none of that. The personality stamp of the individual may be strong, or might be closer to anonymity.\nThe \"chain letter\" concept began in the late 50's via the mail-art movement. One of its most ardent devotees was Detroit-born, Ray Johnson.\n\"The enigmatic Neo-Dada collagist... Johnson’s stock-in-trade was benevolent chain letters asking recipients if they would kindly add something to what was already enclosed and pass the updated artwork (often an irreverent collage) along to someone new. He didn’t care about getting the letters back so much as giving them long and eventful lives, with many idiosyncratic transformations along the way.\" (Smithsonian, 2018)\n\"By concentrating on mail art, with its invitation to alter the work by whomever receives it, he refused to create a body of work that exhibited a narrative arc of his own 'development.' That productive repudiation carries forward the only motive of the avant-garde that really matters anymore: undoing Western culture’s ever-widening separation of one’s life (living) from one’s art (making).\" (Hyperallergic, 2015)\nLater, the idea was taken up by audio artists working in the cassette underground who would exchange tapes from artist to artist to mix and remix. \"International Mail-Music Group\" with Al Margolis, Bogart, Rafael Flores and Yutaka Tanaka (1986), and \"Chain Mail Collab\" with Das Ubuibi, Jeph Jerman, John Hudak and PBK (1988) both exemplify the four-way collaboration approach used for the Chain Letter Exhortation Series. For purposes of study, the separate mixes are included with the digital download.",

            "about": "From 2021-22, Phillip B. Klingler (PBK) and Guido Hübner (Das Synthetische Mischgewebe, DSM) began to conceptualize a split-release on cassette tape with the title, \"ZIZ\". With each side acting as a mirror of the other, PBK and DSM would meditate and reflect on each other's audio creations. The parallelism extends beyond the music itself, both sides bear the same title, \"Zeh,\" blurring the boundaries between the artists' distinct approaches. The dialogue between the artists, as reflected on \"ZIZ\", reveals not only the power of this interaction but also the potential that lies within the intersections of such diverse inspirations. \"ZIZ\" is a co-release on PBKsound (USA) and Racourcie d'atom (EU).\n\"As Leviathan is the king of fishes, so the Ziz is appointed to rule over the birds. His name comes from the variety of tastes his flesh has; it tastes like this, zeh, and like that, zeh. The Ziz is as monstrous of size as Leviathan himself. His ankles rest on the earth, and his head reaches to the very sky... The Ziz has another name, Renanin, because he is the celestial singer. On account of his relation to the heavenly regions, he is also called Sekwi, the seer...\"\n\"It is Ziz, the heavenly bird, created by medieval exegesis and featured among the dishes of the feast of the righteous. It is not present in the Bible or inter-testamentary literature but is often mentioned in rabbinical sources. His name is linked to his food destination by the creative etymology of the rabbis: Why was he called Ziz? Because it has different tastes: the taste of this (zeh) and the taste of that (zeh). (Lv. R 22.10).\"",
