Perfection in those blackened teeth That sultry purr of yours, so turbulent yet sweet as clementine That holy softness kept within your downy coat, for me to find That thing your ears do, when I say you’re my best friend We should do this again! We should do this again! We should do this again! We should do this again! So it goes, we talk with the mouths we made by paw We throw things we built in the interim last fall I’m her entangled pet, offhandedly beloved May we follow forward blindly? Nay, Heimdall ignores our crawl So it goes, she steps towards me gently in the dark Dim tomes, still left o’er these bends, beneath the mark My lover feels soft as ever, even as our fiction hitherto Lies open, Christ, it breathes unbroken, my dear kitten, I know you Your eyes of amethyst adrift amidst the birth of night That hint of sanguine as the moonlight hits your fur just right That silver snaggletooth I catch reflecting windows back at me That claw of peppermint, thy clasp! Perfection in those blackened teeth That sultry purr of yours, so turbulent yet sweet as clementine That holy softness kept within your downy coat, for me to find That thing your ears do, when I say you’re my best friend We should do this again! We should do this again! We should do this again! We should do this again!",

I’m asking clearly What say you to this? Look in the mist, O, you can see me in my prime But there is no shame in looking, you don’t have to hide Put down the glass between us, look me in my eyes There is no shame in looking, you don’t have to hide Our use can rasterize the fall The future hankers for us all Lemme set the scene, real quick You had her on a leash, a crass depiction, robbed her of a name So becoming, she was slathered like a lozenge with your paint For what it’s worth my liege, I’ll have you know your father was the same So curmudgeonly, he lasted ‘till he saw her in a frame You carry the pleasure within your jaw, I can see you swallow There, your throat belies Look in the mist, O, you can see me in my prime But there is no shame in looking, you don’t have to hide Put down the glass between us, look me in my eyes There is no shame in looking, you don’t have to hide",

I shot my wife in Overijssel I buried her in Germany I shot her with my fancy rifle She didn’t even look at me I shot my wife in Overijssel I buried her in Germany I shot her with my fancy rifle She didn’t even look at me She was a caliper, a malady, rectangular Refurbished in the name of cut-rate incense, Satya Lavender She stunk with insincerity, essential oils her verity Disloyalty, conformity, and riches were the air she breathes She said I had no heart, as if she hadn’t taken it I saw her heart adrift, I’ll use her pearly rib to stake it in She said that I was sick, as if she had to tell me that I’ll pawn her teeth abroad, “Alkmaar, Leiden, Utrecht, and Lelystad”  Pop, look alive, look at ease Look ahead, check, don’t avert your eyes, don’t appease She’s nowhere to be found no more, she’s with her father now No cell can come between my dearest wife and her new crimson gown Six hundred long kilometers from Zwolle to the border Law and order comes ‘a knocking, but I won’t be waiting for her Sitting tight, with my wife waiting quiet like a gem How’d I end up here again? I shot my wife in Overijssel I buried her in Germany I shot her with my fancy rifle She didn’t even look at me I shot my wife in Overijssel I buried her in Germany I shot her with my fancy rifle She didn’t even look at me",

Can you sing along? I don’t hold you to the best, but Can’t you see the lines and dots? Don’t you feel as if you’re missing something?  Do you understand? You think you know the mistress, well You see me as I am, but... I’m a skeptic of the senses, I don’t think you’ve broke The terror found in relishing pretention, I don’t think you’ve spoke To any of your characters, purveyors of your barriers The scariest it gets is far behind the world you know, so... Can you sing along?  She was looking like a summer Can’t you see the lines and dots? And in turn, beget the sun within her Do you understand? You think you know the mistress, well You see me as I am, but... Can you see me with the lights off? The quale I brought to class? Articulate the beauty of a flower held behind my back Face down, ass up, represented in the black auditorium  We’re telling stories of a blasphemous aurator  Is the fur still succulent and downy in the mind Face down, tail up, feel it jostle in your hand It’s the beauty of a flower held behind my back  I’m that doggie in the window of your church Every Sunday, you could see me if your muzzle formed the words Think absurdly in the evening, think concretely by the dawn Think along the lines you recognize, but never dared to walk Can you sing along? I don’t hold you to the best, but Can’t you see the lines and dots? Don’t you feel as if you’re missing something?  Do you understand? You think you know the mistress, well You see me as I am, but... Can you sense the gold within a Friendship saved? Can you lens the lurid lines belied inside On A Clear Day?  Can you grab the squalid square laid bare amongst a Desert Rain? Can you nab the stained stripes entwined a meek Untitled 8? I say! Can you sing along?  She was looking like a summer Can’t you see the lines and dots? And in turn, beget the sun within her Do you understand? You think you know the mistress, well You see me as I am, but... Can you see me with the lights off? The quale I brought to class? Articulate the beauty of a flower held behind my back Face down, ass up, represented in the black auditorium  We’re telling stories of a blasphemous aurator  Is the fur still succulent and downy in the mind Face down, tail up, feel it jostle in your hand It’s the beauty of a flower held behind my back",

But it sounds kinda weird when I say I like you, too I’m not supposed to say I need you But it sounds kinda weird when I say I want you, too Somehow, you cost me So little energy, you... Just don’t expect the same things of me as I’m told by my behavioral aids  But in speech therapy they... They seem so proud of me, they... Gave me three comic books and sweets from my incentive yesterday! We lie together every afternoon I talk a lot more now, a lot about myself, but you know you can do that too Adrift at sea, we rest upon each other’s coats I feel a lot of things, but for this I feel the most I’m not supposed to say I love you... But it sounds kinda weird when I say I like you, too I’m not supposed to say I need you But it sounds kinda weird when I say I want you, too",

I see her in your eyes, that poem in your throat Do you feel like you’re dreaming? Do you feel as if you’ll fall? Do mountains lose their meaning when they seem this small? Can you keep me a secret? Don’t answer that, I know Out here your vessel lies transparent to your soul This freeway runs so high Its end meets eye to eye Point a claw at the terminus And watch the stars sail by The cars flow back and forth A light path to the north Red and white leviathan  Her scales a glistening shore The big wheel in the sky He arcs o’er miles and miles It’s getting hard to breathe So take my paw and dive We can see the whole town from up here Feel the wind sail past our ears The whistling noise it makes So frigid and so fierce Hold onto yourself now Don’t let your body go It slips so easily through starlight’s undertow Hold close to the wind now Those shivers in your spine They bind like wires to the world that waits outside Do you feel like you’re changing? Your body knows its shape That timbre rings across your skin, around your nape Can you hear the birdsong? Can you smell the distant rain? Look inside yourself, you’ll see you’re still the same This freeway runs so high Its end meets eye to eye Point a claw at the terminus And watch the stars sail by The cars flow back and forth A light path to the north Red and white leviathan  Her scales a glistening shore The big wheel in the sky He arcs o’er miles and miles It’s getting hard to breathe So take my paw and dive We can see the whole town from up here Feel the wind sail past our ears The whistling noise it makes So frigid and so fierce Can I ask you a question? I promise I’ll be brief I have a feeling you have somewhere else to be Does it feel a bit hazy? Will you be waking soon?  Will you remember me, when you’re back in your room? This freeway runs so high Its end meets eye to eye Point a claw at the terminus And watch the stars sail by The cars flow back and forth A light path to the north Red and white leviathan  Her scales a glistening shore The big wheel in the sky He arcs o’er miles and miles It’s getting hard to breathe So take my paw and dive We can see the whole town from up here Feel the wind sail past our ears The whistling noise it makes So frigid and so fierce",

You idiot. \r Restricting the fair use of clips is insidious. \r The ones you inspire don’t owe you shit\r It’s your duty to put your art out and evolve it\r The right to copy is essential to fairness\r Great art was made when your grandparents shared it\r Think of when Dianna said “It’s all in your head”\r How the fifth wave of punk was debatebly bred\r It wasn’t her choice to slow it down and release it\r For almost no money, yet she still can impeach it.\r And you, dear Dale, really shouldn’t care\r When an artist gets big in ways you deemed unfair\r Maybe recontextualizing the past isn’t hard enough\r Because obviously music is judged by how tough it is\r See where it all comes from\r No musician wears no influences on their collar bone.\r Yet Mozart couldn’t foresee Lil Yachty\r Art isn’t a palm tree, it’s beautiful and sprawling.\r The only excuse for the survival of humanity\r Inspiration flows chaotically and rabidly\r In no case would one put a tax on the air\r Yet we put needless price tags on the everyman’s prayer\r On doors to other worlds, on portals to views\r New ways to feel, even if it’s obtuse\r Think deeply, about what you wish to do\r When you keep piracy and supposed plagiarism subdued\r What you really want now is for art to slow down\r Just consider for a few minutes, let art bring itself to better places.",

There’s nothing I can take\r Police are roving in my veins, a venom coursing, yearning hatred\r It’s second nature now to think myself a traitor\r To myself, to all I’ve ever burdened with my rotting visage\r I can’t breathe, the weight of all I’ve disappointed crushes me\r If I were happy it would feel as if I couldn’t trust me\r Don’t care. You could be smiling if you wanted to\r You could be driving, could be flying if you wanted to\r You hear that noise? You hear that screaming? That’s your voice\r Trapped inside, you could take it out to cry if you wanted to\r Why fight? I’d like to think I’m on my side\r But nothing that I’ve thought today has let me think I’m right\r You hear that sound? Or is your coursing blood too loud?\r Will your better sense come out or will you be alone tonight\r Don’t microwave your milk too long, it browns and bubbles over\r Don’t let anyone see into you, don’t let them see your need\r I burned a forest down for this, I must have something to show for it\r But alas, the stars don’t feel like smiling upon me\r It’s second nature now to think myself a traitor\r To myself, to all I’ve ever burdened with my rotting visage\r I can’t breathe, the weight of all I’ve disappointed crushes me\r If I were happy it would feel as if I couldn’t trust me\r Don’t care. You could be smiling if you wanted to\r You could be driving, could be flying if you wanted to\r You hear that noise? You hear that screaming? That’s your voice\r Trapped inside, you could take it out to cry if you wanted to   \r Why fight? I’d like to think I’m on my side\r But nothing that I’ve thought today has let me think I’m right\r You hear that sound? Or is your coursing blood too loud?\r Will your better sense come out or will you stay alone tonight\r There’s a pin-light shining out in the mountains\r Can’t you see?\r It flutters in and out of vision\r In a hue I can’t quite place\r There’s a humming in the air here\r Listen close\r It’s like a warmth spreading through me\r Through the canyons of my mind\r The flowers seem so vivid way out there\r Beyond regret\r I see a gradient from greyscale\r Leading into rainbow’s end\r The land of milk and honey is in reach\r It seems so close\r I only need to touch the grass\r And I’ll be one of them\r Oh God I swear, don’t fail me now\r The light is here\r I can’t forget what it feels like\r Just to act as I belong\r Goddamnit I can’t take this anymore\r I’m stepping out\r I only hope that the sunlight hasn’t \r left while I was gone\r Oh God I swear, don’t let me down\r You’re all I have\r I can’t forget what it feels like\r To be loved and taken in\r I used to love the scent of rainfall in the dawn\r The touch of sun\r I only hope there’s something left here\r Something left for me to hold",

(doin' great bitch)\r It’s a world of loud wishes, but even louder fears (what does that mean?)\r All my life, it hasn’t gotten under my skin (what's up!)\r But just this time, I’d say it’s looking pretty grim.",

She still can hear him say,\r Brandy, you're a fine girl, what a good wife you would be, my life, my love, and my lady is the sea.",

There’s no way to test \r If I can fit in with these men \r In due time \r We made a bond that can’t be broke \r But part of me still worries about the things he doesn’t know, I say \r How will he ever know, how far I wish to go \r I’m breaking from head to toe \r He plays guitar in a thrash band, I can’t say that’s my genre \r Distortion in the high end, I can’t say that’s my timbre \r I might sound immature, but I’m just as sure \r I can’t say I don’t like him \r I can’t say I don’t like him \r Every time I’m with him is a treat \r It's like my mind is free \r I can’t say I don’t like him \r I can’t say I don’t like him \r We’ll just wait and see, we’ll just wait and see \r If he likes me.",

Call me crazy, call me slow\r Got my own cilantro mixture, watch me rolling watch me go\r Special! Call your doctor and your priest\r Got my own malignant scripture and it works phenomenally\r Who made the moon that pulchritudinous silver?\r She must have bought that shade from a market in Peru\r Can’t help but look upon her gorgeous trinkets\r I always wish that I could have that attitude\r What’s that sound? Slam! The door’s gone down\r Like a billowing storm drain swallowing rounds\r There’s not a soul here, telegraphed fear, delicate tears\r Glitter-ific on the unwashed spears\r I ask, which girl is that? \r She’s brash, like a devil of the wild outback\r She’s fast, like a bottle of a held attack\r She got cash, pull ‘em up on the forty first track\r Special! Call me crazy, call me slow\r Got my own cilantro mixture, watch me rolling watch me go\r Special! Call your doctor and your priest\r Got my own malignant scripture and it works phenomenally",

I can’t sleep\r A bridge, inside of my heart, the wooden supports are rebuilt\r Hark, there’s a noise in the dark, something sleek\r May I stop pretending that I’m not obsessed \r Can I say I deserve to be happy again\r Say what you see, because nothing feels real\r Do you feel the same way as me?\r He sings, jubilant under the trees, the wind holds his song just for me\r Say, will he see me today? I can’t sleep\r He waits, patiently primed with a smile, something I cannot explain\r Hark, we will meet in the dark, we’ll be free\r May I stop pretending that I’m not obsessed \r Can I say I deserve to be happy again\r Say what you see, because nothing feels real\r Do you feel the same way as me?",

You say I’ll\t  be happier if I give you what you seek But what’s in it for me, what’s in it for me? Well... it’s been years now, I’m doing fine, thanks for asking I still live on, persist beyond my short allotted time with you I’ve seen infinity, it’s longer than you think And now I’m walking back right through it just to see if I can find anything new So far I’m penniless, found nothing in that sea I drowned in Even the sand below won’t show me any trace of those old spires Oh I tried, I can’t deny, it was a venture and a half And now I’m sopping wet, I’m dropping dead, I’m angry and I’m tired Then again, the time I spent was no regret for me To know, reaffirm that there was nothing left to find No self within to speak of, no crying voice to follow There must have been a day I went and left myself behind He drifted long ago to somewhere I can’t reach Dissolved and deliquesced, he slept in starlight, never again to rise I hold no piece of him no more, he took it all away I only wish I had the chance to say goodbye. (OH AIN’T THAT SUMMIN? DRUMS CAME IN YOU AIN’T SEE THAT COMMIN) What am I now? Good question, I haven’t any clue I’m something, that’s for sure, I think, therefore I am, I think? The sea I know is full of terrible leviathans, but... I’ve got the rest of time to make some land The sea was good to me, I wish her all the best Our time was wonderful, but over, all precious things can’t last I’m a cartographer, I’ll take a piece of paper and... Bark as loud as I can You said I’d be happier if I lay and let you teach But what’s in it for me? What’s in it for me? You said I’d be happier if I gave you what you seek But what’s in it for me... Honey, I’m smiling big On a road right now that I can’t predict Tell me “Tone that down” but I can’t resist Y’all know that sound, better raise your fist  (belt’s back yeh) Set up camp at the end ‘a time Rewrite the story line by line It’s arduous, but I think you might agree... There's no better a time to see No better a time to see No better a time to see No better a time to see What's in it for me",

You say I’ll\t  be happier if I give you what you seek But what’s in it for me, what’s in it for me? Well... it’s been years now, I’m doing fine, thanks for asking I still live on, persist beyond my short allotted time with you I’ve seen infinity, it’s longer than you think And now I’m walking back right through it just to see if I can find anything new So far I’m penniless, found nothing in that sea I drowned in Even the sand below won’t show me any trace of those old spires Oh I tried, I can’t deny, it was a venture and a half And now I’m sopping wet, I’m dropping dead, I’m angry and I’m tired Then again, the time I spent was no regret for me To know, reaffirm that there was nothing left to find No self within to speak of, no crying voice to follow There must have been a day I went and left myself behind He drifted long ago to somewhere I can’t reach Dissolved and deliquesced, he slept in starlight, never again to rise I hold no piece of him no more, he took it all away I only wish I had the chance to say goodbye. (OH AIN’T THAT SUMMIN? DRUMS CAME IN YOU AIN’T SEE THAT COMMIN) What am I now? Good question, I haven’t any clue I’m something, that’s for sure, I think, therefore I am, I think? The sea I know is full of terrible leviathans, but... I’ve got the rest of time to make some land The sea was good to me, I wish her all the best Our time was wonderful, but over, all precious things can’t last I’m a cartographer, I’ll take a piece of paper and... Bark as loud as I can You said I’d be happier if I lay and let you teach But what’s in it for me? What’s in it for me? You said I’d be happier if I gave you what you seek But what’s in it for me... Honey, I’m smiling big On a road right now that I can’t predict Tell me “Tone that down” but I can’t resist Y’all know that sound, better raise your fist  (belt’s back yeh) Set up camp at the end ‘a time Rewrite the story line by line It’s arduous, but I think you might agree... There's no better a time to see No better a time to see No better a time to see No better a time to see What's in it for me",

It doesn’t feel any different. \r Look at me! That’s all this is, look at me!\r Music’s a call for attention, that’s why I give it out for free.\r Just hoping someone will give a damn to my tragedies\r I’m squirting my shit all over the internet’s special branches of the tree\r So what is it? If that was all I’m looking for,\r Then why can’t I just kill my pride and go four on the floor?\r All I do is cut off those I could connect to if I tried\r But I stay here out of some misguided effort not to lie\r Every artist says their work is for them and them only\r But the best one on the planet wouldn’t make shit for nobody\r And just as high and mighty as I pretend to be\r I know I’m just as starved without an audience who prays to me\r Roadways inside my head\r Did I forget to mention,\r The time we have is running out.\r Roadways inside my head\r Did I forget to mention,\r The time we have is running out.\r My inspiration’s tapped\r But at least I know a guy who likes self-referential rap\r Nine tracks were all I needed, just add another and wrap\r This shit’s gone on for too long, at least this track’s last.\r How can I say that it’s worth it?\r I’ve dropped 19 albums but I still haven’t fucked Brady Corbet.\r Everything that tells me not to Synecdoche New York it\r Is failing like the flailing mind ready to abort it\r ‘Cause if I get the chance I’ll live a trillion goddamn years\r ‘Cause every year I die earlier is nine records you won’t hear\r Does that sound narcissistic? That’s something to expect,\r Because every time I’m not I’m a self loathing wreck.\r But I can’t say that now we have that much hope left\r I wish I’d gotten famous before I saw the fucking world end\r I’m sorry I made you sit through my self-indulgent screed\r Now take a seat right here ask me what the fuck it means. \r Roadways inside my head\r Did I forget to mention,\r The time we have is running out.\r Roadways inside my head\r Did I forget to mention,\r The time we have is running out.\r State!",

J’ai désolé Do you know what I mean? I’ll admit, I can be difficult to understand Is anybody out there? Will anybody harken to me I’ll let anybody sit down, sit down, If you listen carefully Now if I said, “Pull the lace a little tighter, man” Would you take me by the ankles with your spiderhands And if I’m ever out of turn Hold me down and tell me “Darling, not another word” If I said “I could do this for you anyday” Would you vow to keep me docile and dependant on your say And if I ever scream for more Strike my body like your dad’s a fucking minotaur The id’s forgotten how to swim And if I dally, I fear something shall befall him I lie in waiting, with a drink Rose negligee, blue slippers, wine red drawers and jet black cufflinks   The ancient sky is white and bare The light is plentiful, his blouse aflame, his skin fair I hold my right paw in the air I raise a padded thumb and tell the sun to get down from there Je suis pianiste, pas poète.

From the mountains I could see And new feelings came to me I came to him a creature, a beaten brownish rodent at his feet I gave a kiss, grotesquely splayed before his blinding effigy I writhed, in waiting in the dirt, I waited for his word I felt so weak, so disgusting as I wept upon his knees I could sense the old contempt I had assumed this wolf would feel But O, There! Came his paws, the wolf took hold and carried me away The bread breaks, across my back so gently, between the cracks I kneel with a saucerful of milk between my legs I was starving, all my life for something I hadn’t ever known Before I tasted what you served upon your fur You came to me a beast, I came to you a creature I asked you what it means, you promised me a leader I don’t understand it either, I don’t understand it either But when you called me yours, it felt real Oh it felt real",

Oh won’t you tell me what’s on your mind? As in, the images you’ve writ I can’t begin to parse what I’m feeling here But I might join in. Descriptions of our love Descriptions of your body Running through my head I’m running when you call me your girl Terrifying gold The forest where I saw you Daughter of the wolf In seconds I would call you… dad When the wolf tells stories to me, I’m always sure to volunteer my paw He taught me patiently, to hold his old quill, and I caught on Laughter, in the evening, passion at dawn, like writing songs Belief, beyond I can’t ever begin to know, or convey the bliss of our poetry, our words unread The passages a cradle set, the stanzas broad walls, a house we bled Your shimmer stains the desert floor, I follow your breath, Star of Bethlehem I’m a child again. Descriptions of our love Descriptions of your body Running through my head I’m running when you call me your girl Terrifying gold The forest where I saw you Daughter of the wolf In seconds I would call you… dad",

I only say this to an empty room When you came to me, you only came to say you’re leaving soon I can only look upon the blood I shed for us I loved you more than anything, but all I ever said was I’m sorry.",

For music can reach the darkest of lands I come to sing, hear ye! With choirs and busking bands [ TeamGetMoney : He/Him ] It’s hard to breathe You are my air Queen of the throne You are the heir No one can compare Heaven is full know life not fair Circumstances got us dancing With the stars I’m in awe Standing ovation the crowd applaud Still can’t believe what I just saw I was so blinded now it’s clear Take a leap have no fear Conquer your emotions Sip on this potion Let’s be free as the birds in the sky Oh my is this heaven Is this a connection I can see you when I see my reflection You a blessing forget the stressing Let’s get away for a lifetime You see the signs take heed Your exactly what I need On bending knees begging please Slow motion the speed Because we are going too fast Racing to your love hopin I don’t crash Ok now we talking ok let’s get it started You know we poppin You know who going the hardest Dats regardless any hate I disregard it Keep it movin she been choosing on me The floor is yours now speak [ Lola Sebastian ] She took my lung, O’day! For my organs begot the finest of lace She told me then, O’day! The oblation would be repaid [ TeamGetMoney ] I am alive why are you surprised Is it because you were hiding Behind all of those lies The love of my life Turned my wrongs right But vanished into the night Now I’m paying the ultimate price [ Lola Sebastian ] She wasn’t there, O’day! Not yester, nor ever could she be placed And still, I wait, O’day! To stumble upon her face [ TeamGetMoney ] Let’s hold hands and dance with the stars Didn’t think we’d make it this far You stayed down for the cause Still a 10 out of 10 with all your flaws I must admit baby you got the sauce [ Lola Sebastian ] I was in love! Hear ye! With someone beyond this darkened odd realm She was a god, hear ye! Someone beyond myself I gave my life, hear ye! To dance in the stars, to see her above But I’ll admit, hear ye! Ceramic is all I was",

Take a walk abroad, and make a stop in my backyard\r Those stars come visit every night, I say they can’t be far\r She knows something none of us can even dream\r But if we talk again tonight I’ll tell you what she said to me\r She is delicate and so sincere\r I’d tell her anything, I know she’d hear\r She’s there for anyone I’d care to name\r Just look out there someday\r The Sky has conversations with herself, like I do all the time\r She told me this, and then I knew that I’d be fine\r The Sky has lights just like mine, she told me this one year\r The stars in my head are only there, because my head’s up here\r Come on!
