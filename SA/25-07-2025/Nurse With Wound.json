Rogerson, S. Stapleton , A. McKenzie.\nTrumpet: D. Tibet.\nTuba, Organ, Electronics, Sounds: S. Stapleton .\nSwansong:\nVoice: T. Wallis, S. Stapleton , D. Rogerson\nDada (Ostranenie 1913 Version):\nJ. Fothergill, D. Tibet. , Sinan, S. Stapleton\nA Missing Sense was originally conceived as a private tape to accompany my taking of LSD. When in that particular state, Robert Ashley's Automatic Writing was the only music I could actually experience without feeling claustrophobic and paranoid. We played it endlessly; it seemed to become part of the room, perfectly blending with the late night city ambience and the 'breathing' of the building. I decided to make my own version using the basic structure of Ashley's masterpiece, but making it more personal, adding natural sound that I could hear in my environment. It should be played at very low volume.\nSwansong is a vocal piece which was spewed out after watching a documentary on the American A-Bomb tests off the Bikini Islands which left me sad, helpless and fucking angry - an ocean of death.",

            "about": "Personnel:\nSteven Stapleton\nDavid Tibet\nMichael Cashmore\nColin Potter\nSleeve Notes:\nNurse With Wound and Current Ninety Three:\nSteven Stapleton , David Tibet , with Michael Cashmore.\nMixed by Steven Stapleton with David Tibet.\nEngineered by Colin Potter at the Water Tower.\nCut by Denis at Country Masters.\nCover by Santini and Tibet.\nThanks to Matt Black, Paul Jackson at Othila, Ross, Thomas Ligotti, 3 Serpents, and special thanks to Scarflatti for chemical amusement aid.\nIn August 2000 I was taken into hospital in London. I was vomiting many brown grains, was in great pain and was unable to walk. The doctors were unsure as to what the actual illness might be. They injected me with morphine, put a tube down my nose into my stomach to drain the poison, and inserted a catheter to drain my urine. I was then diagnosed with peritonitis , but they were still unsure as to what the specific nature of the peritonitis was. Their tests showed that I was suffering severe blood poisoning, and my stomach and all related bowel functions had shut down. They operated the same night; I was wheeled into the operating theatre with an icon of St. Pantaleimon accompanying me. I woke up with a ten inch long scar down my stomach from the pubic area up towards the centre of my chest, avoiding in a sweet swerve, the navel; the scar had been beautifully stapled together in twenty-five places. I was told that my appendix had burst some time before and had become gangrenous. They said the inside of my stomach was covered in pus. They said I had been very few days away from dying. They said I should have been in a lot more pain than I had been when I was admitted into the hospital. They introduced more morphine into the epidural tube that had been inserted into my back hilst under anaesthetic. I did not have a great deal of awareness as to where I was. But I could already see helicopters chattering over me, and they followed me to the ward. I was in London and was Nowhere. Check the hands of the watch for time, for time; and do not say 'This time is mine'...All shine, allshine: Someone Bright appears and says 'Your time is Mine!' The two gentlemen next to me were very very ill. I could hear their breath fighting. One man called always in the night called for anyone to save him from the Persecutors and the Staff, and he called for those who had been his Protectors in younger days, the Police or the Army or whosoever. He would scream in the night as he continually ripped the tubes out of his body externally an internally. The last words of the Man next to him and this Man was next to me were: \"Are you a Man or are you a mouse?\" Then a few long hours latyer his lungs choked on the mucus in them and he passed on. I saw a great and terrible and aweful Angel sweep down to him from the roof of the ward. He was clad in close Purple, and was the Angel of Death Samael. He did not take the Man's Soul. He disappeared suddenly. I did not see him go or where. But he left a Psychopomp: a great cube, perhaps five feet of length in all dimensions. Its nearest colour would be a deep slate-grey, but its nature was that of a Black Hole which,m we are told, sucks all energy from around it and takes it to some new and perhaps terrible place. Pychopomp's task was to guard the Soul of the Man till the Four Last Things. It was to wait by the soul of the Man until the Four Last Things: \"...Memento quatuor novissima, those foure inevitable points of us all, Death, Judgement, Heaven and Hell.\" - Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici, 1642. . All of the lyrics on Bright Yellow Moon were written in hospital whilst I saw these things and felt these things and knew these things. So 'Any Man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know fopr whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.\" - John Donne, Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, 1624. When I crosssed that ssea is not known when I crosssssed that sssea is not know whe n I crossde that seeaa is notkn own when ik crosseddd tha seeeeaa issn otkn wonn. This I dedicate to Andria Annette Degens who saved my life and won't say more than to thank all of those who sent me flowers and cards.\nDavid Tibet, London, February 4, 2001.",

            "about": "In the post-World Serpent world, it's refreshing to see a tasteful looking, properly packaged, elegant layout on a Nurse With Wound release which isn't completely driven by capitalism or auctionable (or even questionable) \"special\" editions.\nCover artwork is collected from a few of Steve's own personal favorite paintings for the original cover (all were different on the original 1987 issue) and the overall design echoes what has worked for Nurse in the past.\nAlthough all the music has been released before (both on LP and various CDs), everything is currently out of print. This is the first time all the songs have been reunited on a CD, and it sounds wonderful.\nTracks were originally gathered from cassette-only releases, compilations, a live bit, and other odds and ends. All have been remastered and sound more vibrant than ever.",

            "about": "This 3 x CD album is a 3 hour anthology of 52 previously unreleased ‘electronica’ and ambient soundscapes from the last 25 years, 1990 – 2015. The album is a mature blend of brand new material, up-dated and adapted pieces and raw, untouched and unadulterated tracks from yesteryear. Released in a deluxe 8 panel fold-out digipack.\n‘Miscellany – Lussuoso’ is the 3rd release in the ‘Miscellany’ archive series, the first being the 13 CDR box set ‘Miscellany – Deluxe’ and the second being the 3 L.P. box set ‘Miscellany Deluxe (Souvenirs Perdus d’Antan)’.\nIt’s been an incredibly enjoyable experience putting together this 3 disc anthology. I can remember where and when each and every one of these recordings were made. A lot of the tracks were made using a SH101, Alesis MMT-8, Akai X7000 sampler and Tascam four track tape machine, all second-hand, and even at the time fairly primitive technology. One of the earliest tracks was made at a studio in North London, they used what must of been the earliest version of Cubase, at the time it was the height of sophistication.\nThe majority of the tracks were made in the early 90’s in London, an era when I was listening to a lot of music from the emerging ‘ambient’ and electronica scenes. At that point I had a part time job, I worked on the till. Through various means of ‘creative accounting’ the job afforded me to buy at least one new record every lunch break. I worked near Wardour street and went shopping everyday. I bought everything that came out on Warp, Rephlex, R&S, Apollo and an assortment of other labels. These records in part influenced what I was creating at the time.\nThere is no chronological pattern to the running order of the discs, it’s up to you to ponder when they were recorded. Some tracks sound a lot older than they actually are, and others more contemporary than the year in which they were originally recorded.",
