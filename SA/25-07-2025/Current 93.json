In subsequent dreams I saw geometric faces , colours, words and shapes falling into my head. They appeared as a multitude of images; they were dreamlike yet vital, manifesting as processions of characters and scenesand dialogues that shifted between being utterly lacking in conventional perspectiveto that of being hyper-dimensional. I commenced writing furiously, and the words of Black Ships Ate The Sky are the recording of this period in my life.\nI asked those friends and artists whom I love and whose works I most admire to interpret the haunted words of that great hymn \"Idumæa\" by Charles Wesley; this piece had become an obsession for me before starting work on this albumand its face watched over all these Black Ships, providing one key to this Hallucinatory Patripassianist Dream.\nI live in an increasing awareness that a Love will some suddenly who will finally tear our skies apart. And then all Black Ships will be no more. This album was started four years ago by myself and Michael Cahsmore without whom this album would not exist, and finished four years later by myself and Ben Chasny, John Contreras and Steven Stapleton, without whom too this album would not exist. My heartfelt thanks to them for all they have done. More detailed acknowledgements can be found below, but I also wish to thank those other friends who worked on this album, for without them there would be just words. Andria, Marc, Will, Dee, Antony, Clodagh, Cosey, Chris, Shirley, Amy, Bill, William, Mark, Colin, Geoff, Al, Paul, Lance: thank you.\nThanks too to Blessed John Bradburne for prayers answered and and favours received.\nI Dedicate Black Ships Ate The Sky to our beloved friend and companion Squiggy who went on from us on St. Valentine's Day, 2006.

            "about": "Personnel:\nDavid Tibet\nMichael Cashmore\nBen Chasny\nJohn Contreras\nSteven Stapleton\nMarc Almond\nBonnie 'Prince' Billy\nBaby Dee\nIda Mercer\nAntony\nClodagh Simonds\nCosey Fanni Tutti\nChris Carter\nAndria Degens\nShirley Collins\nIris Bishop\nAmy Phillips\nWilliam Breeze\nWilliam Basinski\nColin Potter\nNotes\nParaphrasing from the Durtro site:\nThis is an absolutely ALTERNATIVE version of the BLACK SHIPS ATE THE SKY album.\nAll the tracks sung by David Tibet on this album are radically different mixes/versions of the tracks from the previously released standard version.\nThe versions of IDUMEA tend to be the same, although Marc Almond's version uses a totally different vocal take.\nThe 'alternative version' does sound very different indeed. Steven Stapleton and David Tibet worked on it for as long as they worked on the construction of the 'standard' version to make it a conceptual whole, not merely a collection of different mixes. This version was considered for being the 'proper' release of BLACK SHIPS ATE THE SKY, which is to say that Steven, Colin and David could not decide which was the most powerful and moving version. After they finished the BLACK SHIPS sessions they had 126 different mixes of 29 different songs, not including bridging sections.\nIts order, and track titles, are the same as on the 'standard' version, with the exception of the track 'Why Cæsar Is Burning': on the standard '...ATE THE SKY' edition we use Part 2 of the song, and on '...EAT THE SKY' we use Part 1.\nIt is NOT the same as the 'I AM BLACK SHIP' CD which was given to advance subscribers ONLY for 'Black Ships Ate The Sky', with the promise it would not be released in any other form, nor does it use any of the versions available on the above-mentioned 12 track CD, 'I AM BLACK SHIP'.\nAll the printed text on this album is in Coptic, and the sleeve design is totally different to BLACK SHIPS ATE THE SKY.",

            "credits": "released November 17, 2013\nPersonnel:\nSteven Stapleton\nDavid Tibet\nMichael Cashmore\nColin Potter\nSleeve Notes:\nNurse With Wound and Current Ninety Three:\nSteven Stapleton , David Tibet , with Michael Cashmore.\nMixed by Steven Stapleton with David Tibet.\nEngineered by Colin Potter at the Water Tower.\nCut by Denis at Country Masters.\nCover by Santini and Tibet.\nThanks to Matt Black, Paul Jackson at Othila, Ross, Thomas Ligotti, 3 Serpents, and special thanks to Scarflatti for chemical amusement aid.\nIn August 2000 I was taken into hospital in London. I was vomiting many brown grains, was in great pain and was unable to walk. The doctors were unsure as to what the actual illness might be. They injected me with morphine, put a tube down my nose into my stomach to drain the poison, and inserted a catheter to drain my urine. I was then diagnosed with peritonitis , but they were still unsure as to what the specific nature of the peritonitis was. Their tests showed that I was suffering severe blood poisoning, and my stomach and all related bowel functions had shut down. They operated the same night; I was wheeled into the operating theatre with an icon of St. Pantaleimon accompanying me. I woke up with a ten inch long scar down my stomach from the pubic area up towards the centre of my chest, avoiding in a sweet swerve, the navel; the scar had been beautifully stapled together in twenty-five places. I was told that my appendix had burst some time before and had become gangrenous. They said the inside of my stomach was covered in pus. They said I had been very few days away from dying. They said I should have been in a lot more pain than I had been when I was admitted into the hospital. They introduced more morphine into the epidural tube that had been inserted into my back hilst under anaesthetic. I did not have a great deal of awareness as to where I was. But I could already see helicopters chattering over me, and they followed me to the ward. I was in London and was Nowhere. Check the hands of the watch for time, for time; and do not say 'This time is mine'...All shine, allshine: Someone Bright appears and says 'Your time is Mine!' The two gentlemen next to me were very very ill. I could hear their breath fighting. One man called always in the night called for anyone to save him from the Persecutors and the Staff, and he called for those who had been his Protectors in younger days, the Police or the Army or whosoever. He would scream in the night as he continually ripped the tubes out of his body externally an internally. The last words of the Man next to him and this Man was next to me were: \"Are you a Man or are you a mouse?\" Then a few long hours latyer his lungs choked on the mucus in them and he passed on. I saw a great and terrible and aweful Angel sweep down to him from the roof of the ward. He was clad in close Purple, and was the Angel of Death Samael. He did not take the Man's Soul. He disappeared suddenly. I did not see him go or where. But he left a Psychopomp: a great cube, perhaps five feet of length in all dimensions. Its nearest colour would be a deep slate-grey, but its nature was that of a Black Hole which,m we are told, sucks all energy from around it and takes it to some new and perhaps terrible place. Pychopomp's task was to guard the Soul of the Man till the Four Last Things. It was to wait by the soul of the Man until the Four Last Things: \"...Memento quatuor novissima, those foure inevitable points of us all, Death, Judgement, Heaven and Hell.\" - Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici, 1642. . All of the lyrics on Bright Yellow Moon were written in hospital whilst I saw these things and felt these things and knew these things. So 'Any Man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankinde; And therefore never send to know fopr whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.\" - John Donne, Devotions Upon Emergent Occasions, 1624. When I crosssed that ssea is not known when I crosssssed that sssea is not know whe n I crossde that seeaa is notkn own when ik crosseddd tha seeeeaa issn otkn wonn. This I dedicate to Andria Annette Degens who saved my life and won't say more than to thank all of those who sent me flowers and cards.\nDavid Tibet, London, February 4, 2001.",

This release gathers together recordings of the two concerts we played; there were no studio recordings.\nThe first concert was at The Equinox Event, which took place at The London Musician's Co-op in Camden Town, North London, on June 21, 1983. Dogs Blood Order were then: David Tibet and John Murphy. The sound was mixed by Roger Smith. The second was at the Clarendon, in Hammersmith, West London, on October 6, 1983. Dogs Blood Order were now: David Tibet, John Murphy, Roger Smith, and Derek (second name forgotten, though he had played for SPK). The sound was mixed by Steven Stapleton and John Fothergill, of Nurse With Wound.\nThe image on the cover, Maldoror Is Dead, was the first piece of art designed by Steven Stapleton for us. I can never thank him enough for all he has done for and with me. The reocrding of The Equinox Event was done onto low quality cassette. The recording at The Clarendon was done onto stereo 1/4\" tape. Three people clapped at the end of the latter concert. They were being sarcastic.\nThanks to Steven Stapleton, Geoff Cox-Dorée, John Balance, Michael Cashmore, Christoph Heemann, and kat for all their help over the years. To Alan, Alison and David at World Serpent. And to Denis Blackham for his great skill at CD mastering at Country Masters. Photograph of David Tibet by Fiona Burr, 1983.\nThe Culling Game. No-one noticed.\nDavid Tibet, London, August, 1997.",

In some cases, we have chosen an extract from these earlier pieces rather than the entirety of it.\nI have to thank all those many friends who have helped me over this period in different shapes, epsecially those that have played on these pieces.

            "about": "This mid-price CD comprises five tracks performed live by Current 93 in 1992 and 1993. The sound quality is average; however, since these are performances which I especially liked I decided to release them nonetheless as memories of the occasions for myself and others.\nTracks 1 and 4 were recorded at the Church of St. Germain, Amiens, France on Hallowe'en Night 1992, Tracks 2 and 3 were recorded at the Walthamstow Royal Standard, London July 20, 1992. Track 5 was recorded at the Passage de Nord-Ouest, Paris on January 5, 1993.\nThe line-up in Amiens was: Tibet - vocals; Douglas P, - stick guitar, percussion, vocals; Michael Cashmore - acoustic guitar; James Malindaine-Lafayette - harp; Rose McDowall - semi-acoustic guitar, vocals; James Mannox - percussion, vocals. Live sound by Robert Lee.\nThe line-up in London was: David Tibet - vocals; Douglas P. - stick guitar, percussion, vocals; Rose McDowall - semi-acoustic guitar, vocals; James Mannox - percussion, vocals; Nick Saloman - electric and acoustic guitars; Karl Blake - bass; John Balance - vocals; Joolie Wood - violin, whistles, clarinet, vocals; Michael Cashmore - acoustic guitars; Steven Stapleton - ceaseless rhythm. Live sound by Ken Thomas.\nThe line-up in Paris was: David Tibet - vocals; Douglas P. - stick guitar, percussion, vocals; Michael Cashmore - acoustic guitar; James Mannox - percussion, vocals; Joolie Wood - violin, whistles, clarinet, vocals; Starfish - Spacewoman. Live sound by Gus.\nMy thanks to Katrin and Marieke. Long will I treasure the latter's Christmas present. And also to Bob Binh. And also to Starfish. This was cut at Porky's by Denis and distributed by the trinity at World Serpent. Gilt Noddies to all of them, too. Front cover design by Hildegard of Bingen. Back inlay design by Daniel Mangeon. Black and white photos of Amiens by Ma. Colour photograph by Starfish.\n\"Why then, Christ is everywhere, like the snow\", he replied\n\"Yes; everywhere we see the ice crystal's form. This immaculate pure ice world is a heavenly domain of Jesus. His Eye is the sparkled body of each lovely flake. His lush snow world is the white pastured field. The snow, the snow: lovely, lovely and cruel, cruel. Christ as the Comforter, Christ as the Spurner. Christ Ecstatic - and Christ Desolate.\"\n\"Why then; there are two Christs of which you speak. We cannot take the one without the other, I see. Thank you. I shall take both...\"\nExtract from The Broken Heart Of Man\nSince this New Year of 1993 I have been reflecting on questions people have asked me concerning the song Hitler As Kalki (SDM) and my views on Hitler. I am in no doubt: Hitler was Antichrist; Jesus killed Hitler - eventually... We can hope that it should have been much sooner, but for whatever reasons it was not to be. Unfortunately since Hitler's death, all around his cruel spirit lives and multiplies, and many antichrists now surround us. In the dark corners of the nightworld he and his followers wait, emerging once more and more into the day. I remember my father telling me of his experience as a member of the first British troops to enter the extermination camp of Belsen, and the hell on earth he found there. So then, perhaps this earth is hell, but it rests to us to ensure that we defend our own hearts against the call from the abyss. May all be happy; may all be aware. The Little Shining Man approaches. Terrify not Man, lest God terrify you.\nDavid Tibet, London, January 10, 1993.\n\"Now I know that any human face, however vile, becomes the face of Christ when it is struck.\" Michel Tournier, The Erl-King",

This was BaddenedBlackenedTime, as I watched friends spin down and fall and fall—it is hard to keep riding when the structure is sliding. So that’s what I called HorseyTime, and I can still hear their fear. Now, in SADDLE with House of Mythology, C93 are OverMoon to RIDE again with this extended reissue.\"",

            "credits": "released November 24, 2013\nPersonnel:\nDavid Tibet\nDouglas P.\nTony Wakeford\nRose McDowall\nSteven Stapleton\nFreya Aswynn\nColin Potter\nJohn Balance\nMichael Cashmore\nDavid Kenny\nNick Saloman\nGreg Orion Chance\nBarry McCarus\nJoolie Wood\nSleeve Notes:\nThis CD brings together the studio material from the Looney Runes release, and all material from Lucifer Over London, Tamlin and Misery Farm titles. Tracks 1 and 2 are from Looney Runes (Durtro 004), originally released on vinyl and CD in 1990; I have removed the live material recorded in Tokyo in 1988 as I do not wish to listen to it ever again. Tracks 3, 4 and 5 are from Lucifer Over London (Durtro 019), released on vinyl and CD in 1994, and recorded whilst we were making the album Of Ruine Or Some Blazing Starre. Tracks 6 and 7 are from Tamlin (Durtro 025), released for Hallowe'en 1994; there were 2000 numbered copies of the 12\" and 3000 numbered copies of the CD. The cover painting for the original issue, Arboreal Cult, was by Austin Osman Spare. As I no longer own this painting I have removed it from the artwork. Misery Farm (no Durtro catalogue number, though the pressing plant's manufacturing code was 33839/2) was recorded during the sessions for Lucifer Over London and was a cover of the English music hall classic song by Tommy Handley. 626 copies were made and it was sold at the shows by Current 93 at their three evenings in 1999 at the Tonic Club in New York City. All these items are now deleted. All music and lyrics © David Tibet/Current 93/Michael Cashmore/whoever/whenever except where noted. Sleeve design by David Tibet and Paul Jackson. All flora and most line drawings by Louis Wain from paintings by him in the collection of David Tibet. Drawing of Lucifer by TM of Antwerp. Looney Runes and Merrie Malaise paintings by James Mannox from an idea by David Tibet. Cut by Denis Blackham at Skye Mastering. Thanks to World Serpent.\nSpecific details of the group members are to be found after the relevant songs and sections, in the notes that I wrote at the time of the original release.\nThank you and Goodbye. David Tibet, London, 24 March 2004.\n'Panzer Ruin' and 'That's All, Folks' were remixed by Steven Stapleton from the track 'Panzer Rune' on the album Swastikas For Noddy. Current 93 were not, on this song, David Tibet, Douglas P., Tony Wakeford, Rose McDowall, Freya Aswynn and Steven Stapleton. Lyrics traditional. Engineered by Colin Potter at ICR Studios, Tollerton, York.\n'Lucifer Over London' Parts I and II were inspired primarily by the short story 'The Tower of Moab' by Leslie Allin lewis (1899-1961), found in his superlative collection Tales Of The Grotesque, (Philip Alan, 1934; Ghost Story Press, 1994 and 2003), although the idea and the images in the song are primarily my own. Vocals-David Michael Tibet by the Grace of God, and John Balance by the Grace of Austin Osman Spare and the Zos Kia Cultus. He thanks the Gods that be he sees Himself as no other seeeh him. I thank God that I do. Guitars, bass, tambourine - Michael Cashmore by the Grace of Gnoddy. Second guitar - David Kenny by the Grace of Energy. Black Sabbath - Nick Saloman by the Grace of the Bevis Frond. This song is dedicated to my dear friend Richard Dalby, who delves still. 'Sad-Go-Round' was written by Tony (TS) McPhee, and appeared on the Groundhogs' Solid album in 1974. Acoustic guitar and bass - Michael Cashmore. Lead guitar and electric dulcimer - Nick Saloman. Vocals - David Michael. This song is dedicated to Rosemary Pardoe, the editor of Ghosts and Scholars, my favourite magazine.\n'The Seven Seals Are Revealed At The End Of Time As Seven Bows: The Bloodbow, The Pissbow, The Painbow, The Faminebow, The Deathbow, The Angerbow, The Hohohobow' was written as a sequel to John Balance's introduction to Coil's Horse Rotorvator album. Once I looked at the starres and they were all blood. This song is dedicated to the Soul of my beloved and most dear cats MAO and RAO who are dead by the Grace of the LordNothing and sleeps, I pray, in Louis Wain's paradise - bounce the ball still Maoma and Raora...I slept I dreamed I dreamt a dream and He still lived. Sometimes I sit alone in my room and stare out of the window beyond beyond and beyond; Christ dances around and around the sun, but it does not stop its circling and neither can I. Vocals - David Michael. Acoustic guitar, bass, melodica and glöckenspiel - Michael Cashmore. Sheep Ventilator Guitar and Secret Weapon - Steven Stapleton.\nAll tracks mixed by Steven Stapleton, engineered by Davdi Kenny and produced by Current 93 and Greg Orion Chance. © Durtrohoho 1994. 'Sad-Go-Round' by Tony (TS) McPhee, (p) Heat Music, arranged by Current 93.\n\"The biggest danger, that of losing oneself, can pass off in a world as quietly as if it were nothing; every loss, an arm, a leg, five dollar, a wife, etc., is bound to be noticed.\" Kierkegaard, The Sickness Unto Death 1849.\n'Tamlin' is a traditional folk song from the British Isles, and Current 93 has adapted one of it's many settings for this recording. Our version was specifically influenced by the greatest version of the song, sung by Anne Briggs. For me, the song reveals that true love finally conquers all, even hell itself. 'Tamlin' traditional/arranged Current 93.\nCurrent 93: in the garden they sat with Puck or Pan or Gog or Magog or something too real to believe or to believe in: David Tibet - vocals; Michael Cashmore - guitars and bass; Steven Stapleton. Mixed by David Tibet and David Kenny. Engineered by David Kenny. This was recorded at the Simmel Acres Farm Studio in the village of Randalls; our thanks to the staff at the Flaming Hand Inn who so generously showed us some of their customs and dances. My thanks redriverrun to: Starspace, John Balance, Paul Cheshire, Shirley Collins, The Venerable C.R. Lama Rinpoche, Richard Dalby, Tiny Tim: they have al helped me in many and different ways.\n'How The Great Satanic Glory Faded': It details how Lucifer and Lucifera in their male and female forms appeared to me as they lamented their Fall from Heaven. Current 93 once when they were young oh once when they were so young: David Michael Tibet - vocals; Michael Cashmore - acoustic guitars, bass and whistles; Nicholas Saloman - electric guitar and electric dulcimer; Steven Stapleton - he has the whole wide world and a snakehorn in his hands. Mixed by him too. Engineered by David Kenny. Tibet laughed in the corner. My thanks to Mr. Tim for his permission to reproduce this brief extract from our conversation of September 7, 1994.\nTerrify not man, or God shall terrify you. \"Love knocks and enters, but knowledge stands without.\" - The Cloud Of Unknowing Thus I wash the Stinking Gnoddo, and have become , almost, as pure as snow.\nDavid Michael Tibet , October 1994\n'Misery Farm': Current 93 treading the boards were: David Tibet, Michael Cashmore, Barry McCarus, Steven Stapleton, Joolie Wood. Recorded during the Lucifer Over London sessions, and rescued from the bin for a new York release. The old grey mare is dead.",

            "about": "Personnel:\nDavid Tibet\nDouglas P.\nTony Wakeford\nRose McDowall\nSteven Stapleton\nFreya Aswynn\nColin Potter\nJohn Balance\nMichael Cashmore\nDavid Kenny\nNick Saloman\nGreg Orion Chance\nBarry McCarus\nJoolie Wood\nSleeve Notes:\nThis CD brings together the studio material from the Looney Runes release, and all material from Lucifer Over London, Tamlin and Misery Farm titles.\nTracks 1 and 2 are from Looney Runes (Durtro 004), originally released on vinyl and CD in 1990; I have removed the live material recorded in Tokyo in 1988 as I do not wish to listen to it ever again.\nTracks 3, 4 and 5 are from Lucifer Over London (Durtro 019), released on vinyl and CD in 1994, and recorded whilst we were making the album Of Ruine Or Some Blazing Starre.\nTracks 6 and 7 are from Tamlin (Durtro 025), released for Hallowe'en 1994; there were 2000 numbered copies of the 12\" and 3000 numbered copies of the CD. The cover painting for the original issue, Arboreal Cult, was by Austin Osman Spare. As I no longer own this painting I have removed it from the artwork.\nMisery Farm (no Durtro catalogue number, though the pressing plant's manufacturing code was 33839/2) was recorded during the sessions for Lucifer Over London and was a cover of the English music hall classic song by Tommy Handley. 626 copies were made and it was sold at the shows by Current 93 at their three evenings in 1999 at the Tonic Club in New York City.\nAll these items are now deleted. All music and lyrics © David Tibet/Current 93/Michael Cashmore/whoever/whenever except where noted. Sleeve design by David Tibet and Paul Jackson. All flora and most line drawings by Louis Wain from paintings by him in the collection of David Tibet. Drawing of Lucifer by TM of Antwerp. Looney Runes and Merrie Malaise paintings by James Mannox from an idea by David Tibet. Cut by Denis Blackham at Skye Mastering. Thanks to Mark Logan.\nThank you and Goodbye. David Tibet, London, March 5, 2005.\n'Panzer Ruin' and 'That's All, Folks' were remixed by Steven Stapleton from the track 'Panzer Rune' on the album Swastikas For Noddy. Current 93 were not, on this song, David Tibet, Douglas P., Tony Wakeford, Rose McDowall, Freya Aswynn and Steven Stapleton. Lyrics traditional. Engineered by Colin Potter at ICR Studios, Tollerton, York.\n'Lucifer Over London' Parts I and II were inspired primarily by the short story 'The Tower of Moab' by Leslie Allin lewis (1899-1961), found in his superlative collection Tales Of The Grotesque, (Philip Alan, 1934; Ghost Story Press, 1994 and 2003), although the idea and the images in the song are primarily my own. Vocals-David Michael Tibet by the Grace of God, and John Balance by the Grace of Austin Osman Spare and the Zos Kia Cultus. He thanks the Gods that be he sees Himself as no other seeeh him. I thank God that I do. Guitars, bass, tambourine - Michael Cashmore by the Grace of Gnoddy. Second guitar - David Kenny by the Grace of Energy. Black Sabbath - Nick Saloman by the Grace of the Bevis Frond. This song is dedicated to my dear friend Richard Dalby, who delves still. 'Sad-Go-Round' was written by Tony (TS) McPhee, and appeared on the Groundhogs' Solid album in 1974. Acoustic guitar and bass - Michael Cashmore. Lead guitar and electric dulcimer - Nick Saloman. Vocals - David Michael. This song is dedicated to Rosemary Pardoe, the editor of Ghosts and Scholars, my favourite magazine.\n'The Seven Seals Are Revealed At The End Of Time As Seven Bows: The Bloodbow, The Pissbow, The Painbow, The Faminebow, The Deathbow, The Angerbow, The Hohohobow' was written as a sequel to John Balance's introduction to Coil's Horse Rotorvator album. Once I looked at the starres and they were all blood. This song is dedicated to the Soul of my beloved and most dear cats MAO and RAO who are dead by the Grace of the LordNothing and sleeps, I pray, in Louis Wain's paradise - bounce the ball still Maoma and Raora...I slept I dreamed I dreamt a dream and He still lived. Sometimes I sit alone in my room and stare out of the window beyond beyond and beyond; Christ dances around and around the sun, but it does not stop its circling and neither can I. Vocals - David Michael. Acoustic guitar, bass, melodica and glöckenspiel - Michael Cashmore. Sheep Ventilator Guitar and Secret Weapon - Steven Stapleton.\nAll tracks mixed by Steven Stapleton, engineered by Davdi Kenny and produced by Current 93 and Greg Orion Chance. © Durtrohoho 1994. 'Sad-Go-Round' by Tony (TS) McPhee, (p) Heat Music, arranged by Current 93.\n\"The biggest danger, that of losing oneself, can pass off in a world as quietly as if it were nothing; every loss, an arm, a leg, five dollar, a wife, etc., is bound to be noticed.\" Kierkegaard, The Sickness Unto Death 1849.\n'Tamlin' is a traditional folk song from the British Isles, and Current 93 has adapted one of it's many settings for this recording. Our version was specifically influenced by the greatest version of the song, sung by Anne Briggs. For me, the song reveals that true love finally conquers all, even hell itself. 'Tamlin' traditional/arranged Current 93.\nCurrent 93: in the garden they sat with Puck or Pan or Gog or Magog or something too real to believe or to believe in: David Tibet - vocals; Michael Cashmore - guitars and bass; Steven Stapleton. Mixed by David Tibet and David Kenny. Engineered by David Kenny. This was recorded at the Simmel Acres Farm Studio in the village of Randalls; our thanks to the staff at the Flaming Hand Inn who so generously showed us some of their customs and dances. My thanks redriverrun to: Starspace, John Balance, Paul Cheshire, Shirley Collins, The Venerable C.R. Lama Rinpoche, Richard Dalby, Tiny Tim: they have al helped me in many and different ways.\n'How The Great Satanic Glory Faded': It details how Lucifer and Lucifera in their male and female forms appeared to me as they lamented their Fall from Heaven. Current 93 once when they were young oh once when they were so young: David Michael Tibet - vocals; Michael Cashmore - acoustic guitars, bass and whistles; Nicholas Saloman - electric guitar and electric dulcimer; Steven Stapleton - he has the whole wide world and a snakehorn in his hands. Mixed by him too. Engineered by David Kenny. Tibet laughed in the corner. My thanks to Mr. Tim for his permission to reproduce this brief extract from our conversation of September 7, 1994.\nTerrify not man, or God shall terrify you. \"Love knocks and enters, but knowledge stands without.\" - The Cloud Of Unknowing Thus I wash the Stinking Gnoddo, and have become , almost, as pure as snow.\nDavid Michael Tibet , October 1994\n'Misery Farm': Current 93 treading the boards were: David Tibet, Michael Cashmore, Barry McCarus, Steven Stapleton, Joolie Wood. Recorded during the Lucifer Over London sessions, and rescued from the bin for a new York release. The old grey mare is dead.",

            "about": "Sleeve Notes:\nFollowing the unofficial availability of a live version of this song recorded at the Tonic Club in New York City on March 6, 1999, we decided to issue that track ourselves. Along with the live track, we have also added three demo versions of the same piece, recorded by us at Barry Ramon's studio in June 1999. This song was originally intended for a Current 93 album, but this idea mutated into is forthcoming appearance elsewhere.\nCurrent Ninety Three would like to thank David Tibet, Michael Cashmore, Andria Tibet, Gary Ramon, Jose Pacheco, Denis Blackham and Paul Jackson at Othila for their help with this release.\nThe text for THE SEAHORSE REARS TO OBLIVION was written by David Tibet during the sessions for the SOFT BLACK STARS album. Its only live performance at the time of writing was at the New York show mentioned above.\nThe front cover of the CD reproduces an untitled painting by Louis Wain which he created during the 1930s at the County Mental Hospital in Napsbury. It is from the collection of David Tibet, who wishes to thank Henry Boxer for acquiring it on his behalf. The back cover reproduces a colour negative of the same image.\n\"The merman stands at a dialectical extremity\":\nKierkegaard: FEAR AND TREMBLING (1843).\nThe SEAHORSES are Shadows in this Previous TIME of the FOUR HORSES.\nJanuary 2003.\nGod is Love. God is Love. God is Love.",

Statue of Kalki supplied through the kindness of Simon Norris.\nThe Thunder: Perfect Mind:\nTracks 1 to 8 were recorded during the Thunder Perfect Mind sessions but were left off the original album due to lack of time or because they were an alternative mix that we felt did not fit.

The personnel on these songs is as for the studio album; Rose McDowall is the lead vocal on 'In Sadness Sang'.\nTracks 9 to 13 were recorded at a live show at La Lune des Pirates in Amiens, France on 15 December 1990, and were previously released on the album As The World Disappears...

Tie it up and make of it the True Love Knot. May all be happy. God is Love.

This was BaddenedBlackenedTime, as I watched friends spin down and fall and fall—it is hard to keep riding when the structure is sliding. So that’s what I called HorseyTime, and I can still hear their fear. Now, in SADDLE with House of Mythology, C93 are OverMoon to RIDE again with this extended reissue.\"",

Down by the River, Beside the Water, and none of these run ETERNAL, except the Immortal Bird, as high as sky.\nNow, in BED with House of Mythology, C93 are OverMoon to SLEEP again with this extended reissue, on 2LP, 2CD, and cassette, remastered from the original tapes by Michael Lawrence as The Bricoleur. SLEEP HAS HIS HOUSE is released at the same time as an expanded edition of HORSEY. These are the first two releases in an expansive and extended series of C93 reissues with HoM.",
