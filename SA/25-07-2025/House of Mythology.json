Down by the River, Beside the Water, and none of these run ETERNAL, except the Immortal Bird, as high as sky.\nNow, in BED with House of Mythology, C93 are OverMoon to SLEEP again with this extended reissue, on 2LP, 2CD, and cassette, remastered from the original tapes by Michael Lawrence as The Bricoleur. SLEEP HAS HIS HOUSE is released at the same time as an expanded edition of HORSEY. These are the first two releases in an expansive and extended series of C93 reissues with HoM.",

            "about": "Come horns and trumpets, come echo and percussion. The descent into the subterranean fields is easy. But to retrace your steps into heaven's air: There is the trouble, there is the toil.\nBeheaded Totem, the second album by the enigmatic Portuguese ensemble HHY & The Macumbas, leads us straight into the damp caves of our minds. Their 2014 debut Throat Permission Cut was described as ‚Äúa massive synapses bombardment in a short circuit between Glenn Branca and Adrian Sherwood,‚Äù and yes: HHY & The Macumbas have continued their march into the undiscover‚Äôd countries of psychoacoustics. Febrile, haunting and at times overwhelming, Beheaded Totem is nothing short of a dream for the necro-tourist. Cerebral and alluring. Toxic. Welcome to the four-dimensional meltdown.\n‚ÄúBeheaded Totem continues a long investigation into percussion, circular rhythms, dub strategies, and horns coming from the alcohol-fuelled Portuguese marching bands,‚Äù says constructor and conductor in the world of HHY & The Macumbas, Jonathan Uliel Saldanha. For those not familiar with the Macumbas, they are a shifting musical entity. Built amid smoke and fiery red lights, the performers on Beheaded Totem are: Jo√£o Pais, Filipe Silva, Frank√£o and Brendan Hemsworth on percussion, and √Ålvaro Almeida, Andr√© Rocha and Rui Fernandes on horns. An Arkestra reaching not for the stars but the boiling core under our feet.\nThis music stems from a deep connection with the streets of Porto and its undertones, nights and drags,‚Äù Saldanha says. Emerging from SOOPA, an art and music production unit based in the old harbour city, he has been a leading force in the Portuguese experimental music scene since the early 2000s, through which he coined a signature ‚Äúskull-cave echo.‚Äù\n‚ÄúIt comes with a love for trance, otherness and sound pressure,‚Äù he explains. Beheaded Totem is indeed a pulsating and physical album, revealing both an ultimate pain and unbearable joy ‚Äì a funereal ecstasy ‚Äì as if everything might collapse in on itself at any moment. The disruptive nature of the seven tracks also hints at a free form. They are more evocations than songs, found in the depths Saldanha reached for in the filmic and musical explorations of Tunnel Vision (2016), made alongside director and musician Raz Mesinai. Recorded in tunnels and cavities in and around the city of Porto, the sub-frequencies of Tunnel Vision functioned as a panoramic documentation of the underground, a ‚Äúdub fiction,‚Äù as Mesinai put it. Add the Macumbas‚Äô already famed live capacities evoked on this album, and Beheaded Totem comes across as a fearless interpretation of sulphurous storms. Both meticulous and massive, raw and ravishing, as if their minds are set on rewilding a hollow earth.\nAnd as the nightly creatures prepare themselves to join HHY & The Macumbas in a final Danse Macabre, they might realize what they‚Äôre in for: to never find their way back to the corrosions of daylight. But, then again, some sacrifices come with joy.\n‚Äì Tore Engelsen Espedal, May 2018\nLabel: House of Mythology |  houseofmythology.com |mark@mythology-live.com\nManagement: Amplificasom |  amplificasom.com  |  andre@amplificasom.com\nBooking: Odyssey Booking |  www.odysseybooking.com |vincent@odysseybooking.com",

            "about": "The Barbarossa Cave is located in the Kyffh√§user region of Germany, and takes its name from a local legend. According to such lore, Frederick Barbarossa ‚Äì former German monarch and Roman Emperor of the twelfth century ‚Äì slumbers within these caverns in a palace beneath the Kyffh√§user hills, his beard growing in circles around the table at which he rests, until either he reigns once more over a unified Germany, or the end of the world; whichever arrives first.\n‚ÄúI was and still am obsessed with caves,‚Äù relates Alexander Kloster-Jensen (Alex K), main source of the creative vision behind Norway‚Äôs enigmatic Kitchie Kitchie Ki Me O (KKKMO), who was inspired by a visit to this mythic location during the cathartic period that led to their new and long-awaited album Are You Land or Water on House of Mythology. ‚ÄúThe beautiful rivers of water flowing inside and through caves. There are sleeping national myths all across Europe waiting to be explored and exploited and the Barbarossa myth is one of them.‚Äù\nKitchie Kitchie Ki Me O has bloodlines in the much-heralded Madrugada, whose albums Industrial Silence and Grit remain pivotal statements in Norwegian alternative rock, sculpting brooding and emotionally charged anthems as dramatic as they were captivating. Robert Bur√•s ‚Äì the band‚Äôs main songwriter ‚Äì initially broke off to pursue a more garage-rock-oriented direction with My Midnight Creeps. Yet after his sad passing in 2007, Kitchie Kitchie Ki Me O evolved from said band, taking ingredients from Dr. John the (Nite) Tripper-style voodoo and Mali-blues (Ali Farka Tour√©, Tinariwen) to forge the idiosyncratic rock-sound captured on their 2011 self-titled debut for EMI, which met with both considerable critical acclaim and sold-out shows for the band in their homeland.\nAre You Land or Water arrives at the end of a tumultuous period for Kitchie Kitchie Ki Me O following this debut, one in which they experienced both their studio being demolished and a takeover of their previous label, and in which Alex nearly quit music altogether. ‚ÄúMusic didn't mean anything to me anymore,‚Äù he reflects. ‚ÄúI started to escape on my self-built bike, cycling into the woods around Oslo and doing long rides to other cities, discovering the satisfaction of being alone and in motion through the landscape. Just fast enough and far enough to discover real adventure.‚Äù However, it wasn‚Äôt long before he was coaxed back into action, initially with studio-based jams with Bez Farazollahi and frequent Ulver collaborator Anders M√∏ller. ‚ÄúIt was relaxed and free floating without any meaning and purpose,‚Äù notes Alex. ‚ÄúIt reminded me of cycling ‚Ä¶ just getting from A to B‚Äù.\nWhat eventually resulted inspired by not only the likes of Earth, Grinderman, Talk Talk and Gato Barbieri yet existing firmly in its own melancholic headspace, is a record very different from the band‚Äôs debut. Nocturnal rock songs like the expansive ‚ÄòSaleph‚Äô and ‚ÄòGoing Forth by Day‚Äô ‚Äì inspired by the same-named art exhibition by Bill Viola (Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin, 2002) ‚Äì interweave with moments of spectral ambience such as the beautifully brooding ‚ÄòEuropa‚Äô, creating a distinctly cinematic vision ‚Äì richly diverse without losing the primal charge that‚Äôs guided the band since their inception.\nThus, somewhere from the anhydrite layers of the Barbarossa cave ‚Äì whose location ended up titling two tracks on the album ‚Äì arrived both a mythic intensity and a sense of tranquillity that have guided Alex and KKKMO through tribulations aplenty to discover new sonic landscapes to explore: ‚ÄúI wanted to design an experience that was warm and non-intrusive this time around. I have always been more interested in sounds and texture than making hit-songs,‚Äù reflects Alex. ‚ÄúAre You Land or Water is about tension, and describes the states of passive and active. You can not be the two at the same time, but the two states are equally important.‚Äù\n‚Äì Jimmy Martin",

            "about": "In Newton‚Äôs basic laws of motion ‚Äì those which lie at the heart of modern physics ‚Äì the paradox stands that constant velocity is essentially as natural as being at rest. True to form, in the now twenty-two-year-old life of Ulver, only one constant has remained, that being a forward-driving spirit that has moved this mercurial Norwegian-based collective forever through challenges and adventure anew, irrespective of reductive genre pigeonholing. Moreover, their latest voyage into the unknown is no different, marking another new chapter for an outfit characterised by wild and inspiring unpredictability, along with a fresh triumph for one of modern music‚Äôs most iconoclastic forces.\nThe basis for ATGCLVLSSCAP ‚Äì which the band has been working with under the moniker ‚Äò12‚Äô ‚Äì arrives from recordings made at twelve different live shows that Ulver performed in February 2014, in which band the band vaulted into the deep end of an improvisatory approach to their performance. As Kristoffer Rygg, the prime mover of the band since its inception puts it wryly, ‚ÄúThe tour was to be an experiment, kind of loose and scary for a band as ‚Äòset in their ways‚Äô as us.‚Äù\nAlthough the line-up for these shows remained similar to that on 2012‚Äôs psychedelic covers album Childhood‚Äôs End, and the band had taken succour from the sounds and headspace they explored on that record, this was another break into new territory, using their live energy and spontaneity as the fuel for aural explorations that would surprise even the band themselves. ‚ÄúAt the end of any album process, I can‚Äôt wait to do something else,‚Äù comments Rygg. ‚ÄùSo yeah, it is partly borne out of that feeling, being a bit bored with the circumstances. It was quite liberating to do something more in the moment. One night a jam could be five minutes, and the next it could be fifteen. We couldn‚Äôt have captured these songs in a studio environment.‚Äù\nOnce the tour was over, it was down to his bandmate Daniel O‚ÄôSullivan to take charge of these multitrack recordings, sculpting and editing hours of material in his North London enclave, formerly owned by charismatic artist and Coil associate, the sadly departed Ian Johnstone ‚Äì as O‚ÄôSullivan noted, ‚ÄúThe hungry ghosts of the now empty house appear to be burrowing into this record.‚Äù Anders M√∏ller, Kristoffer Rygg and Tore Ylwizaker got involved a bit later, honing things from their end in Subsonic Society and Oak Hill Studios, Oslo, before the vinyl cutting process took place at THD Vinyl Mastering, also in Oslo, in which the band was fully involved in the crucial initial cut of the 14‚Äù lacquer. What resulted is the widescreen sweep and atmospheric splendour of ATGCLVLSSCAP, ultimately a piece of work that exists above and beyond any conventional live recording, rather a hallucinatory travelogue as potent an experience to bear witness to as it was to construct.\nAs always in the world of Ulver, influences are disparate and diverse, yet as Rygg notes, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs quite tributary in a way, there are clear nods to sounds from the past.‚Äù Many of these dwell in progressive, electronic and krautrock realms, heralding a lifelong love within the band for the music of the 70s ‚Äì the fiery mantras of ‚ÄòOm Hanumate Namah‚Äô and the motorik drive of ‚ÄòCromagnosis‚Äô draw an astral trajectory between the propulsion of Kraftwerk/Neu! and the ritualistic intensity of prime Amon D√º√ºl II, whilst the spirits of both Klaus Schulze and John Carpenter are audible in the electronic soundscapes of ‚ÄòDesert/Dawn‚Äô, not to mention the Bernard Herrmann touch in the closing ‚ÄòSolaris‚Äô. Even when the band revisits an earlier gem from 2000‚Äôs Perdition City album, as on ‚ÄòNowhere (Sweet Sixteen)‚Äô, its reinvigorated by their expansive and emotionally charged approach.\n‚ÄúWe always feel like, independently of what kind of instrumentation we use, we‚Äôre still playing the same nocturnal stuff,‚Äù laughs Rygg. ‚ÄúThere are a few motifs that keep recurring all the time in what we do, and if it‚Äôs in a rock form or an electronic form, it‚Äôs always there.‚Äù Yet as true as this may be, by shaking up their creative process, the band have summoned up a unique testimony to the creative power of a mighty force who remain blissfully free of genre or convention, ATGCLVLSSCAP is progressive in the truest sense of the word, a record that may be this capricious band‚Äôs pi√®ce-de-resistance.\n‚Äì Jimmy Martin",

            "about": "Ulver - Riverhead\nTHE STORY\nThe North Shore is a particular coastline on the island of Newfoundland that has been in various stages of settlement since the 1500s ‚Äì it is said to be one of the oldest North American settlements. As Irish and English settlers formed communities, centuries of secular feuding in Europe were inevitably rediscovered in this new land and lead to many years of fighting, rioting, and murder. As a Newfoundlander with deep roots on the island, my family has experienced this conflict first-hand and often tell stories of their rival outports, even warning me to stay away from certain communities as a child. This is the backdrop for RIVERHEAD ‚Äì an area with a fragile coexistence between communities, where inherited feuds can resurface at any moment.\nTHE SOUNDTRACK\nLate last fall I sent Kristoffer Rygg my latest short film, FLANKERS, and we began chatting about the soundtrack, eventually going back and forth about a potential collaboration. At this point, I went out on a limb and asked if ULVER would be interested in composing the music for my upcoming feature, RIVERHEAD. They kindly accepted and here is the result. As a long-time fan, this was an incredible collaboration for me ‚Äì and further, it allowed us to find aesthetic and cultural similarities between our lands. With this in mind, the soundtrack certainly touches on Nordic and Celtic folk music from within an ambient/atmospheric frame.\nThere was a mutual understanding that the soundtrack should be hushed, airy and ominous, almost elemental in its minimalism, with only a few key moments that rupture into larger, more augmented pieces. As far as the method, ULVER started by recording and sending over some sketches and atmospheres before we shot a single scene of the film. This allowed me to go into the filming with an understanding of the soundtrack, and how the scenes could (and would) be paced ‚Äì truly an invaluable asset, especially with a fragmented film like this. Afterwards, they continued to record and we fine-tuned said sketches as well as some new pieces together. Ultimately, I am as proud of this collaboration as a standalone project as I am with the film itself.\n‚Äì Justin Oakey, L'Anse aux Meadows, September 2016",

            "about": "Dear friends of house,\nwe thought it might be a nice diversion in these difficult times to make a free Bandcamp compilation of some of our favourite past, present and future HoM tracks. We have done so partly to celebrate our five-year anniversary, but mainly to help distract us a bit from the distressing world events that unfold around us. We have made it completely free, with an option for you to donate something to the label if you so wish.\nAmongst our 15 track sonic feast you will find some rather rare music such as 'Birth of Decay' by The Stargazers Assistant, a seventeen minute journey to the underworld that was until now only available on their DLP Remoteness of Light. Furthermore, we are sharing with you exclusively 'Niemandswasser IV' a dreamy, spaced out alternative version of the classic Current 93 song 'Niemandswasser'¬†‚Äì discovered by The Bricoleur while baking the original Sleep Has His House master tapes for our Current 93 reissues ‚Äì due to come soon on HoMAlpeh. New tracks from Ulver, Stian Westerhus, Use Knife and Teleplasmiste also feature.\n'Everything Burns' is an older KKKMO track perhaps unheard to many outside of Norway ‚Äì a band we hold dear to our hearts since they went on to become HOM 001 (our first ever release). We might just have to re-issue this whole album when days brighten, as it is a most excellent slab of sexy, dark rock.\nIn the meantime, we hope you are safe, avoid the crowds, wash your hands‚Ä¶ Watch and pray!\nYours,\nHouse of Mythology",

            "about": "A transformative union of two idiosyncratic tellers, Hypnopaz≈´zu sees Current 93 speller David Tibet joining forces with the eternal Youth, famed not only for his work as bassist with Killing Joke but for production and collaborative work with an outlandishly eclectic list of artists from Alien Sex Fiend to Paul McCartney. Together, they‚Äôve created a singular hallucinatory vision that marries symphonic splendour to indignant gnostic intensity ‚Äì Create Christ, Sailor Boy draws in, and down, masks terrestrial and celestial and summons a collection of songs unlike anything either artist has created previously.\n‚ÄúI first met Youth in the very early ‚Äò80s at a club called the Bat Cave in Soho; I asked Youth to play bass on the first C93 album, Nature Unveiled, which he did,‚Äù relates Tibet on this partnership. ‚ÄúThen we probably didn‚Äôt have any contact for around 25 years, though I was very aware of what he was doing. A few years ago, I started working with David Bianchi, who put C93 on for two nights at London‚Äôs The Forum venue. He managed Killing Joke‚Äîand Youth and I met again through Bianchi. Youth suggested I go to his London studio and record an album with him. So I did‚Ä¶ and we did!‚Äù\nTogether, these two again manifested their sticky alchemy, with Youth‚Äôs ornate and dramatic arrangements sliding into and around Tibet's vivid hypnagogic visions to end up in a psychic picnic hinterland that is as sumptuous as it is colourful in its opulence. Nothing was discussed between them about how the album would sound, with just their Names guiding their intuitive journey into SweetDreamSound. ‚ÄúThe album worked organically: Youth created the music, and I wrote the lyrics, and it all worked as beautifully as we knew it would‚Äù notes David, ‚ÄúThere was no plan‚Äîit was spontaneously channelled by both of us from The Spheres above. Youth is the master, and only he can tell you how he summons such extraordinary music. I just sit and watch in delight and amazement. He is an Arch≈çn!‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe magical side of that first C93 album was difficult for me‚Äîseven years bad luck!‚Äù recollects Youth. ‚ÄúBut having reconnected with David a few years ago, I become aware of his great canon of work, his command of expression and his mastery with words, so I was inspired and keen to work with him again, and had a specific sound in mind.‚Äù\nTibet‚Äôs luxurious kosmoi sliding slyly onto peaks of intent and intoxication on the album, and songs such as the Galactic Sexiness of ‚ÄòThe Sex Of Stars‚Äô and the Cuneiform Cuteness of ‚ÄòThe Auras Are Escaping At The Forest‚Äô show him, backed by the emotive and expressive power of Youth‚Äôs arrangements, as a conduit turning unspelled grammars into grimoires. Nonetheless, Tibet stresses that his mode of expression here do not mark a departure from his areas of exploration in Current 93: ‚ÄúThere is no difference in terms of the ideas and the dreams and the spheres I used in this album and in this project to anything I have done with any of my other faces. They are all the same face, all 93 of them!‚Äù\n‚ÄúThe group‚Äôs name Hypnopaz≈´zu brought together 3 beings, and 2 languages, that move me and delight me and trouble me. Hypnagogia. Hypnos. Paz≈´zu. The Coptic language. The Akkadian language,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúYouth kindly allowed me to choose the name, on the basis that we called the album Create Christ, Sailor Boy, which was a line of mine that he liked, and which opens the album.‚Äù\n‚ÄúMusic-wise I wanted something analogue, psychedelic and authentic, timeless yet also contemporary,‚Äù adds Youth. ‚ÄúIn some ways I wanted the music to be invisible so you only hear the stories. The main instruments are Moog synth and my Vox Repeater vintage guitar as well as many acoustic elements and some digital elements too. It's very personal‚Ä¶ I've composed, played and engineered pretty much all of it, with minimum of assistance from my team. The inspiration, of course, comes from many sources of art, literature and film culture in general, but also the esoteric.‚Äù\nTranscendent, tumultuous, and tricky, Create Christ, Sailor Boy is the sound of two spirits skipping as one to create a sidereal glimpse into uncounted cartoons. With a London date planned for October, it seems likely this partnership will be a fruitful one, both in this realm and other playgrounds. ‚ÄúI am happy always to work with Youth in any way, forever and for ever and aways and in all ways‚Äù stresses David. ‚ÄúI wait for my Ouija Board Planchette to receive his Mind‚Äôs Eye Text.\n‚Äì Jimmy Martin, with David Tibet whispering occasionally into his AngelWitchEars",

            "about": "Tower Gardens Road was an island surrounded by privet hedge and a rich wilderness out the back, around which the grime and grot of North London flowed, never penetrating. This fortress against the modern rush was shaped and transformed inside and out by the love and creativity of Ian Johnstone, gentleman satyr and Coil affiliate. Much of the house's interior was clad in dark stained wood, a dense menagerie of power amulets and the sidereal painting of Austin Osman Spare, the foliage outside filtering sunlight into a flickering green.\nOver the years Ian Johnstone allowed those struggling against the high rents and broken loves of the capital to share his home. This generosity was repaid in the music that was created at 147 Tower Gardens, notably by Daniel O'Sullivan, who quietly foraged the sounds that made up albums by Ulver, √Üthenor and Mothlite in a room with ornately barred windows at the rear of the house. For a while he was joined there by Alexander Tucker, with whom he recorded the transportive psychedelic pop of Grumbling Fur.\nIan Johnstone died in the spring of 2015, 147 Tower Gardens becoming a place of grief and remembering as his spirit departed. The sacred interior was gradually dismantled and abandoned, in the process of packing an immense cabinet of curiosities into cardboard boxes, Daniel was visited by his friend Massimo Pupillo of Zu. The pair had met when Guapo (another of O'Sullivan's collaborations) and Zu played some shows together many moons ago. The pair share a love of sharing the creative process, and outside of Zu Pupillo has played in the Ex, and improvised with everyone from Peter Br√∂tzmann to Oren Ambarchi to FM Einheit. He spends six months of the year at his home in Peru, studying ancient wisdom and power plants with the ayahuasqueros.\nIt had originally been planned for O'Sullivan, Johnstone and Fran√ßois Testory (who provided the transcendent choral vocals to Coil‚Äôs cover of \"Going Up\", the theme to sitcom Are You Being Served?) to work together on a piece of choreography tentatively called The Black Egg. With Ian departed and Tower Gardens in a state of flux and closure, the remaining pair began work, and in the midst of a great grief sounds began to flow with little discussion, the purpose only to celebrate the artistic and human heritage of dearly departed friends through music.\nDrawing on a rich tapestry of influences ranging from the plainchant of Hildegard von Bingen to Alice Coltrane's vedantic tapes to the monolithic bass frequencies of Godflesh, Laniakea evokes eternal vibrations devoted to living spirit in perpetual becoming. These four tracks of surging drone and melodic transcendence are cosmic hymns, atomised riffs slowed and stretched to unveil a pantheon of sound in particle form.\nOn Laniakea, O'Sullivan and Pupillo distill the dusty air and must of 147 Tower Gardens Road, capturing the life and energy, art and magick that Ian Johnstone brought to this quiet, neglected and tatty corner of the metropolis. As London increasingly becomes Dubai-on-Thames, there will be few places like this in future times. Laniakea is therefore an elegy both to that house, to Johnstone, and ways of being that are increasingly suffocated, stamped out, ignored. Back at the house, the garden has gone, ripped up, destroyed, sent into smoke atop a municipal pyre. No doubt coat after coat of beige paint is being applied to try and cover the dark warm wood inside, and the ivy has been ripped from the brickwork. Ian Johnstone's objects are scattered to the winds. 147 Tower Gardens was more than a home in a storm or an island in a dying city. It was Ian, and everyone he welcomed in, and all they created there. Laniakea is a final signal, yet an eternal vibration.\n‚Äì Luke Turner",

            "about": "‚ÄúTo know what you have, and to give all of it up ‚Äì even if you know that it‚Äôs going to keep haunting you for the rest of your life. Phantom pain. Diagnosing what is the best of two evils ‚Äì is what this album is about.‚Äù\nAmputation, the new album by Stian Westerhus, may be centred on dislocation, loss and melancholia, yet from such turbulent origins a work of life-affirming catharsis has arrived. His first release for House of Mythology ‚Äì following a plethora of acclaimed collaborative and solo work ‚Äì is a triumph of experimentation and abstraction, marrying a fearless innovative drive with stark emotional resonance. Otherworldly and exhilarating, it‚Äôs the sound of a virtuoso musician throwing away both caution and co-ordinates and taking a dive into the unknown, with spellbinding results.\n‚ÄúIt¬¥s music I‚Äôve dropped to the floor repeatedly, maybe even on purpose. It‚Äôs music in a cracked mirror portraying the time it was created.‚Äù\nStian Westerhus started his musical life studying jazz, his work taking him firstly to Middlesex, where he graduated as a Bachelor of Music before his Masters at Trondheim Musikkonservatorium NTNU. Since then, he‚Äôs worked constantly, touring and recording with a dizzying array of artists including Jaga Jazzist, Supersilent, Nils Petter Molv√¶r and Motorpsycho, not to mention a series of solo records for Rune Grammofon. He has also made several commissions, like Ripples, Rapples & Disbelief with Trondheim Jazz Orchestra (2012), Longitude with Britten Sinfonia (2013) and Redundance 40 with South Netherlands Philharmonic (2014). His list of achievements is as lengthy as it is impressive, ranging from a BBC Jazz Innovation Award in 2008 to several Norwegian Grammy nominations (Spellemannprisen, where he has two awards to his name ‚Äì with Jaga Jazzist for One-Armed Bandit, category Open Class 2010, and also in the Jazz category for Didymoi Dreams, his 2013 collaboration with Sidsel Endresen). Throughout, he‚Äôs consistently found ways to create new paradigms largely via a distinct and innovative approach to the mediums of six strings, pickups, effects and amplification.\n‚ÄúFrom when all ends came loose. Pieces, like mounted in my musicianship with rusty bolts, continuously oxidizing their way through my skin.‚Äù\nAmputation, however marks new frontiers for this always bold and intrepid pathfinder, encompassing a mission in which Westerhus‚Äô ever-evolving exploration of his instrument combines with a series of soundworlds that seamlessly veer from tender melody to bracing electronic edifices of sound to convey a startlingly articulate speech of the heart. Though existing strictly in its own distinct headspace, the emotive cry of ‚ÄúHow Long‚Äù ‚Äì burnished by celestial guitar filigree and plaintive falsetto harmonies yet with a refrain that snags in the memory ‚Äì is likely to strike a chord with admirers of latter-day Scott Walker, James Blake and Ben Frost alike. Meanwhile, the two part ‚ÄúAmputation‚Äù suite of Side Two is unflinching sturm-und-drang, using both forceful assaults of binary-derived noise and eerie disquiet to convey trauma and unease with bleak yet exhilarating potency.\nSoon to be presented as a 16.1 surround sound installation at Notam in Oslo, Amputation is a fearless and uncompromising trawl into the murky depths of the psyche, one that has struck treasure in the form of an album unlike any you‚Äôll hear this year ‚Äì the sound of a mercurial artist reaching between thought and expression to arrive at a vision by turns harrowing and heavenly in its intensity.\n‚ÄúThematically it‚Äôs about leaving what is most precious and sacred behind. About accepting loss, damage and defeat. About those moments when you realize you are on the very edge of life and society as you know it.‚Äù\n‚Äì Jimmy Martin",

            "about": "This two-track EP captures a pivotal moment in time for Teleplasmiste, presenting recordings that emerged from sessions and live performances that eventually became Frequency is the New Ecstasy.\nIn December 2015 our debut release, 'Radioclast E.R.A (112hz)', appeared on a Holectics Recordings cassette, split with A.A.S, in an edition of 30 copies. A heavily edited and reworked version of Radioclast later appeared on our House of Mythology album Frequency is the New Ecstasy.\nTo celebrate the Holectics release, A.A.S., Teleplasmiste and audio-visual artist Leslie Deere performed at London‚Äôs Apiary Studios on 17 December. The Wishing Machine presents a live recording of our performance, as well as a remastered version of the original Radioclast track, which was recorded live in the studio that October.\nWe‚Äôd like to thank Graham Dunning of A.A.S. for inviting us to contribute to the cassette, organising the original gig and recording our performance, Pond Scum Light Show for their spectacular organic visuals, Ely Grey for filming the night.\n‚Äì Mark O Pilkington & Michael J York\nThis release is for digital download and streaming only.\nHOM 015\nAll music by Mark O Pilkington & Michael J York.\nMixed by Rob Kelly at Strongroom.\nReleased via House of Mythology.",

            "about": "\"Dive a kilometre into the ocean and you leave all surface illumination behind.\nDescend another ten and luminous forms flicker and burst through the endless black.\nLures and decoys in their millions ‚Äì lovers and liars, the hungry and the hunted ‚Äì drift, swarm, seethe and dart, creating a carnival of light in this kingdom of darkness, though many are too delicate to be seen by eyes that have glimpsed the sky.\nAscend now, one hundred kilometres up, surfacing into the darkness at the edge of outer space.\nHere vast forms, born of lightning, illuminate the superheated thermosphere, like luminous jellyfish, some fifty kilometres tall and wide, colossal projections of their microscopic kin below.\nAnd here we are, somewhere in between, believing we have seen the light.\"\nDavid J. Smith‚Äôs The Stargazer‚Äôs Assistant continue their exploration of worlds beyond earthly light with this new four-track* full length album.\n\"Remoteness of Light\" reveals an expanded line-up for the group, featuring:\nDavid J. Smith (Guapo, Cyclobe)\nPercussion and sampled atmospheres\nDavid J. Knight (Danielle Dax, UnicaZ√ºrn)\nTreated guitars and FX\nMichael J. York (Coil, Cyclobe)\nPipes, FX and field recordings\nAs with previous Stargazer‚Äôs releases \"Remoteness of Light\" eschews and subverts genre identification, instead drawing the listener into an unfamiliar, richly atmospheric, and elemental sound world populated by bursts of freeform percussion, spectral melodies and seething, haunted airs.\nThe album is produced by Antti Uusimaki (Panic DHH, Circle, Tindersticks etc.) and The Stargazer‚Äôs Assistant and was mastered by Helge Sten (Supersilent).\n* Track 4, ‚ÄúBirth of Decay‚Äù is a live recording only available on the double vinyl edition, or as a download for people ordering physical directly from the House of Mythology web site.",

            "about": "Propelled towards endless night; Depth and darkness press in; Shell contracting, hissing, creaking, cracking; This machine is a madness.\nNamed after a pair of steam-powered, manned submarines developed in North West England during the late nineteenth century, this fourth album from The Stargazer‚Äôs Assistant draws us once more into the depths, where sound conjures space.\nExtending the atmospheres developed for their last album ‚Äì the acclaimed Remoteness of Light (2016) ‚Äì the trio of David J. Smith (Guapo, Cyclobe), David J. Knight (UnicaZ√ºrn) and Michael J. York (Coil, Cyclobe, Teleplasmiste) reward us once again with a powerful deep listening experience. As its cavernous voids come alive with coursing textures and layers of shimmering melody, Resurgam I, Resurgam II reminds us that even in darkness, we make our own light.\nResurgam I, Resurgam II is produced and mastered by Antti Uusimaki (Panic DHH, Circle, Tindersticks etc.) and The Stargazer‚Äôs Assistant.",

            "about": "SURE, EVERYTHING IS ENDING, but not yet. Ever since David Tibet‚Äôs Current 93 sung its birth canal blues back in the early 1980s, there's been a smell of apocalypse in the air. As the American author of horror novels Thomas Ligotti put it, Tibet has over the years presented us with words and images that are ‚Äúportentous in a literal and most poetic sense.‚Äù* No matter how great or small, Tibet‚Äôs visions has sustained a sense of urgency throughout his many, many projects and towering work. 35 years on, as dark clouds once again are gathering on the horizon, his syncretic tale of the fallen empire inside us all seem to be as pertinent as ever. Arise for bad times.\nEnter Zu93, the effectively named collaboration between Tibet and the ever-changing Italian group Zu, centered around Massimo Pupillo and Luca Mai. Seven years after the collaborators first met in Rome, the most beautifully apocalyptic city of all, they can finally present Mirror Emperor, mixed and produced by Stefano Pilia. If last year‚Äôs Create Christ, Sailor Boy, the startling Hypnopaz≈´zu album Tibet made alongside Youth, the legendary producer and Killing Joke bassist, was ‚Äúa transformative union,‚Äù the imperial ghost music presented on Mirror Emperor marks a return to their earth, a tour amidst the ruins: Gentle guitars, weeping cellos, the occasional rumbling bass and soft percussion, are melted and gently poured into the sepulchral engine. Despite a few electric swirls or the odd metallic screech Mirror Emperor moves seamlessly and comes across as surprisingly grounded and subtle, yet anticipatory, foreboding and at times even pastoral and Arcadian. The sound of a magical chamber orchestra or C√¶sar Legions? Well, Mirror Emperor does echo pivotal moments from the respective catalogues of its creators, most urgently akin to Zu‚Äôs acoustic explorations on their 2014 collaboration with Eugene S. Robinson of Oxbow fame, The Left Hand Path, leading up to last year‚Äôs brilliantly metamorphic Jhator. For others the album will come as a gift from the blazing starres, more than hinting at a stripped down Current 93 of the 90s, perhaps in the same way as 2010‚Äôs Baalstorm, Sing Omega or Myrninerest‚Äôs 2012 album, ‚ÄòJhonn,‚Äô Uttered Babylon at times did.\n‚ÄúThe album is the closing of a long circle for me,‚Äù comments Massimo Pupillo. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been following David‚Äôs work since the early days and count Current 93 as one of the main inspirations behind my work with Zu. For me his poetry and music is like a light in the depths of human experience, a soundtrack for one‚Äôs personal descent into the unconscious fields.‚Äù ‚ÄúZu made something very beautiful and very powerful for me to skip into. I love this album,‚Äù Tibet says. Mirror Emperor adds another chapter in his ever-expanding oblique vision: personal, dense and hallucinatory. A voice through a cloud, indeed. On Mirror Emperor, the demiurge of our demise hides in the cracks of a broken world, beneath stones and moss, among the comets, in tears and things and on BloodBoats, as if a ‚Äúcosmic melancholy‚Äù (Ligotti) is being articulated. More mourning than light. Tibet explains:\nWe all carry different faces, different masks, and all of them will be taken from us. We were born free, and fell through the Mirror into a UnWorld, a Mirror Empire. In this Mirror Empire we are under the Mirror Emperor, and there are MANY Bad Moons Rising. At the final curtain there is scant applause.\nAs the music fades out, we hear a whispered ‚Äúawake‚Äù. ‚ÄúEvery time I heard this final call to awakening while working on the album, I found myself deeply moved,‚Äù Pupillo says. ‚ÄúAwake. If this was the last word to come out of Zu, I would be a happy man.‚Äù\nWhat we‚Äôre left with is a dreamlike suite, created under a murderous moon. Perhaps that is all we ever hoped for. Hey, was that the Apocalypse?\nZu93 is: David Tibet, Massimo Pupillo, Stefano Pilia, Luca Mai, Luca Tilli, Andrea Serrapiglio, Sara D‚ÄôUva.\n‚Äì Tore Engelsen Espedal, March 2018\n*Quoted from Thomas Ligotti‚Äôs ‚ÄúWill You Wait For Me By the Dead Clock?‚Äù, the afterword in David Tibet‚Äôs collection of lyrics Sing Omega (Spheres, 2015)",

            "about": "Stubbornly free from genre classification, Italian trio Zu have been proud to follow their own musical pathways for some twenty years now. Throughout their highly diverse career the band has cultivated the art of collaboration, joining forces with luminaries such as Mike Patton, Damo Suzuki, Mats Gustafsson and Nobukazu Takemura. Their new album ‚Äì and first on House of Mythology ‚Äì is no exception, featuring guest musicians such as Jessica Moss of Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra and Kristoffer Lo of Norwegian pop sensations Highasakite, among others.\nJhator is perhaps their most ethereal venture yet, and a bold new trajectory for musicians and label alike ‚Äì a pensive, mind-expanding foray into abstraction and wonder, rich in cinematic ambience and transcendent, transformational power. Consisting of two extended pieces, this is a work that connects Zu to their antecedents both spiritual and musical, whilst forging forward in the manner of no-one but themselves.\nThe album takes its starting point inspiration-wise from an ancient Tibetan funeral practice, the sky burial. With this in mind, the two lengthy tracks herein chronicle a journey from the earthly to the sacred realm. The band themselves clarify their position thus: ‚ÄúIn making this album we have tried to affirm life, beauty and mystery. We refocus the vision in another direction, far from the Western point of view.‚Äù True to this approach, this album‚Äôs journey is a psychotropic mission through trance states and transcendence, with the soul taking flight in the sweeping soundscapes and otherworldly ambience evoked by this unique act.\nIt is certainly possible to hear the echoes of Coil in the sonic experimentation and transgressive approach of these two pieces; the band have also taken to heart some of the central precepts of one of that outfit‚Äôs creative minds, Peter Christopherson, which runs thus: ‚ÄúAs long as I can remember, I‚Äôve approached music from a visual point of view. Any technique that you can apply to a film, you can also apply to a piece of music.‚Äù Moreover, some of these slips into the ether could be compared to the fanciful flights of expression that Pink Floyd undertook around their epiphanies at Pompeii, but this is perhaps more to do with the general aura and panoramic reveries that occurred visually in tandem with the ‚Äô71 concert-film.\nAbove and beyond any creative footing found in a rock music lineage, this is also an album inspired by the ancient Egyptian texts discussed in Susan Brind Morrow‚Äôs The Dawning Moon of the Mind and the Sufi poetry of Farid ud-Din Attar. On Jhator Zu traverse beyond everyday concerns to reflect a broader existential life that unites the primal and the metaphysical, relaying a series of vivid audial atmospheres with immense scope and luminous intensity. There may be few bands we‚Äôd trust with such matter of life and death, but on the evidence of this record Zu stand beyond compare, a visionary force whose horizons seem ever-expanding.\n‚Äì Jimmy Martin",

            "about": "You might see it in the stars or the root of a tree. It can be the flickering fluorescent light in the corner of a room or dew settling on a leaf in the early morning hours.\nIt is overwhelming, yet barely there.\nTerminalia Amazonia, the new, subdued and momentous instalment of Zu, is the sound of a long, slow journey in pursuit of a moment. For the past four years the band‚Äôs members have regularly visited an undisclosed indigenous village on the Ucayali River close to the border between Peru and Brazil. They‚Äôve immersed themselves in the local Shipibo-Conibo culture‚Äôs ancient knowledge, teachings and rituals, some of which stretch back millennia.\n‚ÄúWhat you hear on Terminalia Amazonia is the integration of worlds: the ancient shamanic songs of the Shipibo-Conibo tradition and our own search for sound and frequencies,‚Äù says Massimo Pupillo. The heart of the Shipibo-Conibo culture is rooted in their spiritual, physical, and cultural relationship to the Amazonian rainforest, and Zu‚Äôs work started as a series of nightly field recordings of the culture‚Äôs ceremonial healing songs, known as Icaros.\nFive minutes into this 72-minute album, the listener will sense, intuitively, where it is coming from. Its tone and pace are those of human breath, vital, vulnerable, slowly revealing a lush, humid space that is sacred to the few who have journeyed there.\nPlaying only vintage analogue synthesizers (EMS Synthi, OSCar, Roland System-100M, ARP 2600, Octave-Plateau Voyetra-8), Zu project dense, spectral layers of sound through damp rainforest atmosphere, weaving through sheltered gulleys and out into open glades, mottled with streaks of scattered light. Spontaneous and elaborate, grounded and transformative, the sound conveys its shamanic intent, so immersing the listeners in the present moment that their surroundings will melt away.\n‚ÄúIn the Amazonian tradition nature and man are not separated,‚Äù Pupillo says when describing the ceremonies they attended. ‚ÄúThe Shipibo medicine men address the Noya Rao, a master plant. It is a tree considered a true teacher, and they sing their devotional songs to the powers of this and other plants, of the earth and of the stars. For them, the chants create a connection with a world beyond the visible one, a world of spirits.‚Äù\nAs I listen, I can‚Äôt help but to think of the threats that the Shipibo and their ancestral territories are now facing: the extensive fields of ash and cinders, eating their way into the green-leafed world. The advancing deforestation, oil spills and contamination of their rivers and waterways.\nThe Inca Empire never conquered the Shipibo and they resisted colonization by the Spanish priests who appeared in the rainforest over four centuries ago. But the forces of global economy have left the villages on the Ucayali River more vulnerable than ever before. In this, Terminalia Amazonia hides a secret sadness.\nStill, Pupillo emphasizes that this is not an anthropological, ethnographical, or even a political project. First and foremost, Terminalia Amazonia presents a personal story of descent and ascent, the burden of dreams and the need for new discoveries: ‚Äúit contains a subjective narrative, shaped within our own Western, Mediterranean consciousness. There has been enough appropriation and exploitation of Shipibo culture by outsiders and we don't want to add to that. We don't want to wear another people's clothes. The band is Italian and our psyche is and will always be rooted in Mediterranean mythology. The descent and the way back to the surface will for us always be connected to Demeter and Persephone, the Eleusinian mysteries that shaped the form known as tragedy,‚Äù he says.\nTragos, the goat, will always be at the door.\nBy entering this ancient space, Zu have found a place to mourn the past and nurture the ability to welcome the change that inevitably accompanies the future. It took time for them to return, because to be lost is also to be fully present, and to be comfortable living with uncertainty and mystery. ‚ÄúThis is music made by four people who grew up together and have stood next to each other for what is now a lifetime,‚Äù says Pupillo. ‚ÄúIt is the result of a deeper connection, going beyond our experiences as a band. In a sense it is about survival.‚Äù Yes, perhaps that is what Terminalia Amazonia is all about.\nIt is overwhelming, yet barely there.\nTore Engelsen Espedal, June 2019\nThis project is released in cooperation with Archaeological Records  (www.archaeologicalrecords.org),  with conceptual development and support from Andrea Stillacci of Herezie and Giulio Di Mauro of AR.",
