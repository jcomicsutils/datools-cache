            "about": "“The Net is a metaphysical space\nthat mimics our metaphysical\nexperience of the dead as being\nneither here nor there but somehow\neverywhere yet nowhere in particular”\n(Gibson, 2007).\n\"everywhere yet nowhere in particular\" explores instances of digital ghosts, infomorphs, and objects left online by people who have died. Originally presented as a sound installation comprised of three video collages and one sound collage which stitched together the remaining bits of these people / infomorphs. This album documents in the sound of the space as well as the five parts to the sound collage.\nExhibited in the WaveCave from 4/26 - 5/2.\nWhere do we stop? Where are our edges?\nproject:  wavecave.calarts.edu/2016/thomas-sturm-everywhere-yet-nowhere-particular/\nvideo:  www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANBwuj5NHgU\ncontact:  www.facebook.com/thomassturm/?fref=ts",

            "about": "“Music for The” is an album of music for my homemade instrument, The. It is dedicated to the memory of Carol and Richard Wakeham.\nAfter Richard passed away in 2017, I realized that I had no recordings of his voice. I adored our conversations, and losing that memory was devastating. I attempted to replace it by going back through the years of field recordings I had made to transport myself back to moments during the six years I knew him. This inspired me to be more vigilant about capturing and organizing recordings that were important to me. Using his old woodshop, I built an instrument to re-animate my memories. I called it The, a nickname he had given himself.\nThese pieces were created between the spring of 2018 and the summer of 2019. Each one is a re-synthesis of an experience tied to the years I knew him. Following his wife Carol's passing earlier this month, I set up The in their home and recorded this album. Thank you for listening.\nTo Richard and Carol, I love you both so much.\nCassiopeia Sturm, the\nRecorded at Richard and Carol's house in September 2019.\nFor more information about The please check out  cassiopeiasturm.com/the",

                    "about": "\"A Singing Comet\" is a continuation of my work with transcribing sounds recorded in space for various acoustic ensembles. This piece began as an experiment in transcription of the sound emitted by the Comet 67p and recorded by Rosetta’s Plasma Consortium. After a complete transcription, I began to make musical interventions in the material, adding my own textures and musical contexts for the sound of the comet to travel through. In this way, \"A Singing Comet\" serves as a representation both of the actual sound of the comet, and the metaphoric representation of its travel through space and its interaction with the Human Race.\nRecorded on 3/15/15 by the Little Giant Ensemble during Rice University's Common Practice 21C: Classical, Contemporary, and Cross-Cultural Music Festival highlighting a variety of Chinese Instruments and contemporary compositions composed for Both Chinese and Western Classical ensembles.",

The sounds were then electronically altered and organized. The second layer involves live recordings from the audience members experiencing the installation. The sounds they made were picked up by a microphone, electronically altered through Max/MSP and sent to two speakers (along with the pre-recorded fixed-media) in real time. Hope you enjoy!",

The percussion set up is comprised of my homemade take on Xenakis' Sixxen, Thunder Sheet, and four triangles. The electronic accompaniment was generated using Spear and MAX/MSP. My inspiration for this piece came from two different sources. First, from my experiments with micro-tones and construction of instruments that create complex pitches. And second, from my preoccupation with the cosmos. During one of my many star-gazing experiences, I decided to re-imagine the stars and constellations in the night sky as being note heads on a cosmological piece of staff paper. This piece serves a representation of my own meditations under the stars.",

Even if they are both perceived by different facilities in the human body, they exist as waves. This “hidden” similarity inspired me to create a method of uniting the two. The piece is composed for two bug zappers. These light instruments serve as the physical manifestation of this uniting. I extract the light and sounds created by these two machines and physically manipulate them using Max/MSP and a Projector. These two distinct waves are then recombined into different textures, densities, and intensities, immersing the audience in the lights and sounds of electric waves.",

                    "about": "The Dwindling is the first installment of a series of pieces on the subject of dying. Although not discussed in our culture, how we die is extremely important. Unfortunately, because of social stigmas surrounding frank conversations on death, these end of life topics tend to go unspoken. This series is designed to create a space for people to practice dying and for meditation on the end of life.\nThis particular piece focuses on the most common type of death in the modern western world: hospitalized death at the late stages of life surrounded by medical professionals and health technology. This piece explore this type of death by simulating the experience. The performer takes on the role of the medical professional and the computer the dying body. At the start of the work, the computer uses AI to generate original music. As the computer begins to get \"sick\", the performer steps in and, using a leap motion controller, attempts to save the machine while stripping it of its autonomy. Overtime the computer's \"organs\" begin to fail one by one, culminating in a section of palliative care music. It is my hope that, by demonstrating this type of death, I will encourage people to think on the ways one can go, and whether this most common death is the best way.\nPremiered on 4/14/15 in the Turrell Skyspace \"Twilight Epiphany\" at Rice University in Houston, TX. Sounds created using Max/MSP and a Leapmotion Controller.",

            "about": "A meeting of two pillars of Los Angeles’ exploratory underground, The Invention of the Saxophone pairs Shiroishi’s tenor saxophone with Sturm’s self-built bionic Saxafone.\nCassiopeia Sturm (b. 1992) is a composer and musician who builds absurd, speculative instruments. Her work explores how instrument design can not only convey unique creative use but also be a platform for social critique and self-exploration. Many of her creations make use of unconventional interfaces that challenge cultural norms and ask participants to confront their expectations about design and musicianship. Sturm uses algorithmic processes, chaotic acoustics, and cybernetic circuitry to imbue her inventions with a sort of autonomy that blurs the line between creator, performer, and instrument. Through these methods, she plays with the expectations of what an instrument is and its relationship to both performer and composer.\nPatrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in Los Angeles who is perhaps best known for his extensive and incredibly intense work with the saxophone. Over the last decade he has established himself as one of the premier improvising musicians in Los Angeles, playing solo and in numerous collaborative projects. Shiroishi may well be considered a foundational player in the city's vast musical expanse.",
