            "about": "The eleventh entry in Trouble In Mind's Explorers Series pushes forward with a dazzling duo exchange from Buenos Aires-born, Stockholm-based saxophone player, composer, improviser, multidisciplinary artist and activist Camila Nebbia & Los Angeles saxophone player & multi-instrumentalist Patrick Shiroishi. Utilizing two saxophones, electronics and ambient/found sounds,\"The Human Being As A Fragile Article\" is an intuitive and expressive conversation between two prolific vanguards of brass; at times minimal and purposeful, and other times explosive and lyrical, exploring the physical, mental and emotional layers within the brittle facade of the human shell.\nwww.camilanebbia.com\nwww.patrickshiroishi.com",

            "about": "From the opening swells of this striking debut recording, one can sense that there is deep listening taking place among this trio’s members. Entirely improvised in the afternoon of their first meeting, Speak, Moment cascades from gorgeous mountaintop revelation fanfare to rough hewn and ragged noise. Altogether, it is an opening salvo, a profound and unrepeatable moment in the lives of these three remarkable musicians. Dave Harrington, Max Jaffe, and Patrick Shiroishi have bewilderingly stacked CVs and accolades from here to the moon. Together, on Speak, Moment, they establish hypnotic and richly textured guitar-driven tapestries colored with the effervescent thread of a yearning saxophone melody that might be torn loose in an instant by thunderous percussion or febrile grooves.",

            "about": "A meeting of two pillars of Los Angeles’ exploratory underground, The Invention of the Saxophone pairs Shiroishi’s tenor saxophone with Sturm’s self-built bionic Saxafone.\nCassiopeia Sturm (b. 1992) is a composer and musician who builds absurd, speculative instruments. Her work explores how instrument design can not only convey unique creative use but also be a platform for social critique and self-exploration. Many of her creations make use of unconventional interfaces that challenge cultural norms and ask participants to confront their expectations about design and musicianship. Sturm uses algorithmic processes, chaotic acoustics, and cybernetic circuitry to imbue her inventions with a sort of autonomy that blurs the line between creator, performer, and instrument. Through these methods, she plays with the expectations of what an instrument is and its relationship to both performer and composer.\nPatrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in Los Angeles who is perhaps best known for his extensive and incredibly intense work with the saxophone. Over the last decade he has established himself as one of the premier improvising musicians in Los Angeles, playing solo and in numerous collaborative projects. Shiroishi may well be considered a foundational player in the city's vast musical expanse.",

            "about": "in december i had the privilege to perform a piece written for me by Radu Malfatti, a man who is unmistakable in his journey and exploration in music, in celebration for Andrew Choate's Learning release party. reductionism was something i was not too familiar with prior to encountering the piece so i took some time to look into Radu's thought process on music and what he wants to achieve.\nas i did my benkyou, or homework, his philosophy was really eye opening for me... an approach that was very japanese to me. he wasn't thinking of filling all of the space or \"what else can i do next,\" but more of listening to the other sounds for the duration of the piece, that there shouldn't be a need to feel like something is missing but more of an opportunity to be listening to other sounds.\nperforming the piece took much more focus that i anticipated. for the first few tones i felt anxious, that time was dragging on extremely slowly. i tried focusing on my own breathing and how to prepare for the next event of sound. i took careful attention to the duration of silence before and after every event, making sure not to gasp for air or make any additional sounds. a breaking point came about halfway through the piece, where i feel like i was able to do exactly what Malfatti as i interpreted was hoping for.\nthis recording was done prior to the performance of the piece. after weeks of preparation and listening to recordings of Radu, i sent this to him to make sure that i was on the right track. my hopes are to eventually record a studio version of this, but for now, i present to you my homework.",

            "about": "Originally released via A Red Thread in February 2023. All proceeds went to the Monterey Park Community Healing Fund  (calfund.org/monterey-park-community-healing-fund).  From Patrick:\nyou never expect disasters to take place where you grew up, let alone one of the worst mass shootings to ever happen in California.\nsince the murders took place, the community has mourned. i caught up with friends from middle school and high school, everyone at one point or another mentioning the same thing, \"we can't believe it took place so close to home.\" although i don't live in Monterey Park anymore, I still drive down Garfield where the shooting took place as it is a 5 minute drive from my auntie's house. i've driven down that street more than 10 times since the shooting but still can't bring myself to visit the dance studio...\nthe music presented here isn't something that was a response to the shooting, but Dustin and I have talked at length about what had happened as well as the anti-asian hate crimes that have peaked in the current years. i am glad i have him by my side.\nbeing a musician i often feel powerless in situations like this, but i hope we can give anyone who listens to this some sort of understanding and comfort.\ndedicated to Mymy Nhan, Xiujuan Yu, Hongying Jian, Yu Lun Kao, Valentino Marcos Alvero, Wen Tau Yu, Ming Wei Ma, Diana Man Ling Tom, Muoi Dai Ung, Chia Ling Yau & Lilan Li",

            "about": "Patrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in Los Angeles who is perhaps best known for his extensive and incredibly intense work with the saxophone. Over the last decade he has established himself as one of the premier improvising musicians in Los Angeles, playing solo and in numerous collaborative projects. Shiroishi may well be considered a foundational player in the city’s vast musical expanse. He has presented work and performed at the Museum of Contemporary Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the International Museum of Surgical Sciences and has toured around the world in various solo and band configurations including The Armed, contemporary classical ensemble Wild Up and Upsilon Acrux.",

            "about": "There is something special about this moment in time. As the world continues to burn and crumble around us, I am in awe of watching people whom I know, old and new, create music and art that speaks of love, loss, giving, and grief. Across Water represents much more than a few compositions split between two of this generation’s greatest thinkers, but four big hugs from members of my own family.\nJessica Ackerley (Honolulu, Hawaii) and Patrick Shiroishi (Los Angeles, California) are household names (at least in my expansive circle) at this point. Both are members of the newly announced super-family-group SSWAN (along with trumpeter Chris Williams, drummer Jason Nazary, and bassist Luke Stewart). Both have prolific outputs and work diligently to push the boundaries of their respective instruments and previous musical ideas.\nJessica contributes to this collection with “I Am Here” and “The Crevices Between My Heart”. Perhaps my bias overrunneth, but their time in HI. has clearly influenced the tones, tender structuring, and pacing of these musical demonstrations. With the influence of the water present, both pieces breathe deeply of someone who has reflected much on their relationship with not only sound, but the environment. In particular, the guitar and synth work on the second composition gives way to visuals of deep-sea life that can only sustain itself away from the hustle and bustle of crowdedness.\nHaving sat in on a recent recording session with Jessica, I can speak to their dedication to all things seen, and not, in terms of organismic relatability.\nSimilarly, Patrick is no stranger to straddling the fine lines between subtle and overt emotionality. “Because You Went There” and “Leaving It All Behind” are his lendings to this album, and while Jessica’s pieces, whether intentional or not, represent the watery side of the spirit, Patrick’s contributions look to the sky. The sweet and smoggy California air seems to inspire the multi-instrumentalist to hover above the LA streets and observe what the typically land-grounded mortal cannot.\nI’ve written about Patrick Shiroishi several times over the years, and his earnest approach using sound to connect with every single being he encounters constantly leaves me in a state of hopefulness.\nSure, these are my people. But, Across Water is my people making music for all people. And like every project that passes, I’m so glad to have learned more about those people… and ultimately myself in the process.\nGabriel Jermaine Vanlandingham-Dunn\ncow: Music/ Astral Spirits Records\n(2022, Brooklyn, NY)",

Patrick Shiroishi is one of the key artists to emerge from the current L.A. free improvisation avant-underground; his first vinyl release is a spiritual journey that reveals his deeply reflective and unique musical vision. Descension is a sonic meditation on the legacy of a dark history and its echoing relevance in the present era.",

            "about": "Effectively a suite of improvised duets for soprano saxophone that recalls both the leviathan cistern meditations of Pauline Oliveros’ Deep Listening Band and Catherine Christer Hennix’s extended raga drones, these pieces were recorded during the early days of the pandemic in an underground tunnel located beneath a shuttered hot pot restaurant.\n‘Empty Vessels’ stands apart as a remarkable document of almost architectural sound, in a sense, with the natural reverb of the tunnel asserting itself as a third player in the ensemble. Indeed, the natural acoustics of the space evoke a palpable sense of isolation and uneasiness. Fragments of melody, wails, and strained breaths dissolve into extended silences, erasing themselves in real time before being built back up into towering columns of resonance.\nIt’s odd to think that this music was effectively enabled by the pandemic. Without California’s extended lockdown, there likely would have been people coming in and out of the area, not to mention street noise seeping into the recording. While the reverberations of Patrick and Marta’s performance have long since dissipated and the tunnel has returned to silence, what remains is music that longs to be underground – ever seeking, digging deeper still into the shadows.",

            "about": "A vivid late night live session from 4 of modern improvised music's sharpest and most expressive spirits - recorded January, 2023.\nIn the fragmented poems of Sappho, Eros is abstruse and elusive - the closer we seem to come, the more unknowable the idea becomes. As the poems break off, Eros resists surveillance and direct apprehension - the fragment an invitation and dissolution into wonder. It is in a similar nebulous space that the quartet of Alex Cunningham, Patrick Shiroishi, Jessica Ackerley and Damon Smith gambol in undefined possibilities outside of the logic of continuity. In flight from the static pins of intelligibility, the quartet here flutter like wild moths refusing to be tacked to lifeless observational taxonomies. Across four pieces of suspended midnight vividness the music here is like Eros in the works of Sappho both exploring space and silence and shaking the mind like ‘mountain wind falling on the oak trees.'",

Alto saxophone, chaotic electronics and some amplified household objects interweave and echo across a broad, deep soundscape, the mood ranging from confrontational and disorientating to soulful and lyrical. The combination of free improvisation and compositional collage facilitates a balance between unpredictability and narrative clarity.",

            "about": "Forgetting is Violent, Patrick Shiroishi’s latest solo LP, is his most immediate release yet, expanding the scope not just of his music but of his extramusical considerations. Where his past releases on American Dreams reckoned with racism against Japanese Americans or presented Shiroishi’s saxophone as heard in a parking garage, Forgetting is Violent considers racism as a whole, historical and ongoing, with the urgency it deserves. Here, for the first time, we hear Shiroishi joined by a supporting cast that reads like a who’s-who of heavy music: Aaron Turner (SUMAC, ISIS), Gemma Thompson (Savages), Faith Coloccia (Mamiffer), otay::onii (Elizabeth Colour Wheel), and Mat Ball (BIG|BRAVE). The constant, as ever, is Shiroishi's patient, probing musicality, marrying heaviness and lightness, acceptance and defiance, both packing a punch and welcoming new listeners into the fold.\n“I’m always interested in pushing the horn,” Shiroishi says. “You’re not gonna sound sweeter than Paul Desmond. You’re not gonna write crazier melodies and harmonies than Ornette. So I'm trying to figure out: what can I do different, while being me, and expressing what I’ve gone through?” Even though Shiroishi began writing the music on Forgetting is Violent years ago, while supporting Godspeed You! Black Emperor on tour, his honed craft is apparent on record. On his 2023 tour supporting Emma Ruth Rundle, which brought his powerful live sets to a larger audience, he built on his signature sound, using effects pedals to loop, freeze and distort notes with his saxophone. Most of all, the music comes from his lived experience and the desire to reach others with it. The effects pedals, the field recordings, the arrangements—Shiroishi says, “they're all tools to convey a message.”\nIt follows, then, that Forgetting is Violent is his first album to feature guests. “I think it stems from my love for collaboration,” he says. “I’ve been a part of a lot of ensembles, a lot of different free improvised stuff. And a lot of that playing is where I gain new insight into what I can develop further in my solo practice.” Between his work as a solo artist, work with The Armed, collaborative releases, and guest appearances, Shiroishi’s discography is as dizzying as it is diverse, including work with—among countless others—Chelsea Wolfe, Algiers, Xiu Xiu, Dirty Projectors, Che Chen and claire rousay. On Forgetting is Violent, we hear coruscating guitars, layered vocal harmonies and daubs of electronics along Shiroishi’s saxophone—even his voice. Turner wields a massive guitar on the album’s first three songs. Thompson joins on guitar on “Mountains that take wing,” and Coloccia’s electronics & voice undergird “…what does anyone want but to feel a little more free?”. Whether soft or raucous, spacious or dense, Shiroishi provides the fire, his collaborators the ice.\nShiroishi’s message on Forgetting is Violent comprises two suites. The first meditates on racism and colonialism from history to the present day. “Mountains that take wing” introduces the first theme of the album, a gentle repetition for saxophone anchored around middle C. While Thompson and Turner’s guitars approach but never quite reach consonance, Shiroishi adds more saxophone. The music spirals. Eventually one hears him, as if from a distance, singing slowly in Japanese. On “…what does anyone want but to feel a little more free?,” Shiroishi’s aunt, an antiracist advocate, speaks to her first experience of racism. The suite recalls the Japanese concept of gaman, or enduring the unendurable. Here, in music and words, are the tensions inherent to racism, part of living in a society that—whether through small gestures of disconnect, forced deportation or concentration camps—wants to make you extinct. “Stemming back to my ancestors, and the stolen land that we live on—there’s just so much of this racism that is so alive and well, and so apparent, and continues to be apparent in our country and around the world,” Shiroishi says. “Something that cannot be forgotten.”\nShiroishi wrote the second suite, which comprises side B, for a family member who died of an overdose. “It’s grappling with what I imagined he would have felt leaving this earth, leaving behind kids—and now being in the sky and watching over them.” These tracks mostly feature Shiroishi solo, singing a simple wordless melody over a soft synthetic drone. But on closing track “Trying to get to heaven before they close the door,” he harmonizes with himself, arranging the melody as if for a choir. Meanwhile, Ball's guitar exhumes great clouds of static, mixing with Shiroishi’s vocal harmonies and caterwauling saxophone. Here, in miniature, is the simultaneous potency of grief and its aftershocks, the sacred and profane.\n“That act of sharing and bringing it up, even though it’s difficult,” Shiroishi says, “it makes us feel like we’re not alone. And I think that’s important, especially in a time where it’s just so fucking grim, that we can support each other and be together, that there is hope in the future….” As time passes and genocide looms, Shiroishi’s music—insistent, liquid, organic—is but one source of hope.\nFeaturing liner notes by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Hua Hsu, Forgetting is Violent is released in companion with the third edition of Tangled: a publication collecting stories, poems and essays by Asian-American musicians, including Anne Ishii, Yuka Honda, Satomi Matsuzaki and Kazu Makino.",

            "about": "The work of the Danketsu group - formerly 9, now 10 - has always revolved around ideas of unity, inclusion and equality. Their latest, completely improvised album titled From a distance, everything shines embodies these ideals; in the subtlety of each contribution, the gentleness of each performer, the willingness to contribute to something greater than each member on their own. The music here is largely graceful, sublime, almost peaceful, and even the more harrowing moments dissolve into a conclusion that's uplifting. The title of the track “ชั่วเจ็ดทีดีเจ็ดหน” is a Thai Buddhist proverb which translates to “Bad seven times, good seven times”. Patrick Shiroishi, the leader of the group, explains that to him this means that “there is something good even in a bad situation.”\n'From a distance, everything shines' is the third release of the Danketsu group. As Danketsu 9, they released albums on Never Anything Records and Patient Sounds. This album is their first as Danketsu 10.",

            "about": "the first time i saw or heard the suona was with Vinny several years ago, well before we recorded Borasisi. if you know or have seen Vinnt play, it;s just one of the 100s of different instruments he has. i made a mental note to ask him what that was, but when i went up to talk to him later i completely forgot and we started to shoot the shit about something else, probably about getting a better case for my bari that had wheels on it.\na few years later i finally visited Paul in Taipei. a week before i came to visit he was telling me about a parade of musicians that went down the street and how awesome and fucking loud they were. he found a clip and we started investigating what instruments they were playing. lo and behold, one of them was the suona. when i touched down, we made a trip to go pick one up...i even tried to use it at a show we had the next day.\ni started bringing the instrument with me to shows and collaborations (i try my very hardest in the opening minutes of Danketsu 10) and eventually grew a real love for it. it had so many sides that i would stumble on by accident here and there...this recording is, more or less, a study on all of those sides. i hope to continue my relationship with the instrument in the years to come.",

Combining a variety of genres and elements, the track is marked by a playful and trusting exploration among the four musicians. Drawing inspiration from ECM, cool jazz, ambient music, minimalism, city pop, post-rock, folk, and Americana, this music thoughtfully roams across landscapes like a wandering cloud.\nFuubutsushi is a quartet featuring Chris Jusell, Chaz Prymek, Matthew Sage, and Patrick Shiroishi. The group creates their recordings by collaborating remotely, with all four members living in different states. They formed their group at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and completed a four album series based on the seasons from 2020–21.",

            "about": "This 73-minute album captures a sextet session at HelMel Studios, on Melrose Avenue, Los Angeles, last February.\nThe group consists of four sax players: Vinny Golia, Patrick Shiroishi, Catherine Sikora, and Stanley Jason Zappa, joined by pianist Andrew Wedman and drummer Nick Skrowaczewski. The nine tracks showcase various combinations of players, including an opening piano and drum duo, Sikora solo, a sax trio, and various horn / piano / drums combos, culminating in the fiery all-hands-on-deck closer.\n\"Long, wonderful session for four saxes, piano and percussion. Vinny Golia’s reeds have long been a guiding light of the Los Angeles free scene, and this sextet play great. The tracks were recorded by a variety of smaller units as well as ‘in bulk’, and there’s even a solo piece for Catherine Sikora’s sax. Some tracks have a mix of layering and individual voicings that reminds me of Anthony Braxton’s small groups of the 1970s and 80s, and the way these guys handle space is congruent with post-AACM musical thinking. It’s a hep and interesting tape, as well as proof that at least one of Frank Zappa’s nephews has solid musical conceptions.\" - Byron Coley, The Wire April 2023 (issue 470)",

            "about": "“The concentration camps that Japanese Americans had to go through has been a major part of my work for the last couple of years,” says Los Angeles based composer and saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi. His last album Descension was heavily focused on the experience inside Japanese-American concentration camps, but his new album Hidemi, a solo multilayered woodwind journey, is more on the personal experience of his grandfather after getting out. “His name is Hidemi Patrick,” Shiroishi explains, “so I was named after him, but I never got to meet him, as he passed away before I was born.” As Patrick’s name is in memory to his grandfather, Hidemi is too, and across the album’s nine tracks, Shiroishi brings the listener through tension and release, showcasing something unfiltered, beautiful, and ultimately hopeful, a testament to perseverance and grace.\nIf you’ve ever wondered what trios, quartets, and quintets of Patrick Shiroishi’s sounded like, Hidemi was made for you. All of the album was written and performed by Shiroishi who sang and played alto, baritone, tenor, C melody, and soprano saxophones, stacking up layers of harmonies often each recorded in one take. The album’s opening blasts on “Beachside Lonelyhearts” blow the doors open, but are quickly replaced by loping, interplaying melodies that swell, recede, then slowly, methodically shuffle off. Other songs like “To Kill A Wind-Up Bird” start with woodwind flurries and free jazz that metamorphosize into something serene before Shiroishi’s baritone sax, breaks open the piece, and brings back the beginning’s composed but frenetic energy.\nShiroishi wanted to allow for community expression, too, to be a part of Hidemi regarding the Asian-American experience, so he curated and edited a chapbook featuring writings and art by fellow Asian-American artists - Tangled. The book was made to provide a platform for thoughts considering the recent rise of violence against Asian-Americans due to racism spurred by misinformation on Covid-19, and features artists such as Dylan Fujioka, Mai Sugimoto, Tashi Dorji & Susie Ibarra.\nIn an evocative, personal essay from Tangled, Shiroishi explains the Japanese concept of “‘gaman,’ which means to endure the seemingly unbearable with patience and dignity, or simply put, to bite your tongue.” It’s a chilling, profound passage in which the history of Japanese-Americans have had to “gaman” with Shiroishi ultimately stating that “We can no longer ‘gaman.’ We must be loud and speak up, so what our grandparents and ancestors went through will not be forgotten or taken for granted.”\nHidemi functions as a warning, but there is ecstasy and hope in it, too. In the last song “The Long Bright Dark,” a short, blossoming tear-jerker that crescendos with Shiroishi’s vocals, the artist cries out in Japanese “Is This The End Of The Storm?” It’s the sole sung passage in Hidemi, but its effectiveness is chill-inducing - it contextualizes everything, pushing forward while acknowledging historical evil. It’s moving and impactful, moving towards a society where - in his essay he writes - “our children and future generations may live without fear. So that they won’t have to “gaman.”",

            "about": "High Life is like a mini-album, a short journey or guide. The perfect use of the 7\" format, showcasing the range of this inventive duo with each playing their core instruments of violin (Krausbauer) and saxophone (Shiroishi), along with some organ drones and singing.\nOn the a-side, Bird’s Song starts things off with John’s beautiful pulsing organ swells, while Patrick comes in blustering and quick with a cacophony of notes. The world is waking up. They then set off traversing the dynamic range of the free-improv landscape on the title track High Life, with sharp interplay between the droning and soaring violin and skipping free-sax melodies.\nOn the b-side, the trek continues with Swing Low, as John's grinding Conrad-esque violin drones lay a base for Patrick's track-long skronking sax solo. They finish off the trip, and the 7\", with the raga meditations of Tuning In & Turning On, all chanting voices and organ drone; the world lays its head down.",

            "about": "this record is very different for me, more private than public...\nit was created in march amidst the growing concern of covid-19 and the first week of quarantine, something that is now a regular part of our lives. as news of the virus spread early in the year, i felt very drained of my creative energy and hardly touched the saxophone. listening to music also started to feel stale...but it was in this rut that i came upon the fluxus movement that i've always heard about but never fully dove into. researching texts and recordings, i felt rejuvenated again and in that spirit came this record.\nthe foundations of the two pieces come from field recordings, heavy rainfall during that first quarantined weekend making the dread all the more heavy and sounds from being indoors at home. splashes of locations appear as a reminder of memories and times when we could freely move around and adventure whether it be in the country or around the world...",

            "about": "racism towards asian americans is nothing new.  my grandparents experienced it, my parents have experienced it, and i've experienced it.  growing up, my tendency when encountering it would be to shrug it off or make it into some kind of joke.  it wasn't until my late 20s that i realized that it wasn't something i could brush off any longer, not only racism towards myself but towards other people of color.\nsince then i've done my best in speaking out about injustice, primarily through music.  this often came about more through experiences that my family have went through, and typically from a very angry and pissed off space.  although i do have hope and my records end on (what i think) a positive note, when i hear about these acts of injustice especially violence i get very upset.\nwhat happened a week ago was something else.  instead of my usual getting riled up, i felt incredibly sad.  something just hit different and i couldn't shake it for several days. true to how i process things, i once again turned to music.  what you hear below are those feelings.  i asked Asa & Crystal to share their feelings as well and i am so honored and lucky they said yes.  Alice also created a flower arrangement the day after the events and graciously allowed me to use the photo as the cover.\npeople are starting to really speak up for the community and conversations are starting to be had...it's the beginning of a long road ahead.  i encourage everyone to do what you can, especially my asian brothers and sisters, even after the next news cycle takes over.  we must vocalize who we are and that we are indeed a part of this country.  we are not invisible and we need to unite.\nthis record is meant to be listened to in one sitting, please consider to digest it in that way. dedicated to daoyou feng, hyun jung grant, suncha kim, soon chung park, xiaojie tan, delaina ashley yaun, yong ae yue & paul andre michels. all proceeds will go towards their families via asian americans advancing justice - atlanta.",

            "about": "A single saxophone, a glockenspiel, two microphones, a zoom recorder. These are the materials Patrick Shiroishi brought down with him late one night into the cavernous parking structure below a hot pot restaurant in Monterey Park. It was around 1:30AM; the spot was not too far from where Shiroishi grew up, a blank slate shown to him by his dear friend, Noah Klein. A vacant space for a new kind of collaboration—between saxophone and silence, between noise and reverberation, between negative space and self.\nIn a single, improvised take, Shiroishi recorded his third solo LP, I was too young to hear silence. The record plays like a stripped-down ode to its star instrument. Solo saxophone dazzles and cascades through tangible air, each note hugged and trailed by a lush, natural reverb. Each silence, of which there are many, feels deliberate, sustained, honored.\nThere is an intentional arc to I was too young to hear silence. The first track, “stand still like a hummingbird,” opens with fourteen seconds of quiet before horn emerges, cautious and patient. Breathy, staccato punches of saxophone cut through the air, backdropped by audible gushes of running water. The sound of someone in the distance cleaning up at the end of a long night.\nIn describing the record, Shiroishi brings up Ma, the Japanese concept of negative space, or space in between. . Ma refers to the notion of negative space as a positive entity, rather than an absence of something else. The pauses between notes are not empty vacuums void of substance, but rather are full and present, valid contributions to a balanced composition. “The title [I was too young to hear silence] kind of refers to when I was younger…I would fill all the space with as many notes and as loud of volume as I could,” Shiroishi explains. “Not saying that there’s any wrong way to play, but for me, after a while, I was confused with what I was trying to say.” There is a confidence to silence, an assuredness to pausing. Silence leaves room for contemplation after each note. Nothing is hidden. “This is an honest record,” he says.\nThe next few tracks expand sonically, building gradually in volume and intensity. Shaky horn wails on “tule lake blues” reach higher and higher, moving through tones from low hearty sobs to impossibly high creaks, sustained in their yearning. Crescendos build generously before gifting the listener, once again, with a moment for reflection.\nIn preparing for the album, Shiroishi delved deeply into the world of Japanese free improvised, solo saxophone records. “There's this one I found by Masayoshi Urabe, he recorded this fifty-minute or hour-long solo saxophone thing. I downloaded it, and I was skipping through it to see what it was like, and every time I clicked, it was just nothing. It was silence. And I was like…did I download the wrong thing? And then, eventually, I had time to sit and listen to it. And that really opened things up.”\nIn “rain, after running away”, a twinkling minimal glockenspiel line emerges from the rest. The sound is refreshing, like drops of clear water. “I love the sound of the glockenspiel,” Patrick explains. Plus, “it's kind of easy to play with one hand while I'm playing the sax with the other.”\n“hunting the eye of his own storm,” the penultimate track, features five minutes of quick-moving, exuberant saxophone arpeggios, a breathless climax to the spacious arc of the album. “I like a payoff at the end of things. I love a slow burn, for better or for worse.” Shiroishi admits. “It's like, alright, thanks for bearing with me…here's the exclamation point.” ! This time, the bars of unending noise feel like a song of triumph. The exclamation continues into the final track, “if only heaven would give me another ten years.” Full, melodic horn lines overlap and dance until they reach their end, quieting down into nearly inaudible whispers, like distant echoes traveling through the night. No longer is Patrick Shiroishi too young to hear silence. And neither are we.\nI was too young to hear silence is released in companion with the second edition of Tangled. The publication, which collects stories, poems, and other forms of written word by Asian-American artists and musicians will be available alongside the record, out November 10th on American Dreams Records.",

Tracks one and four are (for the most part) \"mass\nprojections,\" marked by bombast, intensity, and a total disregard for\nanything approaching conventional melody or structure.\nPhysical copies available via Public Eyesore/Eh?",

            "about": "Technically the 4th installment of the \"No-No\" series of recordings by Dylan & Patrick. This one felt different, both sonically and emotionally. \"Left up on a Tree\" is inspired by all the people incarcerated in prison camps starting on this day 83 years ago, when Executive Order 9066 was signed. Our ancestors unnecessarily went through the loss of their homes, businesses, and livelihood so we could live the life we do today. After 4 years in camp, some left the country and others rebuilt what they had lost. Still, generations continue on. This music is extremely personal to us. We hope you take time and listen.",

            "about": "on this day, seventy nine years ago, FDR signed executive order 9066 that forced all japanese americans into concentration camps. Dylan and my grandparents were placed for years at Tule Lake, the largest and most controversial of sites. the government sent internees here whom they deemed \"disloyal,\" based on their refusal to go along meekly with the government's denial of their civil liberties, under heavy guard. politicians said that no japanese americans were forced to go and if they did, were provided with the best they could. the reality was that there were cracks in the walls where sand constantly blew in, shortages of food, milk, hot water and fuel to heat the barracks.\nwhen my grandparents were taken to the camps, all they were able to bring with them was one suitcase each. as a result, family heirlooms were lost. refrigerators were sold for $5. families who stored their belongings in neighbors' garages had nothing to return to, their items stolen by those who promised to take care of them. not only were these \"citizens\" robbed of their dignity and material objects that they worked so hard for, they returned to their communities only to start again from scratch.\nsimply put, discrimination led to unjust and awful treatment.\nand now today, in 2021, elderly asian americans are being attacked, robbed and killed. for walking down the block and \"bringing covid to america.\" i urge anyone who is reading and listening to this music, to speak up and denounce these violent acts, watch the documentary on asian americnas on pbs, talk to friends and families about what has and is happening and to reach out to federal and local agencies to work with communities to combat racism. because racism is still alive and well...\nall proceeds of this music will go towards Asian Americans Advancing Justice  (www.advancingjustice-aajc.org).  hope you stay safe and help others around you stay safe.",

            "about": "today is the 80th anniversary of the signing of executive order 9066, the order that authorized the imprisonment of japanese americans during the second world war.  last year, the second in a never ending year of masks, quarantine and fear, Dylan and I got together to respond to the surge of racist violence towards asian americans.  since then, many other individuals were attacked, some even brutally murdered....last week Christina Yuna Lee was brutally murdered in her home. last month a stranger pushed a woman, Michelle Alyssa Go, onto an oncoming R train in New York.  several news outlets didn't even mention her name, just a \"woman of asian descent.\"\ni fucking hated that.\nhowever, even with all of the negativity across the country, i have seen more and more people speaking up and having conversations about discrimination. i have seen people posting about what their families went through. i have seen people correct someone who says or spells their last name wrong. i have had strangers reach out to me about the camps...all of this gives me hope. hope that we are moving towards a better place in history.  with that being said, please do not stop checking in on your Asian friends. please continue to give space, support and courage to your Asian friends. center Asian women in your activism and in your stories. protect them.\nhere is a second offering from Dylan and myself on this day.\nlike the first recording, all proceeds of this music will go towards Asian Americans Advancing Justice  (www.advancingjustice-aajc.org).  we hope you will take time with this music and hear what we have to say.  stay safe and help others around you stay safe.",

            "about": "today is the 81st anniversary of the signing of executive order 9066, a day that I am still learning about. since Dylan and I first started releasing music on this day three years ago, i've been grateful to hear more stories of what Japanese Americans of my grandparent's generation have gone through...\ni've been pretty vocal about the camps for a while now. during the past year, i was unsure if it was my place to be so vocal about something i hadn't experienced myself...being a couple generations removed, maybe it was something for my father and aunt to talk about and not me.\nbut it is. they have both passed on stories about my grandparents to me and it is my place to continue telling them so that they are not forgotten. i've had the privilege to meet others who have the same feelings and express their thoughts and emotions through different mediums...being able to watch them dance, read their poems and books, and engage in discussion has been a great hope in my life. connecting with other Yonseis and sharing how we process this grief and experience life as grandchildren of the camps has made me feel not alone. it's been especially special to be making this music with Dylan as we go through this together, someone who i know i was connected to when we first met in high school but didn't think at this level. im proud to be continuing to release music in this series with him.\nlike the previous recordings, all proceeds of this music will go towards Asian Americans Advancing Justice  (www.advancingjustice-aajc.org).  we hope you will take time with this music and hear what we have to say as well as others across generations. stay safe and help others around you stay safe.",

            "about": "Now Am Found is the first collaboration between San Antonio’s Claire Rousay and Los Angeles jazz musician and experimental composer Patrick Shiroishi. Both artists are pleasantly surprised with how quickly it came together - after having known each other for many years, and having planned to collaborate for much of it, when they got down to brass tax, the collection only took about a month to complete.\nRousay likens the album’s ethos to “music playing in the other room,” which tracks, since the melodic content does feel spatially removed, on top of gentle environmental sounds. Whether it’s strummed jazz chords like on “I Remember What It Was Like,” gentle synths a la “Last of Many Times Over,” or the soft singing from “Silent Moon,” Now Am Found places the listener in a cocoon-like space where the mundane, the sacred, and the cherished become one and the same.",

            "about": "Patrick and I first played together in the fall of 2020, when he was visiting New York from LA. It was under a bridge in Greenpoint, with me on double bass and him on alto. We both brought our zoom recorders but neglected to turn them on, which has been a source of mild consternation ever since. A year later he was back and we set up some mics in 75 Dollar Bill's basement practice space in Ridgewood, and remembered to hit record this time. We added some other horns, percussion and a 1/4\" reel to reel machine with a loop in it to our battery of instruments and spent the afternoon recording. The files sat on my hard drive for another year, but when our friend Tashi Dorji invited us to Asheville for his edition of the Catalytic Sound Festival, we couldn't resist setting up a short tour down and back, and making this tape for the occasion. While that day under the bridge was definitively (A)LIVE--it was the first time I'd made music with another human being in person in the six or seven months since the pandemic started--the music on this tape is, like its cover, a collage, a sort of compacted multiverse of ourselves and our doubles, layered, spliced and dubbed over one another. We're on tour now, and it's more like it was under the bridge again, chasing the present every night, and feeling lucky to be able to do so. -CC, Durham, North Carolina",

            "about": "“They're two distinct types of visionaries, it's like fire and ice, basically…” - Spinal Tap\nIn May 2021, Jeff Tobias traveled to Los Angeles to see friends and get into nature. While there, he met up with Patrick Shiroishi for a first meeting improvisation that saw both multi-instrumentalists exclusively playing sopranino saxophone, the high-pitched instrument made famous by Maurice Ravel’s Boléro.\nNick Tuttle engineered the session, with assistance from Jerry Chinatown. In order to accentuate the registral extremes offered by the paired sopraninos, Tuttle recorded Shiroishi and Tobias in both the largest and smallest spaces available in his studio. The recording was consequently mastered by Ian Wayne; the results speak for themselves. The pair intend to record a follow-up sometime in the year of our Lord two thousand and twenty-two.",

            "about": "The season has changed. Chris Jusell, Chaz Prymek, Matthew Sage, and Patrick Shiroishi continue forward with what follows 2020’s Fuubutsushi. Here, it is a new year, and it is time to shake the demons off and make a fresh start. Setsubun is the Winter chapter in the cycle (yes, Spring and Summer will come one day), but don’t conflate this “winter music” with the holidays; this is music for the stretch between January and the first peals of spring. The days in this chasm that may be getting longer, however slowly, but the nights are still long. The air is crisp. The natural world lays dormant, but the imagination flutters.\nThese four players have learned more about each other since the amber nostalgia of Fuubutsushi and here they are more comfortable taking risks, ramping up, and pulling back. Prymek’s guitar and bass lines offer a fundamental structure on many of the tunes, in his distinct style that is both uniquely folky but patiently soulful. He more often opts for electric guitar, slide, shimmering fingerpicking, and those touches feel like frost in an empty tree canopy. Shiroishi’s crystalline voice sets a tone on the first track, but from there, he spends his time painting scenes with his saxophones and clarinet. The departure from his more oblique solo works into harmonious melody in this combination showcases the incredible range and skill he possesses over his instruments. He is your breath on the air. Sage shifts from piano onto rhodes for this album, where he continues to split the difference between ambient minimalism and cool jazz vamping. His drumming takes a new presence here, with more pronounced rhythms, deceptive stutters, playful push and pull dynamics. He is the ice under your feet. Sometimes you almost have to catch yourself from slipping. Jusell’s violin continues to soar in the combination, often in conversation with Shiroishi’s horn. His playing is ornate but never flowery, expressive but never maudlin, sweet but never saccharine. He is that warmth we carry inside of us on those cold days.\nSetsubun is the Japanese new year. February 2nd. Traditionally people celebrate by screaming in the streets, shooting off fireworks, making a collective ruckus to scare the demons of the year past away. If there aren’t demons to shake off… you must be from a different timeline. So, here is something for you and something for your demons too. Something to keep you warm until Spring arrives. Something warm, familiar, friendly, but fresh and full of possibilities. Happy New Year.",

            "about": "A compendium physical/digital release that collects all four seasons/four albums by Fuubutsushi recorded 2020-2021. The physical edition includes 4 CDs in a fold-out digipak housed with a full color booklet in an O-card sleeve.\nCombining many genres and elements, Fuubutsushi's catalog is one marked by playful and trusting exploration between four musicians; though each loosely assumes a role -- Jusell on violin, Prymek on guitars, Sage on percussion/keys, Shiroishi on woodwinds -- the group has, in their hallmark year of long-distance collaboration, established a free-form vocabulary. Borrowing idioms from ECM, cool jazz, ambient music, minimalism, city pop, post rock, folk, and Americana, this music thoughtfully roams across landscapes like a wandering cloud. At times it falls into valleys, at times in soars far above the surface, it falls and collects in puddles and lakes, it thaws and runs like rivers, it collects in snow banks and freezes solid.\nAfter receiving critical acclaim and high demand, all four albums are now available in this handsome edition and download.",

            "about": "“The desert is hard to look at, it’s too subtle.” — Captain Beefheart\nSKY-CHU is a live taping of a performance on April 15th, 2018, in which Patrick Shiroishi and Zachary Paul, with additional guests Derek Gaines on guitar and Jason Adams on cello, performed an improvised piece inside Jasmin Blasco and David Okum's sound sculpture SKY - CHU /∫u/, at Wilding Cran Gallery in downtown Los Angeles.\nSKY-CHU /∫u/ demands that the listener become aware of the process of listening itself. For the April 15th performance, each viewer/performer was asked to reflect on the moments of transition between interior and exterior listening – listening to oneself vs. listening to the world. The performers were invited to improvise to Blasco's original sound piece, dramatising the spontaneous occurrence of this process.\n/∫u/– the Norwegian word for cloud, spelled “sky”, is pronounced “choo”.",

            "about": "second album by this nine element unit based in Los Angeles\n\"A unified nontet, led by saxophonist Patrick Shiroishi, Danketsu 9 returns after their stunning 2018 cassette Thahrass, with a more ragged horizon. Towards a Walk in the Sun is a dense, dynamic, and entrancing uninterrupted 47-minute live composition recorded at the Heartbeat House in June of 2018. Swirling and sticky strings yawn and gasp, fluttering flute and voice dance in the light, and Shiroishi’s saxophone cries, both maudlin and tender, blowing through the ashes. A finely braided strand of interwoven shambolic free jazz raga, apocalyptic post-rock dread, and neoclassical future-weary dirge, the album sways between sublime melody and looming tension. The group’s chemistry is undeniable as they move about this expanse, giving space for each performer to leave their mark in the moment. Shimmering guitar and flute trills sputter over thick coils of melody and then fall apart into tattered but glittering debris; a cool thumby bass solo punctuated by percussive thumps appears in the rubble. The track title, translated, “One fire goes out, another goes burning,” perfectly captures the openness here; flames lick everything, some surfaces more susceptible to scorching than others. Ash is a rich nutrient for fresh sprouts to poke through.\" - M. Sage",

            "about": "Yellow brings together acclaimed LA-based musicians Kozue Matsumoto, Patrick Shiroishi, and Shoshi Watanabe. With total expressive command of their instruments, the trio unfurls a brilliant and impassioned free improvisation of the highest virtuosic caliber that is at once anguished, defiant, and vigorously hopeful.\nAn astonishing musical work, Yellow is also a powerful political statement. The musicians came together on the basis of a mutual interest in exploring Japanese-American identity. Whereas each musician has variously demonstrated this interest in previous work, Yellow sees them come together to break down the apparent barrier between Japanese instruments and idioms and American avant-garde sensibilities, achieving a unified sound entirely its own without flattening the tensions of its disparate sources. The trio's first meetings were concurrent with a stark rise in discrimination and violence against Asian-Americans – and the titles pull at this: yellow \"Fever\", yellow \"Peril\", yellow \"Skin\". Dirge-like and full of passion, these tracks also register a subtle subversiveness whereby these derogatory slurs are reappropriated and reclaimed musically as fiery, vibrant, and brilliantly textural. This is a music both in defiance of the legacies of prejudice and in celebration of the complexities of identity.\nAn alternative vision of yellow is presented in \"Gold” and \"Dandelions\". In the first instance, the continuity between the tracks suggests a breaking down of social categories towards the horizon of a world enraptured by the unmitigated beauty of its own color. Nevertheless, in these two tracks something different occurs: percussive punctuations of space briefly suspend moments in which suddenly anything might be possible, in which something unforeseen and new might even be spoken. It is these moments which demonstrate that truest virtuosity evident everywhere across the album – a virtuosity which moves beyond mastery over an instrument towards that most profound of the improvisor's abilities to listen deeply. What ultimately emerges from this is the sound of a voice: impassioned and resolute in its refusal to forget the past, in its admonition to face the present, and in its beckoning of a future.\n– Adam Zuckerman",

            "about": "LE087\nFuubutsushi is a quartet featuring Chris Jusell, Chaz Prymek, Matthew Sage, and Patrick Shiroishi. The group creates their recordings by collaborating remotely, with all four members living in different states. They formed their group at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic and completed a four album series based on the seasons from 2020–21.\nArtist notes:\nMatt: This piece departed some from our usual approach which was really refreshing. For a majority of our work the compositions are written mainly by Chaz or myself and then we build from there. On this piece Chris created a structure, a narrative, and started several of the compositions. It was great to be able to add colour to Chris’ narrative and ideas here.\nSo far as inspiration, I think we have so many touchstones for our sound, but I was really excited to be pushed (by Chris) into some melodically complex places that I hadn’t really been before. I am not an expert at working with dissonant melodies, but I think we ended up doing some really interesting things as a group by incorporating dissonance into this composition.\nAs per usual, I am surprised by how our pieces click together. Though we are never in the same room when we work, there is a vitality to how we collaborate that is always exciting to me. This piece is no exception!\nI try to listen deeply to the world as often as possible, and that deep listening hugely informs my solo work as M. Sage, but I think the opportunity to stretch out past conventional song lengths for us as a group, as Fuubutsushi, was an invitation to engage in a very narrative and dynamic kind of collaboration, both as listeners and as musicians.\nI think collaborating remotely how we do demands a kind of listening, at least for me, that is also imaginative; we aren’t just listening closely, or deeply, or slowly, we are also listening to hear the life in our collaborators files and to find where we can live with them there. Listening is an invitation here. To hear a collaborator and hear them make room for another collaborator to contribute to the conversation. Extended deep listening on this project for me is as much about modulating as it is about demodulating.\nPatrick: A lot of the music we have created as a group has had the intention of bringing about different sensations to the listener whether it be through the specific melodies, instrument choice, timbre, field recordings and electronics used. For this piece, we still strive for that same feeling but through a more narrative lens. Stretching out in this ‘longform’ was refreshing and might be an exciting avenue to continue to explore down the line.\nChaz: I used to teach at a Forest School in Missouri, and we had two listening games that we played, the first was to listen and try and hear the thing closest to you, your breath, a fly on you, your jacket swishing, then we would listen to the furthest sound we could hear, then layer by layer fill in the gaps, What did it sound like in the field across the street? What did the trees sound like from where you are standing? What does your breath sound like now? Then compare what each other were hearing and try and hear it that way, often enough we couldn’t hear it the same, but when we put it altogether, we could get a huge picture of what was going on around us.\nThe second game was, I would play a clip of an animal making a call of some sort, without letting any of the kids see the video. They would have to make guesses using all of the sounds from the clip. Who was the animal? What landscape were they in? Where on Earth were they? Wildly enough, the kids, more often than not, would nail it. Or at least get weirdly close.\nThis a lot of my approach to recording. On this project, I gave everybody’s instruments a character, a child, the wind, water, the light, and wrote with that in mind. What could they hear? How did that sound feel to them? What information were they getting from the sounds?\nAlso, to know what’s happening in my friends and bandmates lives when we are making these songs, to already be fans of my bandmates and get to be stoked on what they are making and there for them in their lives outside of music is a means of listening that I feel like permeates our music. To hear friendship and admiration being played.\nChris: Chaz and I both drive around a lot for work, and Chaz sends our group chat (usually active every day) pictures of trees he's climbing or the sky from his car. One day he sent multiple photos of particularly moody weather, and we had already discussed me leading the Longform Editions project as far as ideas/direction. I got excited about the idea of using Chaz's pictures as some sort of narrative arc of mood: looking at the sky throughout a day, and having your feelings and activities decided by that, and especially the tension of seeing clouds pile up and darken and not knowing whether it will actually break into a storm. The band had also created a track that didn't fit onto the last seasonal album that we decided to use as a starting point here; it had samples of beach sounds and a calm, sunny atmosphere. So I mapped out a rough plan for the sky over an afternoon that sees clouds roll in, stress and dissonance accompany that, and (as if squeezed through a vice) rather than rain, the protagonist and listener are transported to the beach. A sort of trade, water for water, like a strange fairy tale.",

            "about": "LE124\nPatrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in Los Angeles.\nDaniel Wyche is a Chicago-based guitarist, composer, and improviser. Working with a wide range of physical preparations, extended techniques, and pedal instruments, his solo recordings and live performances are characterised by long-form structured improvisations and multichannel guitar. He has been a curator with the Elastic Arts Foundation in Chicago since 2013, where is work has been described as “crucial” by Dusted and “vital” by the Chicago Reader. In March of 2020, Daniel co-founded The Quarantine Concerts in collaboration with Chicago’s Experimental Sound Studio. The series has been widely praised as a model for online/streaming live music. Along with his solo guitar work, Daniel is involved in several ongoing collaborations, most notably the trio of Wyche, Mark Shippy (US Maple), and Ben Baker Billington. His new solo record, ‘Earthwork’, was released on American Dreams Records in 2021.\nArtist notes:\nThis music is the second set of recordings Patrick and I have ever done, and it is not a coincidence that this is also the second time we've ever hung out in person. I encountered Patrick’s music through the web of mutual friends and connections, but I think it was primarily through Gabriel Vanlandingham-Dunn that I was inspired to really take a deep and focused listen around 2018. In 2019, I was taking a trip to LA to visit my sister and Patrick and I got in touch and made plans to do some recording as a trio with the percussionist Ted Byrnes. That session had a kind of energy of the time: it was loud, hard, intense, noisey, and chaotic. It was how we were feeling then, that day at least, and with the first note everything was just pure communication. In the time since then, we've collaborated remotely, mostly through the Quarantine Concerts, a series I helped found in March 2020. But with a few years between us, everything is a bit different, everyone in a new headspace and both of us were thinking to try something different. This time, it felt intuitively right to approach this next session with gentleness, patience, care, and maybe even a sort of kindness. So in October 2022, we did what we did the last time we met: made music. And as I said, the intuitions were, for me anyway, just the same, even as the content was different. There was a quiet care right there from the first sounds, and it all just waded into this wash, and here we are.\nFor my part, I try to make the kind of music that I listen to. That means a lot of things, but I spend a large amount of time every day reading and writing, but also just sitting and listening. In all those cases though, even while working, I listen to music that to me makes sense as something that is there, that accompanies my day and what I'm doing, and which cultivates a kind of overall focus, though not in some kind of overly grim way. This is the case even more so with the kind of directed listening I hope that music like this also facilitates. I think we are all indebted to Oliveros and Cage and Ellen Fullman and the many, many others that collectively and individually cultivated and created the conditions and thinking that goes alongside this kind of deep and dedicated listening. I have been very interested in the Wandelweiser Group for years, and as I live in Chicago, I am blessed with the many, many New Music ensembles based here, and have been able to see many performances by and of composers like Jurg Frey, or people like Michael Pisaro. My friend Sarah Hennies is probably my favorite living composer, and she brings all of this into another level: I recall the debut of ‘The Reinvention of Romance’ and I am still holding my breath. But I think at the same time that these examples are both important but misleading. This piece with Patrick is certainly inspired by this general movement of gentleness, of music that asks for your attention, that you can't talk over or you’ll miss a string squeak or the click of a key on the horn, music that feels like you're breathing out. But I think this is also true of the loud, blistering music that Patrick and I made before. So, while they are sonically different, they are spiritually commensurate: this music, however loud and whatever the landscape, will, I hope, call attention to the small details, and invite re-listening and re-hearing in the moments when it is time for listening. We are thankful for the quiet, but we, after all, care a great deal for sound.\n– Daniel Wyche\nMastered by Simon Scoitt at SPS Mastering.",

                    "about": "LE124\nPatrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist and composer based in Los Angeles.\nDaniel Wyche is a Chicago-based guitarist, composer, and improviser. Working with a wide range of physical preparations, extended techniques, and pedal instruments, his solo recordings and live performances are characterised by long-form structured improvisations and multichannel guitar. He has been a curator with the Elastic Arts Foundation in Chicago since 2013, where is work has been described as “crucial” by Dusted and “vital” by the Chicago Reader. In March of 2020, Daniel co-founded The Quarantine Concerts in collaboration with Chicago’s Experimental Sound Studio. The series has been widely praised as a model for online/streaming live music. Along with his solo guitar work, Daniel is involved in several ongoing collaborations, most notably the trio of Wyche, Mark Shippy (US Maple), and Ben Baker Billington. His new solo record, ‘Earthwork’, was released on American Dreams Records in 2021.\nArtist notes:\nThis music is the second set of recordings Patrick and I have ever done, and it is not a coincidence that this is also the second time we've ever hung out in person. I encountered Patrick’s music through the web of mutual friends and connections, but I think it was primarily through Gabriel Vanlandingham-Dunn that I was inspired to really take a deep and focused listen around 2018. In 2019, I was taking a trip to LA to visit my sister and Patrick and I got in touch and made plans to do some recording as a trio with the percussionist Ted Byrnes. That session had a kind of energy of the time: it was loud, hard, intense, noisey, and chaotic. It was how we were feeling then, that day at least, and with the first note everything was just pure communication. In the time since then, we've collaborated remotely, mostly through the Quarantine Concerts, a series I helped found in March 2020. But with a few years between us, everything is a bit different, everyone in a new headspace and both of us were thinking to try something different. This time, it felt intuitively right to approach this next session with gentleness, patience, care, and maybe even a sort of kindness. So in October 2022, we did what we did the last time we met: made music. And as I said, the intuitions were, for me anyway, just the same, even as the content was different. There was a quiet care right there from the first sounds, and it all just waded into this wash, and here we are.\nFor my part, I try to make the kind of music that I listen to. That means a lot of things, but I spend a large amount of time every day reading and writing, but also just sitting and listening. In all those cases though, even while working, I listen to music that to me makes sense as something that is there, that accompanies my day and what I'm doing, and which cultivates a kind of overall focus, though not in some kind of overly grim way. This is the case even more so with the kind of directed listening I hope that music like this also facilitates. I think we are all indebted to Oliveros and Cage and Ellen Fullman and the many, many others that collectively and individually cultivated and created the conditions and thinking that goes alongside this kind of deep and dedicated listening. I have been very interested in the Wandelweiser Group for years, and as I live in Chicago, I am blessed with the many, many New Music ensembles based here, and have been able to see many performances by and of composers like Jurg Frey, or people like Michael Pisaro. My friend Sarah Hennies is probably my favorite living composer, and she brings all of this into another level: I recall the debut of ‘The Reinvention of Romance’ and I am still holding my breath. But I think at the same time that these examples are both important but misleading. This piece with Patrick is certainly inspired by this general movement of gentleness, of music that asks for your attention, that you can't talk over or you’ll miss a string squeak or the click of a key on the horn, music that feels like you're breathing out. But I think this is also true of the loud, blistering music that Patrick and I made before. So, while they are sonically different, they are spiritually commensurate: this music, however loud and whatever the landscape, will, I hope, call attention to the small details, and invite re-listening and re-hearing in the moments when it is time for listening. We are thankful for the quiet, but we, after all, care a great deal for sound.\n– Daniel Wyche\nMastered by Simon Scoitt at SPS Mastering.",

            "about": "Patrick Shiroishi - synths, clarinet, field recordings, voice & tenor saxophone\nPatrick writes: \"I can't recall the first time I was introduced to Touch but it might have been around 2017, right before a duo recording with Zachary Paul in the spring of the following year. I do, however, remember the winter when i dove into their catalogue and discovered artist upon artist of tremendous weight and vision who created worlds in their recordings... it was inspiring and something that I have kept with me through the years.\nSince that time five years ago, correspondence with Touch became little by little, more and more frequent. In early September 2022, Mike contacted me about putting something together for the label with a deadline of a few weeks. I first thought of a collaboration with Bana Haffar, someone for whom I have huge respect on many different levels and was lucky enough to travel with and play some shows for the label's 40th anniversary celebration in the Bay Area earlier this year... unfortunately the timing didn't work out. I pondered about other potential partners, ultimately deciding on the idea of presenting a solo work.\nFamiliarising myself with the Touch back catalogue, I wanted to create a work that was unique in its own world. Someone reading this may or may not know that I have been diving into my family history and processing that through music. Last year, I took a couple of trips to Evergreen Cemetery in Los Angeles, where several generations of Shiroishis are buried and a place often visited when growing up. Sitting there with my Zoom recorder on, at what seemed like the peak of the violence towards Asian Americans, i felt at peace being close to them.\nThe foundations of this album are from those recordings. The first half is built upon one I made during daytime and the second half from a recording in the evening. The music took on many forms and was worked on daily in the mornings, which is something that was very different from my usual practice. As the album was getting close to being finished, I sent it over to Mike and Jon and with their guidance helped to shape the music towards its final form.\nHoping that you listen to this music in one sitting and think about your ancestors as you do - we all come from somewhere, and there is not a moment when they are not with you.\"\nPatrick Shiroishi is a Japanese-American multi-instrumentalist & composer based in Los Angeles. He is perhaps best known for his extensive and intense work with the saxophone. Over the last decade he has established himself as one of the premier improvising musicians in Los Angeles, recording and playing solo and in numerous collaborative projects. Shiroishi may well be considered a foundational player in the city's vast musical expanse. [Chris Lowenthal]",

            "about": "Brandon Shimoda is someone that I have the immense pleasure of calling a friend & collaborator. He has a huge presence in the Japanese American community, not only as an organizer & facilitator, but also writing poems & novels examining, processing & expressing what all of us in the community feel. During the day, Brandon is a professor at Colorado College. It is there, on the 80th anniversary of the signing of Executive Order 9066, that I had the privilege to be on a panel with other descendants of the camps to share and talk about our work. It was a truly beautiful experience – i've never openly discussed the camps and what they meant to me, so to do so with other artists really warmed my soul.\nWhen I was putting together my record 'I was too young to hear silence', that event was still ringing true in my heart. Nervously, I decided to ask Brandon if he would write the liner notes for the album... he graciously agreed. What he sent back was perfect, something only he could do – part non-fiction, part fiction, part Japanese dreamscape, part me. And part him.\n'The Afterlife is Letting Go' is the name of Brandon's book that also comes out on 12th December 2024. In the early stages of writing, we talked about there being some sort of music that would accompany the book, a soundtrack to it if you will. After reading, sitting, and re-reading the book, these two pieces make up my physical processing of his words. if you listen to this & feel something, anything, i urge you to pick up this book & spend some time with it. i promise you it will be worth it.

            "about": "‘Greyhound Days’ strikes a shared note of spontaneity and intention. Featuring pieces for tenor saxophone and digital keyboard, and accented by traces of additional instruments, these songs sound a fated exchange mutually effortless and expansive.\nShiroishi and Kurek were first brought together to record new music for one of BBC Radio 3’s remote collaborative sessions, the fruits of which aired on Jennifer Lucy Allan’s Late Junction show on Groundhog Day 2024. The easy dialogue that quickly emerged between the two continued to flow after the show, guiding tracks that weigh a joint attraction to intuitive expressions and the simple tenderness of first takes.\nThe collaborations collected here speak to an open spirit of trust and discovery as the duo’s light-footed sonics interact with a deft grace. The album frames this dynamic call and response with Shiroishi and Kurek making space for each other’s distinct voices as much as their eloquently mirrored gestures.\nText by Natalia Panzer",
